links 7 references publication history edit glorious godfrey first appeared in the forever people 3 june 1971 and was created by jack kirby 2 in 1971 an article in the new york times magazine about relevant comics described a handsome toothy character named glorious godfrey a revivalist godfrey is drawn to look like an actor playing billy graham in a hollywood film biography of richard nixon starring george hamilton 3 the character was intended to embody the powerful charismatic speaker who could talk people into justifying violence and evil 4 fictional character biography edit godfrey has a sister named amazing grace who is also a member of darkseid s elite the siblings have similar powers whereas amazing grace s specialty is manipulation godfrey s is persuasion 5 in his first appearance he confronts the forever people who had stumbled upon a recruitment program for earth based warriors for darkseid he personally leads an attack of justifiers that almost kills the young warrior serafin despite the efforts of the forever people s semi sentient super cycle godfrey s attack would have succeeded in killing serafin however highfather chose at that moment to recall all his people and the cycle home via teleportation 6 godfrey remained a relatively unimportant character until 1986 he had a total of three appearances over a decade and a half when legends the first crossover since the crisis on infinite earths was published in it darkseid attempts to deprive the world of its heroes not only so that they would be ineffective against darkseid but also in the hopes that the people of earth would more willingly surrender to his rule g gordon godfrey artist john byrne the first phase of the plan consists simply of creating immense amounts of collateral damage by sending creatures to earth to fight the superheroes the public begins to resent the heroes in their midst and therefore darkseid starts the second phase of his plan by sending the master manipulator glorious godfrey to earth assuming the identity of g gordon godfrey a reference to g gordon liddy he starts a hate campaign against the superheroes that proves to be very effective riling the public and ultimately leading to a presidential decision to outlaw any super heroic activity the final phase of the plan consists of the apokoliptian warhounds cybernetic creatures that are bonded to human hosts for which godfrey is able to find an ample number of volunteers among his hypnotized public he leads his charges to washington d c only to be confronted by a cadre of assembled heroes 2 the heroes are able to defeat the warhounds and separate them from their human hosts with godfrey jeopardising his image when he strikes a little girl who had been standing between the heroes and godfrey s group of adults after his initial weak attempt to justify his attack fails godfrey makes one last ploy by putting on the helmet of doctor fate in the hopes of obtaining his awesome might instead the helmet mindwipes godfrey leaving him nothing more than an empty shell he is sent to belle reve sanitarium which he would later be broken out of by the female furies under the order of darkseid godfrey has subsequently made brief appearances among assemblages of all the apokoliptian gods final crisis edit in final crisis 1 reverend godfrey good appears on a tv news report decrying the situation in blüdhaven and the lack of government aid and assistance in dealing with the crisis in the ruined city 7 in between final crisis 1 and 2 good is captured and transformed into a host for the essence of glorious godfrey godfrey taunts dan turpin and batman as batman is imprisoned and turpin transformed into the final host body for darkseid in final crisis 4 godfrey is present when darkseid takes control over turpin s body however in final crisis 5 darkseid responds to his minion s impending death presumably due to the fact that godfrey s host body was not modified to successfully contain godfrey s dark essence by watching them die in front of him 8 a one shot revealed that godfrey had been chosen by darkseid to be the secretive personal assistant to the earth based villain libra the man is given generic technology to support him throughout the years because darkseid believed the man had potential for greatness godfrey s assistance turns out to be invaluable as libra is the key to darkseid s defeat of earth 9 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe glorious godfrey makes his first appearance by giving greetings to batman and ra s al ghul from apokolips he has a new look sporting a beard and an all black uniform with red gloves and belt 10 glorious godfrey s reason for coming to earth is to retrieve the chaos shard a powerful crystal which once belonged to darkseid which ra s al ghul revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for damian after detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside damian s body and despite the assistance of the justice league glorious godfrey escapes with the corpse back to apokolips with batman vowing to get damian wayne s corpse back 11 powers and abilities edit glorious godfrey retains several attributes of a native of apokolips such as a limited level of superhuman strength endurance and invulnerability in addition godfrey has extended lifespan which allows him to exist indefinitely and he has an advanced immune system however glorious godfrey is a sub par athlete and hand to hand combatant whose greatest gifts are his overwhelming speaking voice and his extraordinary powers of persuasion whether these are natural gifts or have been augmented by the power of darkseid has yet to be determined godfrey employs a private army called the justifiers composed of earthmen who believe godfrey s rhetoric and have had their perceptions completely contorted by godfrey s words the special helmets worn by the justifiers allow glorious godfrey to control his soldiers even when they are not in his presence inspiration edit jack kirby biographer mark evanier states that glorious godfrey was based on evangelist billy graham a lesser villain who toiled in the service of darkseid was inspired more directly by evangelist billy graham who was then rather difficult to avoid on tv kirby was appalled at some of graham s apocalyptic sermons which to jack were more calculated to instill fear than faith and to stampede people into service of graham s causes jack called the foe glorious godfrey the name being a kirbyesque pun the comic book evangelist was god free and also had some of the traits of tv pitchman arthur godfrey though the main reference and the visual came from billy graham not evident in on the pages he drew was jack s belief which he expressed on several occasions that graham and the president he counseled were both virulent anti semites 12 in other media edit television edit glorious g gordon godfrey appears in the justice league

page of the first issue greeting his master jor el upon his return jor el then orders him to bring the baby kal el who would become superman in his birthing matrix it is revealed in conversation with another of jor el s servant robots that kelex had served jor el for all of his life much longer than the other robot had and had never seen him like this the robot didn t appear for the rest of the issue nor for the rest of the miniseries he was presumably destroyed along with the planet krypton 2 later when a kryptonian device known as the eradicator was obtained by superman it tries to recreate krypton on earth beginning with the south pole in the antarctic superman stops it but the attempt had created the fortress of solitude along with the fortress had been created a group of robotic servants one of which was a recreation of kelex he is largely indistinguishable from the other kryptonian robots who maintained the fortress he attends the false eradicator version of superman who had taken up residence in the fortress 3 kelex is used as a framing device for a tour of a redesigned fortress of solitude 4 the fortress of solitude is dramatically redesigned when dominus took

the back up story the strange experiment of dr erdel in detective comics 225 november 1955 written by joseph samachson and illustrated by joe certa note 1 the character is a green skinned humanoid from mars who is pulled to earth by an experimental teleportation beam constructed by dr saul erdel the martian tells erdel where he is from and is told that to send him back will require the computer brains thinking plot to be changed the shock of the encounter kills dr erdel and leaves j onzz with no way of returning home the character decides to fight crime while waiting for martian technology to advance to a stage that will enable his rescue 1 to that end he adopts the identity of john jones a detective in the fictional middletown usa 2 during this period the character and his backstory differ in some minor and some significant ways from modern treatments firstly as with his counterpart the silver age superman j onzz s power range is poorly defined and his powers expand over time as the plot demands the addition of precognitive abilities detective comics 226 is quickly followed by telepathy and flight 3 4 atomic vision super hearing 5 and many other powers in addition his customary weakness to fire is only manifested when he is in his native martian form a more significant difference is that in this version of him there is no suggestion that mars is a dead planet or that the character is the last of his kind many of the tales of the time feature either martian technology or the appearance of other martian characters such as his elder brother t omm j onzz 6 detective comics 236 october 1956 for example features the character making contact with the planet mars and his parents j onzz eventually reveals his existence to the world after which he operates openly as a superhero and becomes a charter member of the justice league during the character s initial few years as a member of the justice league he is often used as a substitute for superman in stories just as green arrow was for batman as dc comics were worried about using their flagship characters too often in justice league stories fearing overexposure 7 the martian and the archer inaugurated the team up format of the brave and the bold 8 j onzz appears there one other time working with the flash 9 in some stories he is shown travelling through space at near light speed 10 or to other planets 11 the detective john jones is ostensibly killed in action by the idol head of diabolu an artifact which generates supernatural monsters j onzz abandons the civilian identity as he decides fighting this new menace will take a great deal of his time 12 at this point his feature moves to the house of mystery where j onzz spends the next few years in battle against the idol head 13 shortly after its defeat he takes the persona of marco xavier in order to infiltrate the international crime cartel known as vulture which he defeats in the final installment of his original series 14 as superman was allowed by dc to become a fully active member of the justice league j onzz s appearances there dwindled he last participated in a mission in his original tenure in 61 march 1968 shortly before his solo series was discontinued the house of mystery 173 may june 1968 in 71 his people finally came to earth for him and he left with them to found and become leader of new mars 15 over the next 15 years j onzz appeared sporadically in various dc titles bronze age 1970s mid 1980s edit in 1972 superman was teleported to new mars 16 j onzz briefly returned to earth via spaceship in 1975 17 j onzz made another trip to earth shortly thereafter 18 leading to superman and batman fighting alongside him on new mars 19 three years later he was discovered playing cosmic level chess with despero using jla ers as the pieces 20 the martian again encountered superman in outer space 21 he permanently resurfaced in the dc universe in 1984 22 shortly thereafter the league had several members resign among many other changes leaving an opening for the manhunter 23 while staying on earth he decided to revive his john jones identity this time as a private detective but had to explain his 20 year disappearance 24 post crisis mid 1980s mid 1990s edit j onn j onzz trying and failing to relax in his true form and reflecting on his history with the league in early 1987 dc revamped its struggling justice league of america series by re launching the title as justice league this new series written by keith giffen and j m dematteis with art by kevin maguire and later adam hughes added quirky humor to the team s stories j onzz is present from the first issue and within the stories is used as a straight man for other characters in comical situations the series also added a number of elements to his back story that have remained to the present such as j onzz s obsession with chocos cookies due to shazam s influence the 1988 four issue miniseries martian manhunter by j m dematteis and mark badger further redefined the character and changed a number of important aspects of both his character and his origin story it is revealed that dr erdel did not die and that the character s humanoid appearance was due to physiological trauma and attempts to block out the death of his race his familiar appearance a compromise between his true form and a human appearance based upon erdel s mental concept of what a martian should look like later series use retroactive continuity retcon to establish that his real form is private and that even on mars his public appearance was the familiar version the native name for mars is said to be ma aleca andra in his native language a nod to malacandra the name used by the inhabitants of mars in c s lewis novel out of the silent planet citation needed the series also adds to canon the idea that j onzz was not only displaced in space but in time and the martian race including j onzz s wife and daughter has been dead for thousands of years 25 the 1990s saw the character continue to serve in many different versions of the justice league of america in addition to serving in the league under his own identity he also joins under duress disguised as bloodwynd a mysterious and powerful necromancer 26 j onzz assumed the physical form stand offish mannerisms and magical powers of bloodwynd while bloodwynd himself was transported and trapped inside of his blood gem it was during this time the jla engaged doomsday in the death of superman series after being hurled by doomsday into a burning building blue beetle discovers the merged identity of the two heroes soon after it is revealed that j onzz had accidentally bonded with bloodwynd prior to his joining the league the two are eventually separated and 27 both continue their associations with the league the 1992 miniseries american secrets is set in the character s past exploring a previously unknown adventure against the backdrop of a changing america during the 1950s

ongoing series in 1998 written by john ostrander and illustrated by tom mandrake with fill in art provided by bryan hitch among others the series lasted 38 issues before being canceled due to low sales ostrander established that martian manhunter is the most recognized hero in the southern hemisphere and that he maintains a number of different secret identities many of them outside the united states however following two incidents later in the series in which john jones separates from martian manhunter volume issue needed he decides to focus on his original human identity and retire the others the series establishes that j onzz has a disturbed brother ma alefa ak who uses his shape shifting abilities to pose as j onzz capturing and torturing jemm son of saturn and terraforming part of earth to resemble mars areoforming this is all part of a grand plan designed to convince the rest of the justice league that j onzz has turned into a sociopath however j onzz is able to clear his name and defeat ma alefa ak despite having most of his body destroyed in an exploding spaceship he is able to regenerate his body from his severed hand after transplanting his soul into his hand and sending it back to his home fortress so that it can regenerate the series also further established the history of both the manhunter and the saturnian race the first issue revealed that there was a real human john jones a police detective who is murdered by corrupt colleagues and that j onzz subsequently assumed his identity to complete an important court case in issues of jla written by joe kelly j onzz attempts to conquer his fear of fire and makes a deal with a flame wielding villainess named scorch who wants j onzz s telepathic help in dealing with her own mental issues the two falling in love in the process 28 this effort results in j onzz briefly transforming into the burning martian fernus an ancient version of the martian race that were modified by the guardians of the universe the guardians had recognized the danger that the burning martians posed to civilized life as they reproduced through the psychic energy generated by suffering and grief but had simply engineered the martians into their new state rather than destroy them as part of this engineering the martians had been programmed with a new vulnerability to fire with j onzz breaking the genetic blocks against fire also giving him access to race memories of the burning martians 29 despite fernus power the league were able to help j onzz reassert himself over fernus manitou raven helping key league members access j onzz s mind and draw out his true self while plastic man battled fernus directly 30 allowing the true j onzz to manifest when fernus attempted to spawn using the psychic grief caused by the destruction of the city of chongjin the sorrow enough for at least one spawning even if the flash had saved the city s residents with fernus physical form defeated j onzz s traditional aversion to fire was redefined as he is now invulnerable to flames unless they are flames of passion or of some other psychic significance 31 this change is forgotten about in later series and

organization which had previously appeared exclusively in comics set in dc s wildstorm comics imprint 50 j onzz is initially stated as being an ex justice league member in stormwatch 1 51 before the phrase with the justice league is retconned as shorthand for being a public superhero with j onzz saying he never tried to join the league due to his commitments to stormwatch this same position is stated by j onzz again in legion lost vol 2 6 52 however later justice league comics show that j onzz was indeed a member of the league for a time 53 54 later dc chose to move martian manhunter to its

lived there mars was originally a living thriving world millions of years ago after received a psychic warning a young j onn was recruited along with others by the martian government to investigate a potential threat he was eventually betrayed by fellow again ma alefa ak who murdered all of the subjects except j onn he was then subjected to a magic blood ritual that gave him his powers after escaping he began to hunt down ma alefa ak only to discover a monster which was the cause of the psychic warning the monster taking the shape of j onn j onzz s son revealed that it was the physical manifestation of mars saying that it needed help only to believe that the martians were unworthy of life as a result mars and all of its inhabitants died and j onn was sent to earth before he landed he split himself into multiply identities that would not reunite until millions of years later but with no memories of his origins martian manhunter seeming died while tried to stop a series of bombings however it was revealed that there were still pieces of him that lived on after he landed on earth and they begun to bring him back together after being teleported to a alternate mars ma alefa ak revealed to be another construct of j onn s memories plans to use them in another ritual to bring back that actual mars with him as its ruler after this plane was foiled j onn was later revived with all of the remaining constructs merging back with him finally coming to accept that he truly is the last martian 59 dc rebirth 2016 present edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it january 2018 prior to the events of dark nights metal j onn had left to thanagar looking for nth metal after freeing an imprisoned mister terrific green lantern and plastic man three dark knights appeared and used thanagar s phoenix cannon to fire plastic man at earth s core causing a chain reaction that will drag everything into the dark multiverse he was imprisoned by the dark knights along with other heroes but was rescued by wonder woman to help battle the forces of barbatos the heroes won but at the cost of the destruction of the source wall following the conclusion of no justice he rejoins the justice league as its new chairman powers and abilities edit j onzz possesses a wide variety of abilities native to the green martian race such as super strength durability flight regeneration shapeshifting intangibility invisibility telepathy telekinesis extrasensory input and heat vision physical edit the martian manhunter has shapeshifting abilities he often takes the human disguise of detective john jones he has often been shown to grow an extra pair of arms to supplement his fighting abilities and his strength such as when he helped move 1 3 of the earth with both superman and wonder woman knocked out shazam once stopping a ship many times larger than the planet from colliding with earth in tandem with superman and destroying the moon whose gravity was increased a billion fold to the point it was tearing off the earth s crust and ejecting every continent to the atmosphere he can become stiff or malleable as well as alter the size and length of limbs he has elongated parts of himself into bladed weapons during combat his density is also variable and changes as he wills it he can use this ability to become intangible and move through objects or allow attacks to fly harmlessly through him or to become extremely dense and increase his invulnerability j onzz can also become invisible in addition to these powers he can fly and possesses super strength psionic mental psychic and extrasensory edit j onn j onzz is the most powerful telepath on earth being able to control and affect even the spectre and doctor fate with his telepathy aquaman has stated that martian manhunter s telepathy exceeds even the telepathy of other members of the martian race he said that with j onzz s great telepathic power his own telepathy just pings off of him while when aquaman was in the presence of j onzz s brother ma alefa ak there was no such effect j onzz is capable of linking the minds of all superheroes at once from a distance of the moon to all corners of earth even once scanning the entire galaxy to see if anyone was not experiencing a brief moment of transcendent bliss he is also capable of reading the minds of all inhabitants of earth at once his telepathic abilities also allow him to create realistic illusions telepathically trace and locate people shut down people s minds brain blast mental shield influence thoughts mind control people manipulate memory astral projection possession induce sleep reprogram or reorder minds and transfer information directly into people s brains the martian manhunter s mind control capabilities have allowed him to mind control the joker and make him temporarily sane as well as mind controlling several white martians at once he is also capable of mentally shielding those around him from telepathic assault his own mental defenses are so strong that he is able to telepathically shield himself from the combined might of several white martians and from the mageddon machinery he has at times also demonstrated limited telekinetic abilities though such showings are rare and often forgotten enhanced martian senses edit j onzz possesses martian vision allowing his eyes to see across the electromagnetic spectrum including x ray vision he can also project energy beams known as martian beams the exact effects of which have varied in different decades from incendiary effects to concussive impacts to disintegration j onzz also has nine senses compared to humans giving him clearer and more numerous perceptions 60 natural skills and talents edit aside from his superpowered abilities as a martian j onzz is also a very capable detective and sleuth due to his training as a manhunter in mars he is also an expert tracker and hand to hand combatant far above the average martian as he has been shown able to defeat many white martians at once 61 as batman mentions in his file in many ways martian manhunter is like an amalgam of superman and the dark knight himself 62 clarification needed weakness and limitations edit one of j onzz s signature traits is his vulnerability to fire although it has been an element of the character since his earliest appearances it has been depicted differently by writers throughout the character s long career in his earliest appearances he was shown as having a weakness to fire while in his native martian form 63 over time this was developed into pyrophobia with fire being the martian s achilles heel equivalent to superman s weakness to kryptonite exposure to fire typically causes j onzz to lose his ability to maintain his physical form so that he melts into a pool of writhing green plasma one portrayal explained that the flame weakness was tied into martian telepathy with fire causing so much chaos in martian minds that they collapse volume issue needed it was revealed during the trial by fire storyline 64 that the martian weakness to fire is a built in psychosomatic effect placed in the martian race long ago by the guardians of the universe to prevent them from reverting to a previous evolutionary state in which they were highly aggressive on the verge of interstellar conquest and in need of flames and the psychic suffering of others in order to reproduce at the end of the arc this weakness to mundane fire was removed with j onzz explaining that now only fires of psychic significance could harm him such as flames of a magical or pyrokinetic nature or even flames created by an arsonist during the fernus storyline batman noted that martian shapeshifting was an instantaneous reflex based around the psychic study of others allowing j onzz to adapt rapidly to any opponent s physiology or fighting style curiously this aspect of his power puts him at a slight disadvantage when faced with plastic man who is immune to telepathy and who has no set fighting style but is instead described as inspiration given form a completely spontaneous and unpredictable being 65 in the new 52 the weakness to fire is pyrophobia that is unique to him as a crippling anxiety due to the trauma of witnessing the fiery death of his race an explanation previously established in the 1988 martian manhunter miniseries 25

invisibly j onzz herds moran and the rest of his gang into the hands of the police the headmaster real name thaddeus romero hoskins an arrogant elitist born to a rich family hoskins graduated m i t at the age of fifteen however hoskins social skills never developed properly and he felt alienated by all around him he feared mankind will die out if they stayed on earth becoming extinct like the dinosaurs hoskins was inspired to develop a robotic model for military application that consisted of an inhuman head attached to spidery legs dubbed a headman it could decapitate enemy soldiers in the field and reanimate their bodies to act as cannon fodder for its controllers those in scientific circles including john henry irons were unaware of the robot moving beyond the theoretical stage later hoskins body was discovered his head detached by a laser and his brain missing entirely in a powerful new bipedal shell hoskins renamed himself the headmaster and set his master plan into motion he re purposed a former norad installation dubbed the ark and designed as a nuclear bomb shelter from here the headmaster set to work on a massive spaceship that could carry the finest examples of humanity off their home planet in need of a work force to carry out the task the headmaster created an army of headmen he then sent them out to kill and commandeer the bodies of homeless people to construct his craft the murders of two police officers who stumbled upon one of headmaster s victims under the control of a headman attracted the attention of private investigator john jones secretly the martian manhunter using his shapeshifting abilities to assume the visage of a derelict j onzz staked out an alley until he was attacked by a headman after being wounded in a struggle with the device the martian manhunter took its remains to the jla watchtower for further study with the aid of steel and oracle the manhunter located the ark and its contents the headmaster met with j onzz hoping to convince him of the merits of his plan so that he would not lose precious time by abandoning the base dedicated to the preservation of all life equally treasured the martian manhunter declared himself the headmaster s implacable foe a scuffle ensued which ended with the martian manhunter burying the headmaster under his own spaceship the damage headmaster took deactivated his headman and pieces of his robotic armor were uncovered after an explosion leveled the ark it is unclear whether hoskins brain was still within the headmaster body or if he is perhaps still at large 68 the headmen a robotic military group led by the headmaster the headmen were spider like robots created by hoskins to do his bidding with heads resembling the headmaster s standing at roughly two feet tall with long arachnid legs tipped with blades the headmen were controlled by human brains wiped clean and reprogrammed the headmen were often assigned the task of decapitating derelicts dipping their spiked limbs into their victim s chest cavity and replacing their headspace with its own the headmen could then animated the deceased bodies to perform most motor functions to facilitate this act the headmen were armed spectacularly a laser beam emitted from their right ocular cavity could kill most people on contact and were capable of momentarily blinding one of the most powerful superbeings on earth their electronic eyes were further enhanced with thermal and radar imaging the headman robots were physically resistant to incredible amounts of damage and were both quick and agile the prophet the ancient holy man k rkzar traveled the known universe to sit with instructors of every religion in his pursuit of the one spiritual truth long ago he paid a visit to mars learning of their gods such as h ronmeer eventually k rkzar went into a centuries long seclusion to process all he had absorbed from his quest when his intended emergence to discuss his findings was announced this causes the leaders of many organized religions in the universe to scream for his head as luck would have it j onzz decided on that very moment in time to seek out k rkzar in hopes he might have information about other survivors from mars he instead found himself one of k rkzar s few defenders in the midst of a holy war it was widely believed that k rkzar s trusted disciple fellow priest bruaka was the only being aware of k rkzar s whereabouts the martian manhunter joined a small group of agents in taking bruaka into protective custody with legions of bloodthirsty zealots in pursuit the reptilian church head paral was a central figure in organizing an unprecedented alliance of faiths all for the sole purpose of destroying k rkzar before he can spread his blasphemy across the universe as the manhunter and his group consistently evaded these forces paral chose to unleash the power and the wrath of the prophet the prophet spoke almost entirely in the scripture of his deity grud as he matched the martian manhunter blow for blow in battle upon asteroids in the vacuum of deep space the prophet was distracted when the ship he had been pursuing exploded in a kamikaze style collision with the vessel of the fundamentalist s aides this gave j onzz both the hostility and the opportunity needed to overtake the prophet busting his scepter and throttling him unconscious k rkzar delivered his simple message of peace and the prophet has yet to reemerge 69 the human flame a villain who wore a special suit that allowed him to project fire which is the weakness of the martian manhunter he was the first actual supervillain the martian manhunter faced kanto darkseid s master assassin he fought j onzz during the attack on mars the two have been bitter rivals ever since ma alefa ak also called malefic the twin brother and archenemy of the martian manhunter he was created by john ostrander and tom mandrake the character first appeared in martian manhunter vol 2 0 october 1998 the brother of j onzz ma alefa ak was the only member of the martian race born without telepathy and a weakness to fire feeling ostracized because of his genetic differences ma alefa ak was the architect of an extinction level event this event was known as h ronmeer s curse h ronmeer s curse was a plague of fire this curse attacked martians via their telepathic abilities whenever a martian attempted to use their telepathic gifts or commune with the great mind they would fall victim to the curse and ultimately burn to death with the exception of ma alefa ak s brother j onzz and himself nearly all green martians on the planet died as a result of ma alefa ak s handiwork for centuries ma alefa ak continued to live in the ruins of mars unaware that his brother had survived the plague and had been transported through space and time to the planet earth several years ago ma alefa ak learned of j onzz s existence and followed him back to earth in an effort to complete the genocide of the martian race by destroying its last surviving son ma alefa ak has tried many times to finish his work and kill his brother j onzz but has not succeeded ma alefa ak has all the same powers as other martians except for telepathy ma alefa ak also does not have the weakness to fire like other martians do he worships darkseid as his god in turn undermining the independence of martian history and helped to inspire the anti life equation that has cost countless lives the marshal genetically altered to be the perfect martian warrior the marshal towered over his soldiers he tried to invade earth the master gardener the master gardener and his shapeshifting assistant the lizard man came to earth during world war ii and took advantage of the terror and confusion of the time to infiltrate governments and communications cartels they grew plants bearing fungus that bonded to the human nervous system allowing them to control the very words they spoke under threat of spontaneous combustion mister v a k a faceless leader of vulture mongul an alien warlord who tried to force j onzz to give him the key to a super weapon professor arnold hugo an evil genius originally a batman enemy in his second appearance he fought j onzz and went on to become his first recurring foe robo chargers gigantic monstrosities which seemingly combined elements of both androids and tanks the robo chargers were designed for war and employed by the thythen fueled by the life force of living beings the robo chargers were used to police the planet vonn their unconscious batteries were hung from girders and had their essence drained through helmets connected with networks of cable to the robo chargers the robo chargers stood several stories tall and moved through rocky terrain with great speed on tank treads the constructs were covered in turrets called projectors which fired blasts that could disintegrate a target the design of their upper bodies were humanoid complete with head chest arms and five fingered hands including opposable thumbs the robo chargers had large antennae likely used to receive commands from the thythen who also bore antennae whether communication with the thythen was telepathic was not made clear but this seems most likely to have been the case with the martians 70 thythen the thythen were warmongers engaged in a cosmic struggle with their neighbors according to writing found on a tablet and translated by j onzz within the alien arsenal the thythen invaded the planet vonn and preyed upon the native people there in order to escape the thythen this people abandoned their world and broadcast themselves to a distant solar system three members of the thythen an unholy trinity remained on vonn to charge their robo chargers with the remaining inhabitants life force these victims included a group of green martians who had survived mars devastation and found their way to vonn the thythen camp was located in the west where their domed headquarters and the girders that held the robo chargers batteries could be seen from afar the thythen seemed to have no compunctions about exploiting the life energies of their prisoners while treating them inhumanely they also encouraged the traitorous bel juz to lure others into a trap to expand their herd of the three thythen on vonn two were disintegrated by their own robo chargers after they were taken over by the minds of the martians the third traveled from vonn in the alien arsenal before being defeated by superman how this thythen was managed afterward is unknown 70 tor the ghost of a robot criminal from mars martian scientists among them j onzz constructed a nigh indestructible robot of vast strength and intellect to serve their planet forever j onzz was apprehensive about the result and rightly so when a fellow scientist accidentally fed a master criminal thought control card into the tor control board tor s mechanical brain quickly absorbed its crime facts via a remote electronic connection and the robot began to function as a violent criminal tor proceeded to ravage mars its appetite for material possessions and the general rule implacable unable to reason with tor or damage it with martian weapons j onzz devised a plan to use the robot s greed against it tor was lured onto a rocket ship with the false rumor of riches within and blasted off to the dead planet of turas there it discovered that the solar dust on the planet would slowly destroy even its impressive being through unknown means tor eventually learned of j onzz s own exile to earth tor spent months developing machines that would allow it to mentally control an earthling as well as somehow make the host immune to harm tor succeeded in taking control of the gangster marty kirk just 24 hours before tor s fated destruction and set upon a campaign of revenge despite tor s best efforts in kirk s body j onzz managed to elude the robot until its remaining 24 hours were nearly up tor made a last ditch effort to ruin j onzz by revealing his presence to his adopted world but j onzz set a fire that led to tor s exorcism from kirk 71 vulture an international crime syndicate whom j onzz infiltrated for some time before finally

control over his remaining telepathy and at batman s request makes a mind scan of captain marvel the effort of which is shown to very nearly overwhelm him despite showing a willingness to stay and

who was an on again off again romantic interest of jimmy olsen lucy s silver age appearances often revolved around jimmy s various attempts at romancing her a wedding took place in superman s pal jimmy olsen issue 100 march 1967 which was intended to be a permanent change to the comic s status quo but editor mort weisinger changed his mind at the last minute and had writer leo dorfman change the ending to include a sudden annulment of the marriage 6 the character was believed to have died in superman s girl friend lois lane 120 march 1972 7 but was later revived in a story in superman s pal jimmy olsen 160 october 1973 8 lucy was reintroduced into dc comics continuity in the man of steel 5 december 1986 9 lucy was an air traffic controller but became affected by a mysterious blindness implied to have poisoned by lex luthor that was cured as a side effect of the destruction of a bizarro clone 10 lucy returned to her job and had a brief relationship with jimmy olsen after many encounters with super villains such as sleez 11 deathstroke 12 and even becoming a vampire bride 13 she eventually started dating african american daily planet staff member ron troupe when lucy became pregnant her conservative father was enraged although lucy explained there s not a racist bone in daddy s body he hates all his daughters beaus sam lane eventually overcame his anger when lucy and ron were married and their child was born new krypton edit after a long disappearance from the principal storylines lucy lane returns in the one shot superman new krypton her past with ron troupe is unclear they are possibly estranged troupe having resurfaced in the current storylines working again with the daily planet her long disappearance is explained by her joining the military in a desperate post mortem attempt to appease her presumed dead father s desire to have a son able to carry on his career in the military bitter and angrier than in her former appearances she still blames lois for general sam lane s apparent death during the war against imperiex essentially she thinks lois broke his heart by putting her love for superman before her duties as a daughter lucy references her former appearances even mentioning her dating boys in lois circle as failed attempts to live her life through her more successful sister but she eventually chooses to sacrifice her life and live the military career her father intended for lois driving an even deeper wedge between the two sisters unbeknownst to her their father is still alive and working with the government superwoman edit lucy lane as superwoman art by jamal igle lucy first appeared as superwoman in supergirl 35 her costume a nod to that of the bronze age superwoman kristin wells and containing a containment field that simulated kryptonian powers lucy s identity was not revealed until near the story arc s end during her tenure as superwoman she was ordered by her father general sam lane to kill agent liberty who had been spying on general lane and lex luthor 14 she later attacked reactron which tipped off readers that superwoman was not kryptonian in that the villain s gold kryptonite power source had no effect on her 15 supergirl unmasks superwoman 16 and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit causing lucy s body to contort and explode 17 in supergirl annual 1 readers are given the current modern backstory of lucy lane in the story lucy since the moment she was born has felt overshadowed by her big sister lois lucy always felt that lois outperformed her overshadowed her and was more loved by their father lucy never blames lois but she blames her parents sam and ella feeling that by maybe being closer to lois her father would pay more attention to her lucy moved to the same city but this came at the same time lois and her father grew apart over superman after her father s death lucy joined the army being a great soldier and a woman lucy rose quickly in the ranks during the amazon attack on the united states lucy was nearly killed by two amazons but was saved by codename assassin awaking in project 7734 her father is able to convince lucy to put on the superwoman suit which possessed mystical qualities although seemingly dead lucy s remains steal the lifeforce of a man who came too close 18 when lucy is recovered by general lane s forces they learn that the suit s mystic energies have somehow transformed her into an actual kryptonian 19 following the war of the supermen storyline lucy is in custody in s t a r labs by kimiyo hoshi and gangbuster who are attempting to remove lucy s metahuman abilities after interference by an object that crashes into a metropolis park before they leave lucy s holding cell it is shown seemingly to have lightly cracked 20 later lucy is visited by her sister lois who wants to talk lucy is unhelpful as she has completely given in to insanity 21 lois tells lucy that she is disgusted by her and walks away leaving lucy in s t a r labs custody behind 22 although the crack in the cell seemed to hint at lucy escaping at some point nothing came of it and once the new 52 was launched all storylines in progress in dc were dropped in favor of the new continuity the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline lucy lane is first seen where she was picked up from the train station by lois after clark kent was unable to fulfill his promise to lois to do it himself 23 later to make up for it clark accompanies her lois johnathan carrol and morgan edge to the most expensive restaurant in town but is later forced to leave her with the check due to his duties as superman 24 clark later makes it up to her by taking her bungee jumping an activity which lucy enjoys 25 lucy befriended and later became roommates with olivia after they met while white water rafting they also adopted a cat named simon olivia became ill and doctor obeshian gave her drugs to take the drugs having secretly been taken from an alien fungus which would mutate the user into a shapeshifting creature lucy and olivia both took the pills resulting in the later turning into a wolf like creature and the former into a giant insect like creature an organization named the cartel began kidnapping users of the drug which had begun circulating on the streets for detox and they managed to capture olivia lucy convinced lois to save olivia in her insect form lucy rescued lois and olivia from the cartel s base the issue ended with lois comforting a hysterical lucy citation needed powers and abilities edit although superwoman originally had no inherent powers her powersuit altered her dna via a containment field to resemble that of a kryptonian and as such would potentially make her capable of all the same feats they possess under the yellow sun the abilities she has used thus far are vast possibly limitless superhuman strength speed and durability invulnerability flight normal and interstellar freeze breath and heat vision the powersuit protects her from the harmful effects of kryptonite and grants her the ability to steal the life of someone nearby to resurrect herself any other non kryptonian abilities the suit may possess have yet to be revealed due to the launch of the new 52 it is unlikely that any of the suit s other powers will be revealed unless it makes an appearance in the new continuity as a result of her resurrection in supergirl 50 she is said to have all the inherent abilities and weaknesses of those alien races which were duplicated by the suit as the result of her return from the dead while the exact number of alien races whose powers are duplicated by the suit are unknown kryptonian powers are among the powerset as she displayed the ability to use heat vision shortly after her recovery by sam lane s forces when she was reborn she confirms that she possesses super hearing when she murders a scientist working for lane though she does so with some form of energy blast from her hand a power that is not among the abilities of a kryptonian if this statement is accurate lucy lane now shares the inherent weakness to kryptonite which all kryptonians possess the original suit was destroyed by supergirl but she appears to have acquired another as of supergirl 50 and it is unknown if this suit is the same as the one she had been using to masquerade as a kryptonian or a non magical one after her mutation due to drugs created from an alien fungus lucy can transform from her mutated form to her normal form in her mutated form lucy can fly and apparently withstand tranquilizer darts citation needed in other media edit television edit a young version of lucy lane appears in the prologue of monkey fun an episode of

dots would appear which were then interpreted british museum geomancy greek γεωμαντεία earth divination is a method of divination that interprets markings on the ground or the patterns formed by tossed handfuls of soil rocks or sand the most prevalent form of divinatory geomancy involves interpreting a series of 16 figures formed by a randomized process that involves recursion followed by analyzing them often augmented with astrological interpretations geomancy was practiced by people from all social classes it was one of the most popular forms of divination throughout africa and europe particularly during the middle ages and the renaissance in renaissance magic geomancy was classified as one of the seven forbidden arts along with necromancy hydromancy aeromancy pyromancy chiromancy palmistry and spatulamancy scapulimancy 1 contents 1 history 2 generating the geomantic charts 3 interpreting the charts 4 geomancy and mathematics 5 other forms of geomancy 6 in fantasy literature 7 see also 8 references 9 external links history edit the sixteen geomantic figures the word geomancy from late greek geōmanteía 2 translates literally to foresight by earth it is a calque translation of the arabic term ilm al raml or the science of the sand earlier greek renditions of this word borrowed the arabic word raml sand directly rendering it as rhamplion or rabolion other arabic names for geomancy include khatt al raml and darb al raml 3 14 15 the original names of the figures in middle eastern geomancy were traditionally given in arabic excluding a persian origin the reference in hermetic texts to the mythical ṭumṭum al hindi potentially points to an indian origin although stephen skinner 3 17 thinks this unlikely having an islamic or arabic origin is most likely since the expansive trade routes of arabian merchants when would facilitate the exchange of culture and knowledge 4 european scholars and universities began to translate arabic texts and treatises in the early middle ages including those on geomancy isidore of seville c 560 636 lists geomancy with other methods of divination including pyromancy hydromancy aeromancy and necromancy without describing its application or methods 3 88 it could be that isidore of seville was listing methods of elemental scrying more than what is commonly known as geomancy the poem experimentarius attributed to bernardus silvestris who wrote in the middle of the 12th century was a verse translation of a work on astrological geomancy one of the first discourses on geomancy translated into latin was the ars geomantiae of hugh of santalla fl early 12th century by this point geomancy must have been an established divination system in arabic speaking areas of africa and the middle east citation needed other translators such as gerard of cremona c 1114 1187 also produced new translations on geomancy that incorporated astrological elements and techniques that were up until this point ignored by whom 3 94 97 from this point on more european scholars studied and applied geomancy writing many treatises in the process henry cornelius agrippa 1486 1535 christopher cattan la géomancie du seigneur christofe de cattan 1558 and john heydon 1629 c 1667 produced oft cited and well studied treatises on geomancy along with other philosophers occultists and theologians until the 17th century when interest in occultism and divination began to dwindle due to the rise of the scientific revolution and the age of reason geomancy underwent a revival in the 19th century when renewed interest in the occult arose due to the works of robert thomas cross 1850 1923 and of edward bulwer lytton 1803 1873 franz hartmann published his text the principles of astrological geomancy 5 english translation 1889 which spurred new interest in the divination system based on this and a few older texts the hermetic order of the golden dawn founded in 1887 began the task of recollecting knowledge on geomancy along with other occult subjects with them aleister crowley 1875 1947 published his works that integrated various occult systems of knowledge however due to the short time the members of the golden dawn desired to learn practice and teach the old occult arts many elaborate systems of divination and ritual had to be compressed losing much in the process in effect they had reduced geomancy from a complex art of interpretation and skill in recognizing patterns to looking up predefined answers based on pairs of figures 6 like other systems of divination geomancy has mythological associations according to one arabic hermetic text 7 idris or hermes trismegistus witnessed the angel jibril in a dream idris asked for enlightenment and jibril proceeded to draw a geomantic figure upon being asked what he was doing jibril instructed idris in the geomantic arts keeping this secret he sought out ṭumṭum al hindi an indian king who then wrote a book on geomancy this book was passed down through clandestine circles into the hands of khalaf al barbarĩ who traveled to medina and was converted to islam by the prophet muhammad himself confessing to knowing a divinatory art he explained that pre islamic prophets knew geomancy and that by learning geomancy one may know all that the prophet knew another mythological story for the origin of geomancy also involves idris 8 after praying to god that he give idris easily a means to earn his living idris rested one day bored and without work and began to draw figures idly in the sand as he did so a stranger appeared before him and questioned what he was doing idris replied that he was simply entertaining himself but the stranger replied that he was doing a very serious act idris became incredulous and tried to deny this but the stranger explained the significance of the meaning of the figure idris drew he then commanded idris to draw another figure and upon doing so the stranger explained the meaning and significance of that figure the pair continued this until idris had discovered and understood the sixteen figures the stranger then taught idris how to form the figures in a regular manner and what the results meant teaching him how to know things that could not be known with just the physical senses after testing idris newfound knowledge and skill of geomancy and revealing himself to be the angel jibril in the process the stranger disappeared idris thankful to god and his messenger that he had learned this art never revealed the art to anyone before he was risen to god he wrote a book describing the art as jibril had taught him and from his successors other tablets and records from antiquity identify idris with the prophets daniel citation needed or with enoch this was done in order to give geomancy a legitimate standing as a gift and skill from god especially since one of the prophets had practiced it however those who argued against geomancy such as ibn khaldun in his muqaddima 1377 countered that it was a pre islamic system of knowledge and that all such epistemologies were rendered obsolete with the revelation of the qur an 7 throughout the evolution and migration of geomancy various tales and plays incorporated aspects of the art into their stories in one story in one thousand and one nights both the african magician and his brother use geomancy to find aladdin in order to do him harm geomancy s first mention in print came when in william langland s piers plowman where it is unfavorably compared to the level of expertise a person needs for astronomy gemensye geomesye is gynful of speche in 1386 chaucer used the parson s tale to poke fun at geomancy in canterbury tales what say we of them that believe in divynailes as geomancie shakespeare and ben jonson were also known to use geomancy for comic relief dante alighieri s divine comedy early 14th century makes a passing reference to geomancy in the first two stanzas of canto xix in the purgatorio it was the hour when the diurnal heat no more can warm the coldness of the moon vanquished by earth or peradventure saturn when geomancers their fortuna major see in the orient before the dawn rise by a path that long remains not dim dante aligheri referencing the greater fortune fortuna major and the way the path generating the geomantic charts edit a shield chart the mothers are right to left via acquisitio conjunctio and laetitia while the reconciler is not pictured it would be amissio in this case geomancy requires the geomancer to create sixteen lines of points or marks without counting creating sixteen random numbers without taking note of the number of points made the geomancer provides the seemingly random mechanism needed for most forms of divination once the lines are produced the geomancer marks off the points two by two until either one or two points remain in the line mathematically this is the same as producing two dots if the number is even or one dot if the number is odd taking these leftover points in groups of four they form the first four geomantic figures and form the basis for the generation of the remaining figures once this is done the inspired 9 portion of the geomantic reading is done what remains is algorithmic calculation traditionally geomancy requires a surface of sand and the hands or a stick but can be done equally well with a wax tablet and stylus or a pen and paper ritualized objects may or may not be desired for use in divination often when drawing marks or figures geomancers will proceed from right to left as a tradition from geomancy s arabic origins although this is by no means mandatory modern methods of geomancy include in addition to the traditional ways computerized random number generators or thrown objects other methods including counting the eyes on potatoes 10 some practitioners use specialized cards with each card representing a single geomantic figure in this case only four cards are drawn after shuffling specialized machines have also been used to generate full geomantic charts 11 the figures are entered into a specialized table known as the shield chart which illustrates the recursive processes reminiscent of the cantor set 4 that form the figures the first four figures are called the matres or mothers and form the basis for the rest of the figures in the chart they occupy the first four houses in the upper right hand corner such that the first mother is to the far right the second mother is to her left and so on continuing the right to left tradition the next four figures the filiae or daughters are formed by rearranging the lines used in the mothers the first daughter is formed by taking the first line from the first second third and fourth mothers in order and rearranging them to be the first daughter s first second third and fourth lines respectively the process is done similarly for the second daughter using the second line from the mothers and so on the daughters are placed in the next four houses in order on the same row as the mothers after the eight matres and filiae are formed the four nepotes or nieces are formed by adding those pairs of figures that rest above the houses of the respective niece therefore the first and second mothers add to form the first niece the third and fourth mothers add to form the second niece and so on here addition involves summing the points in the respective lines of the parents if the sum is an even number then the resulting figure s line will have two points and if the sum is odd then the line will have one point conceptually this is the same procedure in mathematical logic as the exclusive or where a line with two points is used instead of false and a line with one point instead of true 12 from the four nepotes the two testes or witnesses are formed in the same manner as the nepotes the first and second nieces form the right witness and the third and fourth nieces form the left witness from the witnesses using the same addition process the iudex or judge is formed a sixteenth figure the reconciler or superiudex is also generated by adding the judge and the first mother although this has become seen as extraneous and a backup figure in recent times interpreting the charts edit see also geomantic figures the shield chart most likely provided an early visual guide to generating the figures and the interpreted answer would center on the fifteenth and sixteenth figures the judge and reconciler skilled geomancers observe the whole chart interpreting among other things meanings of the figures based on where they place in the chart the numerical significance of the total points and the similarities produced by added figures generally the judge represents the answer to the question the right witness describes the querent s side of the query the left witness represents the quesited s side and the reconciler represents the effect of the outcome or judge upon the querent the skilled geomancer can deduce root causes to the situation hidden influences the outcome and its aftermath and general trends and events in the querent s life through interpreting the chart one division of the shield chart for interpretation involves triplets of the figures called triplicities 13 each triplicity contains two of the mothers or two of the daughters and the niece that results from them they can be interpreted in a manner similar to the witnesses and judge in that the right parent represents the past the child the present and the left parent the future another way to interpret such a triplet views the right parent as the querent s side allies resources and opinions the left parent as the quesited s side and the child as the interaction of the two sides triplicity figures involved interpretation first triplicity first mother second mother first niece the querent s health disposition outlooks and habits current trends in the querent s life second triplicity third mother fourth mother second niece the influences in the querent s life at the time of the reading factors that shape the querent s life and the situation surrounding the query third triplicity first daughter second daughter third niece the places most frequented by the querent including the home and the workplace people and objects found at those places family partners and housemates of the querent fourth triplicity third daughter fourth daughter fourth niece friends associates coworkers colleagues of the querent as well as people in authority over the querent situations and factors caused by external sources another method of evaluating a geomantic chart involves taking the total sum of all points from 16 figures within the shield chart in order to evaluate how quickly the queried situation would resolve pietro d abano suggested that the total sum be compared to the sum of all points in the sixteen geomantic figures which is 96 14 if the sum of the chart is 96 then the resolution of the query will be swift and neither slow nor doubtful in other words that all things that could be acted upon in the situation described by the query would resolve without delay nor ahead of schedule if the sum is less than 96 then it will resolve quickly and in a degree proportional to the difference between 96 and the total conversely if the sum is more than 96 then it will resolve slowly the house chart corresponding to the shield chart above the witnesses judge and reconciler are not shown european geomancers provided an alternate method of interpreting the figures through the house chart which feature the twelve astrological houses here they assign the figures from the shield chart to the houses in the house chart the order used differs between different circles of occultists while european geomancers still used the shield chart to generate the figures and provide most answers they augmented geomancy with astrological techniques in the house chart based upon the query they could provide a deeper insight into the querent s life factors shaping the query itself and the extent of the situations involved they took note when several houses shared the same figure as this figure passes from one house to the next it generally indicates that the same situation or event affects each of those houses 15 pietro d abano discusses the primary modes of perfection used in geomantic interpretations with significators in his geomancy essay 14 in astrological geomancy the significators are chosen based upon the identity of the querent and the identity of the quesited generally except when the querent asks about a situation about a subject with no immediate connection to themselves the querent s significator is located in the first house see derivative house the quesited s significator is identified based upon the focus of the query this is based upon the relation of the query to the astrological houses some questions require more than two significators such as in a query involving several primary factors e g two parties quarrelling over an estate queries that have a yes or no or possible impossible answer can easily be answered with these modes of perfection if the chart perfects the answer is yes otherwise in the case of denial of perfection no the nature of the figures themselves should also be considered if a chart perfects with negative figures for instance the matter will resolve but the querent may not like the result on the other hand if the chart does not perfect but the figures are good then the matter will not resolve even though the querent can make do successfully without it mode of perfection interaction of the figures interpretation occupation the querent s significator and the quesited s significator are the same figure a natural connection between querent and quesited the matter will resolve by the querent s own nature without extra effort conjunction one of the significators moves to a house directly beside the house of the other significator the querent and quesited meet each other the significator that moves shows which party must work to attain the resolution if the querent s significator moves to the quesited s then the querent will need to work for the resolution otherwise the quesited will work things out without need from the querent mutation the two significators appear next to each other elsewhere in the chart the resolution will come by some unexpected or unusual manner try new avenues that wouldn t normally be expected translation the same figure appears in houses directly beside the houses of the significators the resolution will come through a third party a mediator will help bridge the gap between the querent and quesited denial no connection exists between the two significators the lack of perfection in a chart the querent and quesited cannot reach each other no resolution in addition to modes of perfection geomancers often took note of aspects between those figures that passed to other houses and especially ones that made aspects to the significators often when a chart denied perfection geomancers would observe how the significators aspected each other the aspects here retain similar meanings from astrology christopher cattan advocates using the strength of the astrological houses in determining the resolution 15 by observing the nature of the figures good or ill depending on the query and what type of house they fall in angular succedent or cadent he judges the total effect of the figures on the query the figures that fall in cadent houses have little to no effect those that fall in succedent houses have a transient effect and those that fall in angular houses have the strongest and most lasting effect upon the query other examples of astrological technique used in geomancy include assigning zodiacal rulerships to the geomantic figures linking geomantic figures to parts of the body based on zodiacal rulers and assigning planetary spirits intelligences and genii to the figures based on their ruling planets geomancy and mathematics edit the four binary elements of each figure allow for 16 different combinations each called a tableau as each chart is generated from the four mothers there are a total number of 164 or 65 536 possible charts due to the mathematics of the chart only figures that have an even number of points total can become judges 12 each of the eight judges then has 8 192 charts associated with it traditional practitioners of geomancy use this knowledge as a type of parity check on the chart to ensure that no mistakes have been made while computing the figures in each chart if all sixteen figures are observed the four mothers the four daughters the four nieces the witnesses judge and reconciler at least two of the figures must be the same as the reconciler is usually termed an optional figure 16 combinations of mother figures can yield a chart where the mothers daughters nieces witnesses and judge are all unique populus cannot appear in these charts since mathematically it either requires two figures to be the same in order to be formed or produces a duplicate figure when added to another figure in such charts the judge will always be one of conjunctio amissio carcer or acquisitio the sixteen combinations of mothers in order from the first to the fourth mother are puer caput draconis tristitia albus

other forms of geomancy edit the arabic tradition consists of sketching sixteen random lines of dots in sand this same process survived virtually unchanged through its introduction to europe in the medieval era and survives to this day in various arabic countries sikidy and other forms of african divination also follow techniques that have remained virtually unchanged in africa one traditional form of geomancy consists of throwing handfuls of dirt in the air and observing how the dirt falls it can also involve a mouse as the agent of the earth spirit ifá one of the oldest forms of geomancy originated in west africa and uses the same sixteen geomantic figures as in arabic and western geomancy with different meanings and names the process is shortened to using only two figures in china the diviner may enter a trance and make markings on the ground that are interpreted by an associate often a young or illiterate boy similar forms of geomancy include scrying involving the patterns seen in rocks or soil the eight trigrams used in i ching the chinese divination practice of the i ching has several striking similarities to geomancy it includes a series of binary trigrams as opposed to tetragrams used in geomancy that are generated at random the resulting figures of which are taken in combination however the figures are not added or reorganized as in geomancy but are instead taken to form a single hexagram while there are 23 or eight trigrams there are 26 or 64 hexagrams this yields a smaller set of resulting charts than geomancy vastu shastra is a traditional indian system of architecture 16 which literally translates to science of architecture 17 these are texts found on the indian subcontinent that describe principles of design layout measurements ground preparation space arrangement and spatial geometry 18 19 vastu shastras incorporate traditional hindu and in some cases buddhist beliefs 20 the designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature the relative functions of various parts of the structure and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns yantra symmetry and directional alignments 21 22 vastu shastra are the textual part of vastu vidya the latter being the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient india 23 vastu vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts with or without the support of layout diagrams that are not rigid rather these ideas and concepts are models for the organization of space and form within a building or collection of buildings based on their functions in relation to each other their usage and to the overall fabric of the vastu 23 ancient vastu shastra principles include those for the design of mandir hindu temples 24 and the principles for the design and layout of houses towns cities gardens roads water works shops and other public areas 19 25 26 kumalak is a type of geomancy practiced in kazakhstan tuva and other parts of central asia kumalak makes use of a three by three grid wherein a shaman will ritually place up to 41 beads these shamans use kumalak more to connect with their ancestors and spiritual guides than to obtain information through divination further shamans who use kumalak must be initiated and taught how to perform the rituals of kumalak correctly according to them kumalak is an ancient system of knowledge reaching back to the roots of their civilization in korea this tradition was popularized in the ninth century by the buddhist monk toson doseon in korea geomancy takes the form of interpreting the topography of the land to determine future events and or the strength of a dynasty or particular family therefore not only were location and land forms important but the topography could shift causing disfavor and the need to relocate the idea is still accepted in many south east asian societies today although with reduced force 27 in the 19th century christian missionaries in china translated feng shui as geomancy due to their observations of local shamans and priests manipulating the flow and direction of energy based on aesthetics location and position of objects and buildings although it stems from a distinct tradition the term geomancy now commonly includes feng shui similarly the introduction of a similar indian system of aesthetics and positioning to harmonize the local energies vastu shastra has come under the name geomancy due to the definition having changed over time along with the recognized definition of the suffix mancy geomancy can cover any spiritual metaphysical or pseudoscientific practice that is related to the earth in recent times the term has been applied to a wide range of other occult and fringe activities including earth mysteries and the introduction of

cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction siegel aspired to become a writer and shuster aspired to become an illustrator siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories which he self published as a magazine called science fiction the advance guard of future civilization his friend shuster often provided illustrations for his work 3 in january 1933 siegel published a short story in his magazine titled the reign of the superman the titular character is a homeless man named bill dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug the drug gives dunn the powers of mind reading mind control and clairvoyance he uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement but then the drug wears off leaving him a powerless vagrant again shuster provided illustrations depicting dunn as a bald man 4 the reign of the superman a short story by jerry siegel january 1933 siegel and shuster shifted to making comic strips with a focus on adventure and comedy they wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors however the newspaper editors told them that their ideas were insufficiently sensational if they wanted to make a successful comic strip it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market this prompted siegel to revisit superman as a comic strip character 5 6 siegel modified superman s powers to make him even more sensational like bill dunn the second prototype of superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist but instead of psychic abilities he acquires superhuman strength and bullet proof skin 7 8 additionally this new superman was a crime fighting hero instead of a villain because siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful 9 in later years siegel once recalled that this superman wore a bat like cape in some panels but typically he and shuster agreed there was no costume yet and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork 10 11 siegel and shuster showed this second concept of superman to consolidated book publishers based in chicago 12 a in may 1933 consolidated had published a proto comic book titled detective dan secret operative 48 13 it contained all original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips which was a novelty at the time 14 siegel and shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called the superman a delegation from consolidated visited cleveland that summer on a business trip and siegel and shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person 15 16 although consolidated expressed interest they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of detective dan were disappointing 17 18 cover of an unpublished comic book 1933 siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and shuster were young and unknown so he looked for an established artist to replace shuster 19 when siegel told shuster what he was doing shuster reacted by burning their rejected superman comic sparing only the cover they continued collaborating on other projects but for the time being shuster was through with superman 20 siegel wrote to numerous artists 19 the first response came in july 1933 from leo o mealia who drew the fu manchu strip for the bell syndicate 21 22 in the script that siegel sent to o mealia superman s origin story changes he is a scientist adventurer from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved superpowers just before the earth explodes he escapes in a time machine to the modern era whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime 23 o mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate but they were rejected o mealia did not send to siegel any copies of his strips and they have been lost 24 in june 1934 siegel found another partner an artist in chicago named russell keaton 25 26 keaton drew the buck rogers and skyroads comic strips in the script that siegel sent keaton in june superman s origin story further evolved in the distant future when earth is on the verge of exploding due to giant cataclysms the last surviving man sends his three year old son back in time to the year 1935 the time machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists sam and molly kent they leave the boy in an orphanage but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin the kents adopt the boy and name him clark and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity in november siegel sent keaton an extension of his script an adventure where superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player the extended script mentions that clark puts on a special uniform when assuming the identity of superman but it is not described 27 keaton produced two weeks worth of strips based on siegel s script in november keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate but they too were rejected and he abandoned the project 28 29 siegel and shuster reconciled and resumed developing superman together the character became an alien from the planet krypton shuster designed the now familiar costume tights with an s on the chest over shorts and a cape 30 31 32 they made clark kent a journalist who pretends to be timid and conceived his colleague lois lane who is attracted to the bold and mighty superman but does not realize that he and kent are the same person 33 concept art c 1934 1935 note the laced sandals based on those of strongmen and classical heroes 34 in june 1935 siegel and shuster finally found work with national allied publications a comic magazine publishing company in new york owned by malcolm wheeler nicholson 35 wheeler nicholson published two of their strips in new fun comics 6 1935 henri duval and doctor occult 36 siegel and shuster also showed him superman and asked him to market superman to the newspapers on their behalf 37 in october wheeler nicholson offered to publish superman in one of his own magazines 38 siegel and shuster refused his offer because wheeler nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman he had been slow to respond to their letters and hadn t paid them for their work in new fun comics 6 they chose to keep marketing superman to newspaper syndicates themselves 39 40 despite the erratic pay siegel and shuster kept working for wheeler nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines 41 wheeler nicholson s financial difficulties continued to mount in 1936 he formed a joint corporation with harry donenfeld and jack liebowitz called detective comics inc in order to release his third magazine which was titled detective comics siegel and shuster produced stories for detective comics too such as slam bradley wheeler nicholson fell into deep debt to donenfeld and liebowitz and in early january 1938 donenfeld and liebowitz petitioned wheeler nicholson s company into bankruptcy and seized it 3 42 in early december 1937 siegel visited liebowitz in new york and liebowitz asked siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called action comics 43 44 siegel proposed some new stories but not superman siegel and shuster were at the time negotiating a deal with the mcclure newspaper syndicate for superman in early january 1938 siegel had a three way telephone conversation with liebowitz and an employee of mcclure named max gaines gaines informed siegel that mcclure had rejected superman and asked if he could forward their superman strips to liebowitz so that liebowitz could consider them for action comics siegel agreed 45 liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips and they asked siegel and shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for action comics 46 having grown tired of rejections siegel and shuster accepted the offer at least now they would see superman published 47 48 siegel and shuster submitted their work in late february and were paid 130 equivalent to 2 503 in 2021 for their work 10 per page 49 in early march they signed a contract at liebowitz s request in which they gave away the copyright for superman to detective comics inc this was normal practice in the business and siegel and shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well 50 see the copyright issues section of this article for more details on this matter the duo s revised version of superman appeared in the first issue of action comics which was published on april 18 1938 the issue was a huge success thanks to superman s feature 1 51 52 influences siegel and shuster read pulp science fiction and adventure magazines and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy clairvoyance and superhuman strength one character in particular was john carter of mars from the novels by edgar rice burroughs john carter is a human who is transported to mars where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances 53 54 another influence was philip wylie s 1930 novel gladiator featuring a protagonist named hugo danner who had similar powers 55 56 superman s stance and devil may care attitude were influenced by the characters of douglas fairbanks who starred in adventure films such as the mark of zorro and robin hood 57 the name of superman s home city metropolis was taken from the 1927 film of the same name 58 popeye cartoons were also an influence 58 the name clark kent was created by taking the first names of actors clark gable and kent taylor clark was also inspired by explorer william clark especially when coming up with the names lois and clark a nod to meriwether lewis and william clark american explorers who discovered the pacific ocean douglas fairbanks left and harold lloyd right influenced the look of superman and clark kent respectively clark kent s harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as don diego de la vega in the mark of zorro and sir percy blakeney in the scarlet pimpernel siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor 59 60 another inspiration was slapstick comedian harold lloyd the archetypal lloyd character was a mild mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously 61 kent is a journalist because siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school the love triangle between lois lane clark and superman was inspired by siegel s own awkwardness with girls 62 the pair collected comic strips in their youth with a favorite being winsor mccay s fantastical little nemo 58 shuster remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style alex raymond and burne hogarth were my idols also milt caniff hal foster and roy crane 58 shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected 3 as a boy shuster was interested in fitness culture 63 and a fan of strongmen such as siegmund breitbart and joseph greenstein he collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art 3 the visual design of superman came from multiple influences the tight fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers boxers and strongmen in early concept art shuster gave superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes but these were eventually changed to red boots 34 the costumes of douglas fairbanks were also an influence 64 the emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests 65 many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes superman s face was based on johnny weissmuller with touches derived from the comic strip character dick tracy and from the work of cartoonist roy crane 66 the word superman was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability most often athletes and politicians 67 it occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well such as the superman of dr jukes 68 it is unclear whether siegel and shuster were influenced by friedrich nietzsche s concept of the übermensch they never acknowledged as much 69 comics see also publication history of superman and superman franchise comic books see also list of superman comics the cover of superman 6 sept 1940 by joe shuster the original artist and co creator since 1938 superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by dc comics the first and oldest of these is action comics which began in april 1938 1 action comics was initially an anthology magazine but it eventually became dedicated to superman stories the second oldest periodical is superman which began in june 1939 action comics and superman have been published without interruption ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme 71 72 a number of other shorter lived superman periodicals have been published over the years 73 superman is part of the dc universe which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by dc comics and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of batman wonder woman and others superman has sold more comic books over his publication history than any other american superhero character 74 exact sales figures for the early decades of superman comic books are hard to find because like most publishers at the time dc comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public as well but given the general market trends at the time sales of action comics and superman probably peaked in the mid 1940s and thereafter steadily declined 75 sales data first became public in 1960 and showed that superman was the best selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s 2 76 77 sales rose again starting in 1987 superman 75 nov 1992 sold over 23 million copies 78 making it the best selling issue of a comic book of all time thanks to a media sensation over the supposedly permanent death of the character in that issue 79 sales declined from that point on in march 2018 action comics sold just 51 534 copies although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general for comparison amazing spider man 797 sold only 128 189 copies 80 the comic books are today considered a niche aspect of the superman franchise due to low readership 81 though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation 82 whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult 83 a major reason for this shift was dc comics decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers supermarkets newsstands etc a model called direct distribution this made comic books less accessible to children 84 newspaper strips see also superman comic strip beginning in january 1939 a superman daily comic strip appeared in newspapers syndicated through the mcclure syndicate a color sunday version was added that november jerry siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted in 1943 the sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips possibly because siegel had to delegate the sunday strips to ghostwriters 85 by 1941 the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million 86 joe shuster drew the early strips then passed the job to wayne boring 87 from 1949 to 1956 the newspaper strips were drawn by win mortimer 88 the strip ended in may 1966 but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by warner bros 89 editors initially siegel was allowed to write superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise 90 91 but soon siegel and shuster s work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors 92 siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories 93 editor whitney ellsworth hired in 1940 dictated that superman not kill 94 sexuality was banned and colorfully outlandish villains such as ultra humanite and toyman were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers 95 mort weisinger was the editor on superman comics from 1941 to 1970 his tenure briefly interrupted by military service siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology but as the number of superman titles and the pool of writers grew weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach 96 weisinger assigned story ideas and the logic of superman s powers his origin the locales and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned elements such as bizarro his cousin supergirl the phantom zone the fortress of solitude alternate varieties of kryptonite robot doppelgangers and krypto were introduced during this era the complicated universe built under weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals 97 weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama and avoided sensitive subjects such as the vietnam war and the american civil rights movement because he feared his right wing views would alienate his left leaning writers and readers 98 weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers 99 weisinger retired in 1970 and julius schwartz took over by his own admission weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers 100 schwartz updated superman by making clark kent a television anchor and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers 101 schwartz also scaled superman s powers down to a level closer to siegel s original these changes would eventually be reversed by later writers schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as for the man who has everything superman annual 11 in which the villain mongul torments superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living krypton schwartz retired from dc comics in 1986 and was succeeded by mike carlin as an editor on superman comics his retirement coincided with dc comics decision to reboot the dc universe with the companywide crossover storyline crisis on infinite earths writer john byrne rewrote the superman mythos again reducing superman s powers which writers had slowly re strengthened and revised many supporting characters such as making lex luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist and making supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because dc wanted superman to be the sole surviving kryptonian carlin was promoted to executive editor for the dc universe books in 1996 a position he held until 2002 k c carlson took his place as editor of the superman comics aesthetic style in the earlier decades of superman comics artists were expected to conform to a certain house style 102 joe shuster defined the aesthetic style of superman in the 1940s after shuster left national wayne boring succeeded him as the principal artist on superman comic books 103 he redrew superman taller and more detailed 104 around 1955 curt swan in turn succeeded boring 105 the 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single house style in superman comics 106 in other media main article superman franchise radio the first adaptation of superman beyond

slam bradley doctor occult etc 50 but superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away 134 dc comics retained siegel and shuster and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers 135 between 1938 and 1947 dc comics paid them together at least 401 194 85 equivalent to 6 510 000 in 2021 136 137 siegel wrote most of the magazine and daily newspaper stories until he was conscripted into the army in 1943 whereupon the task was passed to ghostwriters 138 139 while siegel was serving in hawaii dc comics published a story featuring a child version of superman called superboy which was based on a script siegel had submitted several years before siegel was furious because dc comics did this without having bought the character 140 after siegel s discharge from the army he and shuster sued dc comics in 1947 for the rights to superman and superboy the judge ruled that superman belonged to dc comics but that superboy was a separate entity that belonged to siegel siegel and shuster settled out of court with dc comics which paid the pair 94 013 16 equivalent to 1 060 317 in 2021 in exchange for the full rights to both superman and superboy 141 dc comics then fired siegel and shuster 142 dc comics rehired jerry siegel as a writer in 1959 in 1965 siegel and shuster attempted to regain rights to superman using the renewal option in the copyright act of 1909 but the court ruled siegel and shuster had transferred the renewal rights to dc comics in 1938 siegel and shuster appealed but the appeals court upheld this decision dc comics fired siegel when he filed this second lawsuit 143 in 1975 siegel and a number of other comic book writers and artists launched a public campaign for better compensation and treatment of comic creators warner brothers agreed to give siegel and shuster a yearly stipend full medical benefits and credit their names in all future superman productions in exchange for never contesting ownership of superman siegel and shuster upheld this bargain 3 shuster died in 1992 dc comics offered shuster s heirs a stipend in exchange for never challenging ownership of superman which they accepted for some years 141 siegel died in 1996 his heirs attempted to take the rights to superman using the termination provision of the copyright act of 1976 dc comics negotiated an agreement wherein it would pay the siegel heirs several million dollars and a yearly stipend of 500 000 in exchange for permanently granting dc the rights to superman dc comics also agreed to insert the line by special arrangement with the jerry siegel family in all future superman productions 144 the siegels accepted dc s offer in an october 2001 letter 141 copyright lawyer and movie producer marc toberoff then struck a deal with the heirs of both siegel and shuster to help them get the rights to superman in exchange for signing the rights over to his production company pacific pictures both groups accepted the siegel heirs called off their deal with dc comics and in 2004 sued dc for the rights to superman and superboy in 2008 the judge ruled in favor of the siegels dc comics appealed the decision and the appeals court ruled in favor of dc arguing that the october 2001 letter was binding in 2003 the shuster heirs served a termination notice for shuster s grant of his half of the copyright to superman dc comics sued the shuster heirs in 2010 and the court ruled in dc s favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant 141 under current us copyright law superman is due to enter the public domain in 2033 145 c however this will only apply at first to the character as he is depicted in action comics 1 which was published in 1938 versions of him with later developments such as his power of heat vision may persist under copyright until the works they were introduced in enter the public domain themselves 146 lois lane who also debuted in action comics 1 is expected to enter public domain as well in 2033 but supporting characters introduced in later publications such as jimmy olsen and supergirl will pass into the public domain at later dates captain marvel see also national comics publications v fawcett publications superman s success immediately begat a wave of imitations the most successful of these at this early age was captain marvel first published by fawcett comics in december 1939 captain marvel had many similarities to superman herculean strength invulnerability the ability to fly a cape a secret identity and a job as a journalist dc comics filed a lawsuit against fawcett comics for copyright infringement citation needed the trial began in march 1948 after seven years of discovery the judge ruled that fawcett had indeed infringed on superman however the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the copyright act of 1909 and were therefore invalid furthermore since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from action comics the judge ruled that dc comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the action comics stories and superman and therefore forfeited its right to sue fawcett for copyright infringement 141 dc comics appealed this decision the appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights furthermore fawcett knew that dc comics never intended to abandon the copyrights and therefore fawcett s infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding and therefore fawcett owed damages to dc comics d the appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much fawcett owed in damages 141 at that point fawcett comics decided to settle out of court with dc comics fawcett paid dc comics 400 000 equivalent to 4 051 244 in 2021 and agreed to stop publishing captain marvel the last captain marvel story from fawcett comics was published in september 1953 147 dc comics licensed captain marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with superman by 1991 dc comics had purchased fawcett comics and with it the full rights to captain marvel dc eventually renamed the character shazam to prevent disputes with marvel comics who had created a character of their own named captain marvel back when the fawcett character had lingered in limbo 148 character overview this section details the most consistent elements of the superman narrative in the myriad stories published since 1938 superman himself in action comics 1 1938 superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans shortly after he is born his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm but superman s scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to earth in a small spaceship the ship is too small to carry anyone else so superman s parents stay behind and die the earliest newspaper strips name the planet krypton the baby kal l and his biological parents jor l and lora 149 their names were changed to jor el and lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by george lowther 150 the ship lands in the american countryside where the baby is discovered by the kents a farming couple the kents name the boy clark and raise him in a farming community a 1947 episode of the radio serial places this unnamed community in iowa 151 it is named smallville in superboy 2 june 1949 the 1978 superman movie placed it in kansas as have most superman stories since 152 new adventures of superboy 22 oct 1981 places it in maryland in action comics 1 and most stories published before 1986 superman s powers begin developing in infancy from 1944 to 1986 dc comics regularly published stories of superman s childhood and adolescent adventures when he called himself superboy from 1986 on beginning with man of steel 1 superman s powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult the kents teach clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good clark creates the costumed identity of superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones as clark kent he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment s notice to complete this disguise clark avoids violent confrontation preferring to slip away and change into superman when danger arises and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice in superboy 78 1960 superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to earth in in man of steel 1 1986 martha kent makes the costume from human manufactured cloth and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that superman projects the s on superman s chest at first was simply an initial for superman when writing the script for the 1978 movie tom mankiewicz made it superman s kryptonian family crest 153 this was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies such as man of steel in the comic story superman birthright the crest is described as an old kryptonian symbol for hope clark works as a newspaper journalist in the earliest stories he worked for the daily star but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the daily planet in comics from the early 1970s clark worked as a television journalist an attempt to modernize the character however for the 1978 movie the producers chose to make clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most of the public thought of him 154 the first story in which superman dies was published in superman 149 1961 in which he is murdered by lex luthor by means of kryptonite this story was imaginary and thus was ignored in subsequent books in superman 188 april 1966 superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers in the 1990s the death and return of superman story arc after a deadly battle with doomsday superman died in superman 75 jan 1993 he was later revived by the eradicator using kryptonian technology in superman 52 may 2016 superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning and this time he is not resurrected but replaced by the superman of an alternate timeline superman maintains a secret hideout called the fortress of solitude which is located somewhere in the arctic here superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments in action comics 241 the fortress of solitude is a cave in a mountain sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but superman to use in the 1978 movie the fortress of solitude is a structure made out of crystal clark kent clark kent redirects here for other uses see clark kent disambiguation superman s secret identity is clark joseph kent a reporter for the daily planet although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive earth parents everything about clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity as a reporter for the daily planet he receives late breaking news before the general public always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines he sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his superman responsibilities bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy he believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world regardless of who is involved 155 in the bronze age of comic books clark kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in the superman family the private life of clark kent where superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining clark to deflect suspicion that he is superman clark kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms a higher pitched voice and a slight slouch this personality is typically described as mild mannered as in the opening narration of max fleischer s superman animated theatrical shorts these traits extended into clark s wardrobe which typically consists of a bland colored business suit a red necktie black rimmed glasses combed back hair and occasionally a fedora clark wears his superman costume underneath his street clothes allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar s emblem when called into action his hair also changes with the clothing change with superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead superman usually stores his clark kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape 156 though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location such as the daily planet storeroom 157 for later retrieval as superman s alter ego the personality concept and name of clark kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities in 1992 superman co creator joe shuster told the toronto star that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men clark gable and kent taylor but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic harold lloyd and himself 158 clark s middle name is given variously as either joseph jerome or jonathan all being allusions to creators jerry siegel and joe shuster personality in the original siegel and shuster stories superman s personality is rough and aggressive he often uses excessive force and terror against criminals on some occasions even killing them this came to an end in late 1940 when new editor whitney ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow banning superman from ever killing 159 the character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism ellsworth s code however is not to be confused with the comics code which was created in 1954 by the comics code authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century 160 in his first appearances superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities being fired upon by the national guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor by 1942 however superman was working side by side with the police 161 162 today superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind hearted hero with a strong sense of justice morality and righteousness he adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents 163 his commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes but has stirred resentment and criticism among others who refer to him as the big blue boy scout superman can be rather rigid in this trait causing tensions in the superhero community 164 this was most notable with wonder woman one of his closest friends after she killed maxwell lord 164 booster gold initially had an icy relationship with the man of steel but grew to respect him 165 having lost his home world of krypton superman is very protective of earth 166 and especially of clark kent s family and friends this same loss combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly has caused superman to feel lonely on earth despite having his friends and parents previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow kryptonians power girl 167 and mon el 168 have led to disappointment the arrival of supergirl who has been confirmed to be his cousin from krypton relieved this loneliness somewhat 169 superman s fortress of solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair 170 powers abilities and weaknesses the catalog of superman s abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of superman fiction released since 1938 since action comics 1 1938 superman has superhuman strength the cover of action comics 1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head another classic feat of strength on superman s part is breaking steel chains in some stories he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets 171 and crush coal into diamond with his hands since action comics 1 1938 superman has a highly durable body invulnerable for most practical purposes at the very least bullets bounce harmlessly off his body in some stories such as kingdom come not even a nuclear bomb can harm him in the earliest stories superman s costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is which is why it typically doesn t tear up when he does superman feats in later stories beginning with man of steel 1 1986 superman s body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight fitting clothes he wears and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth in action comics 1 superman could not fly he traveled by running and leaping thanks to his superhuman speed which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940 172 superman can fly at great speeds he can break the sound barrier and in some stories he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies superman can project and perceive x rays via his eyes which allows him to see through objects he first uses this power in action comics 11 1939 certain materials such as lead can block his x ray vision superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel he first used this power in superman 59 1949 by applying his x ray vision at its highest intensity in later stories this ability is simply called heat vision superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear and at frequencies outside the human hearing range this ability was introduced in action comics 11 1939 since action comics 20 1940 superman possesses superhuman breath which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects he has a significant focus of his breath s intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them the freeze breath was first demonstrated in superman 129 1959 action comics 1 1938 explained that superman s strength was common to all kryptonians because they were a species millions of years advanced of our own in the first newspaper strips jor el is shown running and leaping like superman and his wife survives a building collapsing on her later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of krypton s higher gravity superman 146 1961 established that superman s abilities other than strength flight durability etc are activated by the light of earth s yellow sun in action comics 300 1963 all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of krypton s sun exposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies superman s powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea prolonged exposure will eventually kill him although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form writers have introduced other forms over the years such as red gold blue white and black each with peculiar effects 173 gold kryptonite for instance nullifies superman s powers but otherwise does not harm him kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial 174 it first appeared in comics in superman 61 dec 1949 175 superman is also vulnerable to magic enchanted weapons and magical spells affect superman as easily as they would a normal human this weakness was established in superman 171 1964 like all kryptonians kal el is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along telekinesis illusion casting mind control etc as shown in wonder woman vol 2 219 sept 2005 a powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of superman to induce strokes or mangle his internals as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the

first and most famous supporting character is lois lane introduced in action comics 1 she is a fellow journalist at the daily planet as jerry siegel conceived her lois considers clark kent to be a wimp but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty superman not knowing that kent and superman are the same person siegel objected to any proposal that lois discover that clark is superman because he felt that as implausible as clark s disguise is the love triangle was too important to the book s appeal 176 however siegel wrote stories in which lois suspects clark is superman and tries to prove it with superman always duping her in the end the first such story was in superman 17 july august 1942 177 178 this was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s in a story in action comics 484 june 1978 clark kent admits to lois that he is superman and they marry this was the first story in which superman and lois marry that wasn t an imaginary tale many superman stories since then have depicted superman and lois as a married couple but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle in modern era comic books superman and lois are a stable married couple and the superman supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son jonathan kent other supporting characters include jimmy olsen a photographer at the daily planet who is friends with both superman and clark kent though in most stories he doesn t know that clark is superman jimmy is frequently described as superman s pal and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with superman in the earliest comic book stories clark kent s employer is george taylor of the daily star but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to perry white of the daily planet 179 clark kent s foster parents are ma and pa kent in many stories one or both of them have died by the time clark becomes superman clark s parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life antagonists main article list of superman enemies the villains superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans such as gangsters corrupt politicians and violent husbands but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children the mad scientist ultra humanite introduced in action comics 13 june 1939 was superman s first recurring villain superman s best known nemesis lex luthor was introduced in action comics 23 april 1940 and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman sometimes both 180 in 1944 the magical imp mister mxyzptlk superman s first recurring super powered adversary was introduced 181 superman s first alien villain brainiac debuted in action comics 242 july 1958 the monstrous doomsday introduced in superman the man of steel 17 18 nov dec 1992 was the first villain to evidently kill superman in physical combat without exploiting superman s critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic alternative depictions main article alternative versions of superman see also superman earth two and superman earth one the details superman s story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938 but most versions conform to the basic template described above a few stories feature radically altered versions of superman an example is the graphic novel superman red son which depicts a communist superman who rules the soviet union dc comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes for instance in the 1960s the superman of earth one would occasionally feature in stories alongside the superman of earth two the latter of whom resembled superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s dc comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of superman cultural impact and legacy the superhero archetype superman is often thought of as the first superhero this point can be debated ogon bat the phantom zorro and mandrake the magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate superman nevertheless superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions a costume a codename extraordinary abilities and an altruistic mission superman s success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations which include batman captain america and captain marvel this flourishing is today referred to as america s golden age of comic books which lasted from 1938 to about 1950 the golden age ended when american superhero book sales declined leading to the cancellation of many characters but superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the silver age of comic books when characters such as spider man iron man and the x men were created after world war 2 american superhero fiction entered japanese culture astro boy first published in 1952 was inspired by mighty mouse which in turn was a parody of superman 182 the superman animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on japanese television in 1955 and they were followed in 1956 by the tv show adventures of superman starring george reeves these shows were popular with the japanese and inspired japan s own prolific genre of superheroes the first japanese superhero movie super giant was released in 1957 the first japanese superhero tv show was moonlight mask in 1958 other notable japanese superheroes include ultraman kamen rider and sailor moon 183 184 185 fine art starting with the pop art period and on a continuing basis since the 1960s the character of superman has been appropriated by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork 186 187 most notably by andy warhol 188 189 roy lichtenstein 190 mel ramos 191 dulce pinzon 192 mr brainwash 193 raymond pettibon 194 peter saul 195 giuseppe veneziano 196 f lennox campello 197 and others 193 198 199 literary analysis superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut with umberto eco noting that he can be seen as the representative of all his similars 200 writing in time in 1971 gerald clarke stated superman s enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the horatio alger myth of the self made man clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation he regarded superman s character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world which he saw as a place in which only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper 201 andrew arnold writing in the early 21st century has noted superman s partial role in exploring assimilation the character s alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level a c grayling writing in the spectator traces superman s stances through the decades from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of al capone through the 1940s and world war ii a period in which superman helped sell war bonds 202 and into the 1950s where superman explored the new technological threats grayling notes the period after the cold war as being one where matters become merely personal the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of lex luthor and brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions and discusses events post 9 11 stating that as a nation caught between the terrifying george w bush and the terrorist osama bin laden america is in earnest need of a saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe and here he is the down home clean cut boy in the blue tights and red cape 203 an influence on early superman stories is the context of the great depression superman took on the role of social activist fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run down tenements 204 comics scholar roger sabin sees this as a reflection of the liberal idealism of franklin roosevelt s new deal with shuster and siegel initially portraying superman as champion to a variety of social causes 205 206 in later superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues tackling a version of the ku klux klan in a 1946 broadcast as well as combating anti semitism and veteran discrimination 207 208 209 scott bukatman has discussed superman and the superhero in general noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space especially in superman s ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of metropolis he writes that the character represented in 1938 a kind of corbusierian ideal superman has x ray vision walls become permeable transparent through his benign controlled authority superman renders the city open modernist and democratic he furthers a sense that le corbusier described in 1925 namely that everything is known to us 210 the library of congress hosting a discussion with dan jurgens and paul levitz for superman s 80th anniversary and the 1 000th issue of action comics jules feiffer has argued that superman s real innovation lay in the creation of the clark kent persona noting that what made superman extraordinary was his point of origin clark kent feiffer develops the theme to establish superman s popularity in simple wish fulfillment 211 a point siegel and shuster themselves supported siegel commenting that if you re interested in what made superman what it is here s one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable joe and i had certain inhibitions which led to wish fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip that s where the dual identity concept came from and shuster supporting that as being why so many people could relate to it 212 ian gordon suggests that the many incarnations of superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the american way he defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism consumerism and democracy and as something that took shape around wwii and underpinned the war effort superman he notes was very much part of that effort 213 an allegory for immigrants superman s immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal 214 215 216 aldo regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in america the extraterrestrial origin was seen by regalado as challenging the notion that anglo saxon ancestry was the source of all might 217 gary engle saw the myth of superman asserting with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in american culture he argues that superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities through the use of a dual identity superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures clark kent represents the assimilated individual allowing superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good 215 david jenemann has offered a contrasting view he argues that superman s early stories portray a threat the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country 218 david rooney a theater critic for the new york times in his evaluation of the play year zero considers superman to be the quintessential immigrant story b orn on an alien planet he grows stronger on earth but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm 219 religious themes some believe that superman took inspiration from judaic mythology the british rabbi simcha weinstein notes that superman s story has some parallels to that of moses for example moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and adopted by a foreign culture weinstein also posits that superman s kryptonian name kal el resembles the hebrew words קו ל א ל qōl ʾēl which can be taken to mean voice of god 220 the historian larry tye suggests that this voice of god is an allusion to moses role as a prophet 221 the suffix el meaning god is also found in the name of angels e g gabriel ariel who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers the nazis also thought superman was a jew and in 1940 joseph goebbels publicly denounced superman and his creator jerry siegel 222 all that said historians such as martin lund and les daniels argue that the evidence for judaic influence in siegel s stories is merely circumstantial jerry siegel and joe shuster were not practicing jews and never acknowledged the influence of judaism in any memoir or interview 223 224 superman stories have occasionally exhibited christian themes as well screenwriter tom mankiewicz consciously made superman an allegory for jesus christ in the 1978 movie starring christopher reeve baby kal el s ship resembles the star of bethlehem and jor el gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future 225 this messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie man of steel wherein jor el asks superman to redeem the kryptonian race which corrupted itself through eugenics by guiding humanity down a wiser path 226 see also

against his will by a scientist he gained fantastic strength bullets bounced off him etc he fought crime with the fury of an outraged avenger 50 what i thought could be more sensational than a superman who could fly through the air who was impervious to flames bullets and a mob of enraged amok adversaries siegel in andrae 1983 p 10 obviously having him a hero would be infinitely more commercial than having him a villain i understand that the comic strip dr fu manchu ran into all sorts of difficulties because the main character was a villain and with the example before us of tarzan and other action heroes of fiction who were very successful mainly because people admired them and looked up to them it seemed the sensible thing to do to make the superman a hero the first piece was a short story and that s one thing but creating a successful comic strip with a character you ll hope will continue for many years it would definitely be going in the wrong direction to make him a villain daniels 1998 superman the complete history p 17 usually shuster and siegel agreed that no special costume was in evidence and the surviving artwork bears them out siegel and shuster in andrae

z kalibak edit kalibak ˈkælɪbæk is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books published by dc comics kalibak is the eldest son of darkseid the half brother of orion and grayven and an enemy of superman and the justice league 1 2 created by jack kirby being debuted with the rest of the new gods first appearing in new gods 1 february 1971 in an era called the silver age of comic books he is originally and recurrently depicted as the brutish son of darkseid commonly seeking affection of his father who he had a tragic childhood with he is also depicted as second in command as leader of apokolips and rival to another of darkseid son orion 3 kalibak s name is derived from the william shakespeare character name caliban the half man from the tempest 4 5 6 7 kalibak is the first born son of darkseid and suli his mother suli is killed by desaad acting under orders from kalibak s grandmother queen heggra kalibak becomes a legendary warrior and often serves as darkseid s second in command after darkseid breaks the pact of peace with new genesis the rival planet of kalibak s home apokolips he aids his father in the resulting battles 8 kalibak is often pitted against orion and after numerous clashes they learned that they were half brothers this fuels kalibak s hatred of orion to new levels for darkseid clearly respects orion over his first born unlike orion kalibak secretly craves the love and respect of his father something neither he nor anyone else can ever hope to attain and it has been shown that he has a gentle side which is completely submerged under his brutish exterior and which he consistently and fearfully keeps hidden because on apokolips any sign of weakness is subject to the cruelest punishment for his part darkseid is more lenient towards kalibak s failures than those of his other servants having slain him he always returns him to life it is implied this is because his eldest son is the offspring of the one person darkseid truly loved as well being one of the only few of his followers with genuine loyalty at one point kalibak is desperate enough to confront orion without darkseid s consent kalibak s scheme fell apart and he kills his accomplice desaad also a servant of darkseid to cover his tracks darkseid was not pleased when he found out and reduced his son to a pile of ash after enough time had passed darkseid resurrected kalibak hoping the boy had learned a lesson kalibak later spends some time in an apokolips prison on darkseid s orders in orion 1 june 2000 darkseid is on earth when orion invades apokolips justeen a servant of desaad releases kalibak to battle orion yet again kalibak is swiftly subdued but does not care much as orion leaves to battle darkseid and kalibak hopes to gain power as a result during the universe wide genesis incident apokolips forces including kalibak invade earth in young heroes in love 5 kalibak and his small squad of parademons are defeated by the leader of the young heroes the telekinetic and telepathic hard drive 9 kalibak is slain by his uncle infinity man who has been murdering the residents of apokolips and new genesis as an agent of the source wall in death of the new gods in final crisis the new fifth world and human version of kalibak appears alongside darkseid calling himself dark side seemingly reborn in a new form alongside his father and a human kanto this form is later replaced with a humanoid tiger like form engineered by simyan and mokkari he is seen devouring a green lantern named opto 10 he leads a regiment of tiger soldiers against the heroes in blüdhaven but he is killed in combat with tawky tawny before he dies he begs his soldiers to help they refuse as they only follow the strong they then bow to tawny as kalibak dies in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe kalibak is a loyal follower of darkseid backing him up in a war against the anti monitor he does have a problem with slaying apokolips soldiers that literally get in the way between him and the enemy 11 kalibak possesses high levels of superhuman strength endurance and durability despite his muscular bulk he is surprisingly fast and agile as well 12 like all beings of the fourth world he is immortal kalibak is a highly trained hand to hand combatant known on apokolips for his savagery 13 he is armed with a beta club a weapon that fires force bolts or nerve beams that causes living beings agonizing pain beyond comprehension it is nearly indestructable though orion once destroyed it with some assistance from lightray 14 he can also summon and use aero disks which allow him to fly 12 kalibak also has access to high tech weapons of mass destruction physically kalibak is one of the strongest gods on apokolips and the most loyal to darkseid this is what makes kalibak an indispensable member of darkseid s elite kalibak possesses incredible levels of superhuman strength almost on par with superman orion and even darkseid himself once he had been augmented by his father in an effort to secure the life equation from an elemental wielder darkseid had bestowed his son with vastly augmented might and menace enabling him to physically overpower his once far stronger brother orion in combat even granting him the ability of psi beams which are an omega effect like psionic blast which spike individual minds with blinding amounts of mental agony 15 alternate versions of kalibak edit in the tie in comics to injustice gods among us kalibak travels to earth after superman calls a peace treaty where he attacks him after vanquishing

edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message the waverider design concept was first developed by terence nonweiler of the queen s university of belfast and first described in print in 1951 as a re entry vehicle 3 it consisted of a delta wing platform with a low wing loading to provide considerable surface area to dump the heat of re entry at the time nonweiler was forced to use a greatly simplified 2d model of airflow around the aircraft which he realized would not be accurate due to spanwise flow across the wing however he also noticed that the spanwise flow would be stopped by the shockwave being generated by the aircraft and that if the wing was positioned to deliberately approach the shock the spanwise flow would be trapped under wing increasing pressure and thus increasing lift in the 1950s the british started a space program based around the blue streak missile which was at some point to include a manned vehicle armstrong whitworth were contracted to develop the re entry vehicle and unlike the u s space program they decided to stick with a winged vehicle instead of a ballistic capsule between 1957 and 1959 they contracted nonweiler to develop his concepts further this work produced a pyramid shaped design with a flat underside and short wings heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces where it was dumped into the turbulent air on the top of the wing in 1960 work on the blue streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service work then moved to the royal aircraft establishment rae where it continued as a research program into high speed mach 4 to 7 civilian airliners 4 this work was discovered by engineers at north american aviation during the early design studies of what would lead to the xb 70 bomber they re designed the original classic delta wing to incorporate drooping wing tips in order to trap the shock waves mechanically rather than using a shock cone generated from the front of the aircraft this mechanism also had two other beneficial effects it reduced the amount of horizontal lifting surface at the rear of the aircraft which helped offset a nose down trim that occurs at high speeds and it added more vertical surface which helped improve the directional stability which decreased at high speed citation needed caret wing edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message nonweiler s original design used the shock wave generated by the aircraft as a way to control spanwise flow and thereby increase the amount of air trapped under the wing in the same way as a wing fence while working on these concepts he noticed that it was possible to shape the wing in such a way that the shock wave generated off its leading edge would form a horizontal sheet under the craft in this case the airflow would not only be trapped horizontally spanwise but vertically as well the only area the air above the shock wave could escape would be out the back of the sheet where the fuselage ended since the air was trapped between this sheet and the fuselage a large volume of air would be trapped much more than the more basic approach he first developed furthermore since the shock surface was held at a distance from the craft shock heating was limited to the leading edges of the wings lowering the thermal loads on the fuselage in 1962 nonweiler moved to glasgow university to become professor of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics that year his delta wings of shapes amenable to exact shock wave theory was published by the journal of the royal aeronautical society and earned him that society s gold medal a craft generated using this model looks like a delta wing that has been broken down the center and the two sides folded downward from the rear it looks like an upside down v or alternately the caret and such designs are known as caret wings two to three years later the concept briefly came into the public eye due to the airliner work at the rae that led to the prospect of reaching australia in 90 minutes newspaper articles led to an appearance on scottish television citation needed hawker siddeley examined the caret wing waverider in the later 1960s as a part of a three stage lunar rocket design the first stage was built on an expanded blue steel the second a waverider and the third a nuclear powered manned stage this work was generalized in 1971 to produce a two staged reusable spacecraft the 121 foot 37 m long first stage was designed as a classical waverider with air breathing propulsion for return to the launch site the upper stage was designed as a lifting body and would have carried an 8000 pound 3 6 t payload to low earth orbit citation needed cone flow waveriders edit nonweiler s work was based on studies of planar 2d shocks due to the difficulty understanding and predicting real world shock patterns around 3d bodies as the study of hypersonic flows improved researchers were able to study waverider designs that used different shockwave shapes the simplest being the conical shock generated by a cone in these cases a waverider is designed to keep the rounded shockwave attached to its wings not a flat sheet which increases the volume of air trapped under the surface and thereby increases lift 5 unlike the caret wing the cone flow designs smoothly curve their wings from near horizontal in the center to highly drooped where they meet the shock like the caret wing they have to be designed to operate at a specific speed to properly attach the shock wave to the wing s leading edge but unlike them the entire body shape can be varied dramatically at the different design speeds and sometimes have wingtips that curve upward to attach to the shockwave citation needed further development of the conical sections adding canopies and fuselage areas led to the osculating cones waverider which develops several conical shock waves at different points on the body blending them to produce a single shaped shock the expansion to a wider range of compression surface flows allowed the design of waveriders with control of volume 5 upper surface shape engine integration and centre of pressure position performance improvements and off design analysis continued until 1970 6 7 during this period at least one waverider was tested at the woomera rocket range mounted on the nose of an air launched blue steel missile and a number of airframes were tested in the wind tunnel at nasa s ames research center however during the 1970s most work in hypersonics disappeared and the waverider along with it citation needed

august 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message one of the many differences between supersonic and hypersonic flight concerns the interaction of the boundary layer and the shock waves generated from the nose of the aircraft normally the boundary layer is quite thin compared to the streamline of airflow over the wing and can be considered separately from other aerodynamic effects however as the speed increases and the shock wave increasingly approaches the sides of the craft there comes a point where the two start to interact and the flowfield becomes very complex long before that point the boundary layer starts to interact with the air trapped between the shock wave and the fuselage the air that is being used for lift on a waverider calculating the effects of these interactions was beyond the abilities of aerodynamics until the introduction of useful computational fluid dynamics starting in the 1980s in 1981 maurice rasmussen at the university of oklahoma started a waverider renaissance by publishing a paper on a new 3d underside shape using these techniques these shapes have superior lifting performance and less drag since then whole families of cone derived waveriders have been designed using more and more complex conic shocks based on more complex software this work eventually led to a conference in 1989 the first international hypersonic waverider conference held at the university of maryland these newest shapes the viscous optimized waveriders look similar to conical designs as long as the angle of the shock wave on the nose is beyond some critical angle about 14 degrees for a mach 6 design for instance the angle of the shock can be controlled by widening out the nose into a curved plate of specific radius and reducing the radius produces a smaller shock cone angle vehicle design starts by selecting a given angle and then developing the body shape that traps that angle then repeating this process for different angles for any given speed a single shape will generate the best results design edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message during re entry hypersonic vehicles generate lift only from the underside of the fuselage the underside which is inclined to the flow at a high angle of attack creates lift in reaction to the vehicle wedging the airflow downwards the amount of lift is not particularly high compared to a traditional wing but more than enough to maneuver given the amount of distance the vehicle covers most re entry vehicles have been based on the blunt nose reentry design pioneered by theodore von kármán citation needed he demonstrated that a shock wave is forced to detach from a curved surface forced out into a larger configuration that requires considerable energy to form energy expended in forming this shock wave is no longer available as heat so this shaping can dramatically reduce the heat load on the spacecraft such a design has been the basis for almost every re entry vehicle since citation needed found on the blunt noses of the early icbm warheads the bottoms of the various nasa capsules and the large nose of the space shuttle the problem with the blunt nose system is that the resulting design creates very little lift meaning the vehicle has problems maneuvering during re entry if the spacecraft is meant to be able to return to its point of launch on command then some sort of maneuvering will be required to counteract the fact that the earth is turning under the spacecraft as it flies after a single low earth orbit the launching point will be over 1 000 km 600 mi to the east of the spacecraft by the time it has completed one full orbit a considerable amount of research was dedicated to combining the blunt nose system with wings leading to the development of the lifting body designs in the u s citation needed it was while working on one such design that nonweiler developed the waverider he noticed that the detachment of the shock wave over the blunt leading edges of the wings of the armstrong whitworth design would allow the air on the bottom of the craft to flow spanwise and escape to the upper part of the wing through the gap between the leading edge and the detached shock wave this loss of airflow reduced by up to a quarter the lift being generated by the waverider which led to studies on how to avoid this problem and keep the flow trapped under the wing nonweiler s resulting design is a delta wing with some amount of negative dihedral the wings are bent down from the fuselage towards the tips when viewed from the front the wing resembles a caret symbol in cross section and these designs are often referred to as carets the more modern 3d version typically looks like a rounded letter m theoretically a star shaped clarification needed waverider with a frontal cross section of a or could reduce drag by another 20 the disadvantage of this design is that it has more area in contact with the shock wave and therefore has more pronounced heat dissipation problems waveriders generally have sharp noses and sharp leading edges on their wings the underside shock surface remains attached to this air flowing in through the shock surface is trapped between the shock and the fuselage and can only escape at the rear of the fuselage with sharp edges all the lift is retained even though sharp edges get much hotter than rounded ones at the same air density the improved lift means that waveriders can glide on re entry at much higher altitudes where the air density is lower a list ranking various space vehicles in order of heating applied to the airframe would have capsules at the top re entering quickly with very high heating loads waveriders at the bottom extremely long gliding profiles at high altitude and the space shuttle somewhere in the middle simple waveriders have substantial design problems first the obvious designs only work at a particular mach number and the amount of lift captured will change dramatically as the vehicle changes speed another problem is that the waverider depends on radiative cooling possible as long as the vehicle spends most of its time at very high altitudes however these altitudes also demand a very large wing to generate the needed lift in the thin air and that same wing can become rather unwieldy at lower altitudes and speeds because of these problems waveriders have not found favor with practical aerodynamic designers despite the fact that they might make long distance hypersonic vehicles efficient enough to carry air freight some researchers who controversially citation needed claim that there are designs that overcome these problems one candidate for a multi speed waverider is a caret wing operated at different angles of attack a caret wing is a delta wing with longitudinal conical or triangular slots or strakes it strongly resembles a paper airplane or rogallo wing the correct angle of attack would become increasingly precise at higher mach numbers but this is a control problem that is theoretically solvable the wing is said to perform even better if it can be constructed of tight mesh because that reduces its drag while maintaining lift such wings are said to have the unusual attribute of operating at a wide range of mach numbers in different fluids with a wide range of reynolds numbers the temperature problem can be solved with some combination of a transpiring surface exotic materials and possibly heat pipes in a transpiring surface small amounts of a coolant such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft s skin see transpiration and perspiration this design works for mach 25 spacecraft re entry shields and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry the weight of the coolant exotic materials such as carbon carbon composite do not conduct heat but endure it but they tend to be brittle heatpipes are not widely used at present like a conventional heat exchanger they conduct heat better than most solid materials but like a thermosiphon are passively pumped the boeing x 51a deals with external heating through the use of a tungsten nosecone and space shuttle style heat shield tiles on its belly internal engine heating is absorbed by using the jp 7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion 8 other high temperature materials referred to as sharp materials typically zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride have been used on steering vanes for icbm reentry vehicles since the 1970s and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles they are said to permit mach 11 flight at 100 000 ft 30 000 m altitudes and mach 7 flight at sea level these materials are more structurally rugged than the reinforced carbon composite rcc used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties and do not suffer from oxidation issues that rcc needs to be protected against with coatings 9 10 references edit

corps central power battery intending to kill him once the black lantern corps is dealt with 31 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe mongul is once again reintroduced as lord and master of the planetary siege engine warworld in his introduction he is laying waste to a planet he is poised to conquer as he brought a resisting general aboard his vessel in order to show him the devastation of his homeworld just before killing him and adding his remains to a trophy room on warworld 32 mongul makes a brief appearance in the superman doomed story arc he manages to escape the phantom zone alongside similarly powerful villains such as non and prepares to attack earth upon learning that brainiac has arrived on earth mongul stricken with fear immediately heads back into the phantom zone 33 wonder woman later enters the phantom zone and traps him in her lasso of truth before ordering mongul s warworld to attack brainiac s ship sometime after his imprisonment mongul would escape the phantom zone with warworld in tow eventually setting his sights on revenge against sinestro and his fear corps for prior injuries long past by seeking to lure him out using black mercies on korugarian refugees then draining his ring to uselessness through leftover technologies of the old universal survivor relic which he had integrated into warworld s systems 34 mongul would use him as a bargaining chip to call the rest of his corpsmen to do battle over warworld to rescue their leader so he could cow them back into his services again while seeking to coax the emotional entity parallax from within his hated rival out into the open all to truly take command of the sinestro corps once again 35 his plan was going without a hitch so far even with the untimely arrival of bekka of the new gods lending much needed assistance but the tables were turned when the apex league a team of mercenaries whom he had enlisted eventually turned on him at sinestro s suggestion after mongul s prisoner reversed the energy siphon afterwards he would entrap his assailant in scrap metal lined with yellow ring fragments before jettisoning him into deep space a bright and shiny lure the pale vicors would be drawn to the interstellar warlord would resurface as an enslaved thrall of the pailing when his new masters attacked the earth at their lord marshal s clarion call now in the service of anti emotion mongul had returned to battle sinestro more powerful than ever while aiding in the subjugation of humanity 36 the battle would rage and sinestro would recruit many amongst the planet into his corps to defend it eventually black adam yet another addition to the yellow lanterns would cast him out of the fight just long enough for his brother in arms to deliver the killing blow to mongul and the pailing s leader the pale bishop 37 in the aftermath of the battle sinestro ceded control of his corps to his daughter soranik due to his injuries while the sinestro corpsmen helped earth rebuild mongul would stir from his zombified state hellbent on getting sinestro for feeding him to the pail vicors seeing as he was surrounded by manhunters however he opted a hasty retreat to earth in order to bide his time instead 38 dc rebirth edit mongul appears as a main villain in trinity where his use of the green causes poison ivy to capture superman batman and wonder woman and causes them to undergo hallucinations of their own childhoods the three are eventually able to reduce mongul s influence over his other world mongul is briefly a member of a new version of the superman revenge squad also consisting of general zod metallo cyborg superman eradicator and blanque after superman is temporarily blinded they are defeated when lex luthor supergirl superwoman kong kenan and steel come to superman s aid and zod betrays the rest of the team for his own ends 39 mongul later escapes prison 40 and somehow traps the justice league inside of an intergalactic arena around the time they are investigating barbatos 41 they construct a mecha out of mongul s creatures and frighten him away but upon returning to earth discover that it has been sacked by barbatos powers and abilities edit during the bronze age of comic books mongul was stronger than superman and almost totally invulnerable to harm 6 7 superman defeated him by foiling his schemes but only once defeated mongul in hand to hand combat even then superman fell unconscious immediately afterward 7 mongul also demonstrated the ability to teleport 6 limited telepathy and telekinesis 7 and could project blasts of potent force via his eyes 5 hands 6 or chest the character also used technology to shrink his enemies and place them in dimensional inversion cubes designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within 7 the modern age mongul started off with less power than the bronze age version but was still a formidable foe and a capable match up against superman on multiple occasions although slightly weaker mongul was able to resist half power kryptonian heat vision at point blank range and thanks to his enhanced musculature was incredibly resilient to physical harm because of his impressive muscle structure mongul was also incredibly fast and able to push himself forward at high speed while running or able to leap several miles into the air by his powerful legs he also had his chest cannon with which he could fire potent energy blasts that could stagger or kill even superman so formidable a foe was he that mongul could not only trade blows with kryptonians but repeatedly battle green lanterns on a regular basis especially given that his natural yellow skin gave him protection against their rings he was still outclassed though by individuals of greater capability be it physical or technological in nature such as hank henshaw before and after his acquisition of superman s genetic template and the demon neron who killed him with his bare hands his progeny mongul ii however showed himself to either be on equal footing or in greater strength than even his father having demonstrated enough might for defeating dc universe heavy hitters like wonder woman infinite crisis 1 december 2005 along with killing members of both the green lantern and sinestro corps in his pursuit of power rings he was strong enough to kill his sister mongal in one blow 14 when acquiring his first yellow lantern ring he decided to learn about its potential for 96 hours hinting at a methodical mindset mostly absent from yellow lanterns mongul ii also battled superman leading to his defeat after both delivered many blows leading to superman unleashing a massive combination attack required to overpower this villain superman vol 2 152 january 2000 this battle displayed him having an endurance to massive blows from a being as powerful as superman after having obtained several qwardian power rings he showed a rather avid usage of their power for numerous effects i e having used them along with his father s innate knowledge of the black mercy to modify the plant s parasitic behavioral patterns inducing frightful mirages over happy fantasies create and manipulate fear driven constructs powerful enough to batter an ion empowered sodom yat and reattach destroyed or removed limbs or body parts via precise fear energy material rearrangement in the new universe mongul has been radically re imagined from being the formidable adversary he once was during the bronze silver ages now back in control over warworld he again started cutting a bloody swath across the universe conquering planet after planet with his cosmic dreadnaught when he makes his way to earth he showcases extreme levels of super strength and resilience as he gets into a colossal battle between superman and an empowered batman who at the time had kryptonian like power sets 42 kal el once stated him to be about as strong as darkseid this is proven true in a number of cases where he showed his might by fighting off an entire brigade of yellow lanterns backed by a new god within their ranks 35 he still retains his chest cannon which can still blow away multiple personages in one blast as well as heat vision to incinerate his enemies 34 this new mongul is tougher faster and more powerful than ever easily able to take on individuals or groups as powerful as lantern corpsmen or even new gods as well as survive virtually unscathed in the event that he does suffer from critical abrasion mongul also has a slight healing factor with which to help him recover almost from anything the limits of which were never probed 43 he even showcased the natural capacity of flight with or without assisted propulsion more than once 38 for a time he was also part of the sinestro corps having access to all that it entailed i e the ability to create fear based energy constructs gaining power from the fears of others and acquiring a power battery with which to recharge his ring 35 after he had been deposed by sinestro who later requisitioned warworld for his own cause mongul would end up in the services of the pale vicors an anti emotional sect which razed planets of their resources and their inhabitants by nullifying their ability to feel and or empathize before harvesting the targeted worlds resources 44 having been given enormous power at the cost of his own individual freedom the pailing made mongul stronger beyond imagining with all new powers and abilities which allowed him to match and overpower the likes of sinestro and a yellow ring empowered black adam with ease he could even singlehandedly stalemate the very firepower of warworld itself which had been commandeered at the time by the sinestro corpsman ranx 45 as a pail vicor mongul possessed all the natural powers which came with it armed with his lance he could emit a form of apathetic force which negated the powers of the emotional spectrum giving him similar construct forming abilities akin to a lantern ring only angled to use other sentient beings emotional anguish to drive the emotion out of them rendering the afflicted unfeeling empty shells of who and or what they used to be he could also use its power to fly and emit energy blasts with the same energy negating effects as the protective aura which shrouds all the pailing 37 in other media edit television edit mongul in batman the brave and the bold mongul appears in the animated television series justice

fictional robots from the dc comics universe the robots resembled superman in appearance and abilities contents 1 history 1 1 silver age versions 1 2 modern age versions 2 other versions 3 in other media 3 1 television 3 2 film 3 3 video games 4 references 5 external links history edit silver age versions edit superman robots played a particularly dominant role in late 1950s and 1960s era superman comics when readers were first introduced to superman possessing various robot duplicates these robots each possessed a fraction of the man of steel s powers and were sometimes used to substitute for him on missions such as those where kryptonite was present or for the purposes of protecting his secret identity to that end superman also possessed a few clark kent robots 1 one notable superman robot was named ajax also known as wonder man 2 other superman robots had other names including robot z 3 robot x 3 4 and macduff 5 the idea of superman robots were extended into superboy stories of the period as well where it was revealed that superboy also possessed robot duplicates of himself both as superboy and as clark kent nearly all of these robots were either deactivated or converted into adult sized robots when superboy grew up to become superman 6 there was also supergirl and linda lee robots so that superman s teenage cousin could be a hero while at the same time seemingly be at class 7 also while not superman robots per se superman had other machines who could pass for human for example in one 1960 superman story mr and mrs crandall adopt bizarro s human looking infant son who had wandered into midvale orphanage the crandalls were really robots who only pretended to adopt the baby so that their master superman could take custody of the child 8 in the early 1970s the superman comics largely abandoned the use of superman robots as part of a change in the books tone and writing style the excuse given in the comics was that earth s pollution levels and artificial radiation had rendered superman s robots unusable 9 modern age versions edit the notion of superman robots was reintroduced for post crisis comic continuity in a late 1990s storyline during the period where superman under the control of dominus felt he must police the entire earth 24 hours a day 7 days a week he built an army of superman robots created in his own image all wearing the famous s shield but wearing variations of the red blue and yellow costume however unlike the pre crisis superman robots these automata were not realistic androids capable of passing for the real superman but instead were obviously mechanical with metallic bodies that possessed no artificial skin these modern superman robot s powers included super strength flight and heat vision but were inferior to superman s own powers the superman robots were also given a small degree of sentience making each one an autonomous agent of the man of steel their job was to protect mankind aggressively if necessary and attend to crises beyond superman s reach once dominus had been defeated superman had most of the robots destroyed one particular robot programmed to protect lois was particularly difficult to get rid of in superman vol 2 170 jeph loeb wrote a story where in defending lois lane from certain death krypto almost killed mongul by ripping his throat out believing that krypto was too dangerous to have around superman confined him to the fortress of solitude a superman robot nicknamed ned presumably the same one programmed to protect lois was employed as krypto s caretaker the robot was programmed to give off superman s scent every now and again to keep krypto happy in a later storyline brainiac 8 revived and increased the power to a forgotten superman robot the robot attacked the teen titans killing troia and omen before it was defeated 10 other versions edit in superman red son the superman robots are actually soviet citizens lobotomized and fitted with cybernetic implants as punishment for speaking or acting against the soviet regime i e pytor roslov and the batmen 11 in grant morrison s all star superman a league of superman robots is seen operating various equipment in superman s fortress of solitude towards the end of the series the majority of these robots sacrifice themselves by aiding superman in a battle with solaris the tyrant sun 12 the robots have a more obvious robotic appearance with blue capes and the yellow and red on the s insignia transposed 13 14 15 in the miniseries tangent superman s reign the stronghold of that world s superman is protected by fearsome looking insectoid robots during an attempted robbery one hero makes a comment about superman s robots in other media edit television edit the super friends episode the death of superman has a superman robot give other members of the team a tour of the fortress of solitude while also informing them of a meditation technique superman may have used to survive his recent apparent death in the superman the animated series episode legacy kara used and controls a robot superman and a robot clark kent after he went missing actually kidnapped and brainwashed by darkseid however lex luthor had known for some time that superman was a robot in the justice league episode a better world the alternate earth of the justice lords is shown to have its own version of arkham asylum populated by several members of batman s rogues gallery all the inmates have been lobotomized by that world s superman and any hostilities are dealt with by a contingent of superman robots they are dressed the same as that world s superman featuring a black white and red color scheme when the good wonder woman fails to give the correct password a lobotomized joker triggers an alarm and several robots battle the league members present in the legion of super heroes episode message in a bottle a damaged superman robot was seen in the abandoned fortress of solitude resembling the cyborg superman in one episode of the krypto the superdog animated series a kryptonian construct called dogbot was painted to resemble krypto and as superdogbot filled in for the real thing for a short time the superman robots appear in the justice league action episode battle for the bottled city they appear as one of the defenses of the fortress of solitude at the time when brainiac plans to reclaim the bottled city of kandor that was taken from him back in plastic man saves the world brainiac manages to destroy some of them one superman robot was piloted by atom in order to fight and defeat brainiac film edit in superman doomsday a superman robot voiced by tom kenny features quite prominently in the plot the superman robot has a very mechanical design the only resemblance to superman being the s logo on its chest the robot is seen in the beginning of the film maintaining the fortress of solitude and providing superman and lois information on doomsday after superman s apparent death the robot rescues superman s comatose body from lex luthor s building and brings superman back to the fortress to nurse him back to health the robot is referred to simply as the robot and plays a role similar to the eradicator in all star superman based on the acclaimed storyline by grant morrison the robots fill the same role as in the books except one of the differences is that the robots have their numbers on their symbols instead of the usual superman s in superman vs the elite the robots are seen working at the fortress of solitude transporting lois and aiding superman in the ruse during the final battle video games edit in the video game injustice gods among us the robots appear in cyborg s ending after he defeated the regime s superman cyborg discovers a

monster battle ultra galaxy the ultras are a technologically advanced civilization originating from a planet within the m78 nebula m78星雲 emu nanajūhachi seiun b three million light years away from earth not to be confused with the messier 78 nebula colloquially called the land of light 光の国 hikari no kuni who were originally identical to humans they had evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the plasma spark which replaced their dead sun ultraman and his many kind are usually red and silver although several color variations have been seen in recent years and have glowing yellow almond shaped dome eyes although there are exceptions to both the shape and color and various abilities most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight they share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty a majority of ultramen joining the space garrison 宇宙警備隊 uchū keibitai to maintain peace in the universe from alien invaders and monsters the ultras that are sent to other worlds are given color timers or warning lights which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an ultra s energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere an ultra can remain active on earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die this forces an ultra to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body the latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own life force ultra beings also appear to be near impossible to permanently kill as several times an ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species an ultra being can be revived with a massive energy infusion as when mebius allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by alien empera s army ultras always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders and try to minimize collateral property damage if these concerns cannot be met a city like tokyo could be destroyed the ultraman phenomenon edit the show ultraman was followed by many other series sequels to the

ultraman news newspapers books scholar jstor june 2022 learn how and when to remove this template message ultraman s licensing rights outside japan have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between tsuburaya productions and chaiyo productions also called tsuburaya chaiyo co ltd based in thailand tsuburaya had previously collaborated with chaiyo on the production of two movies the 6 ultra brothers vs the monster army and jumborg ace giant the latter of which featured another tsuburaya superhero jumborg ace in 1974 sompote saengduenchai founder president of chaiyo productions claimed and maintained that in 1976 that noboru tsuburaya the son of the late eiji tsuburaya had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything ultraman outside japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan in spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to tsuburaya in exchange for these rights japanese and thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed hanko of the late noboru tsuburaya who had died in 1995 in the document tsuburaya productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery due to factual errors including the faulty titles of the series in the document such as ultra q being called ultraman 1 ultra q ultraseven being called ultraman 3 ultraman seven and tsuburaya productions being called tsuburaya prod and enterprises a name the company never did business under and repeatedly contested the issue in the course of the legal battle sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of thai buddhist edifices stating that eiji had based ultraman s face on those edifices a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began no other evidence supporting this claim is known to exist after an eight year battle in the courts of both countries sompote saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on 27 april 2004 the exact ruling fell into some dispute some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six ultra series ultra q through ultraman taro and jumborg ace outside japan and broadcasting rights of those shows within thailand other accounts usually reported in the thai asian media said that chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside japan the latter could be taken as chaiyo s side of the story as tsuburaya was reported in the japanese media to continue taking further action against them tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six ultra series outside japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with chaiyo although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the ultraman programs created after ultraman taro including the theatrical feature ultraman the next throughout the world because of the copyright struggle importing literature on ultraman into singapore and malaysia was prohibited it also resulted in a slight backlash against thai ultraman fans who were assumed to be outright chaiyo supporters in 2005 the american company bci home entertainment bci eclipse a subsidiary of navarre corporation announced they had acquired the dvd license to ultraman from distributor golden media group inc a hollywood based distributor who secured the rights from tokyo based um corp inc acting as the global agent for chaiyo a three disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on 18 july 2006 followed by a second three disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on 7 november 2006 both sets feature the japanese stereo audio created by tsuburaya productions and pioneer for their japanese r 2 dvd release in 1999 as well as the english dubbed version produced by united artists for north american syndication the original japanese monaural was not included unfortunately the english audio for episodes 5 through 39 were not all complete as bci sourced private home off air audio recordings from an unknown television broadcast which were cut to provide for more commercial time therefore the episodes in question would switch to japanese audio from english audio to cover the missing gaps due to these gaps bci s publicity department assumed the original series was edited by ua tv when it was originally prepared for u s syndication only minor seconds of extreme violence were trimmed from three episodes none of which contained dialogue tsuburaya productions had a complete run of the ua tv s version which their los angeles office ultracom inc retrieved from a u s film warehouse in 1993 in 1994 they provided the english audio for the expressions in animation vhs release of the first four episodes which were sourced for the corresponding episodes in the bci release during the time of the legal battle chaiyo came up with three of their own ultras ultraman millennium dark ultraman an evil ultra and ultraman elite these were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise chaiyo also created a tv series that he called project ultraman unaired as of late march 2008 a joint project in china featuring their own ultraman and attaching hong kong star ekin cheng to the project on 23 august 2006 tsuburaya productions filed a new lawsuit against chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism concerning their three original ultraman characters and the court case was taken to china the chinese courts in beijing opened the ultraman copyright study group in response to the lawsuit 17 in april 2007 the thailand intellectual property court ruled in favor of tsuburaya productions ordering chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from chaiyo produced ultraman characters such as millennium dark and elite the defendants were also fined thb 15 000 000 approx jpy 50 904 959 or us 428 673 50 c april 2007 plus interest and attorneys fees 18 19 project ultraman went on hiatus as a result of the ruling which implied that although chaiyo owned the right to some of the ultraman series it did not own the right to ultraman and his brothers including the design chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series but lost the right to create and market its own ultraman or even use the original without tsuburaya s consent citation needed on 5 february 2008 thailand s supreme court ruled in favor of tsuburaya productions of japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling the ruling ended the long legal battle by finding sompote saengduenchai was not a co creator of ultraman the decision ended sompote s bid to continue his enterprise and the court gave sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from ultraman the final ruling saw tsuburaya productions as the sole copyright owner sompote was also required to pay thb 10 700 000 plus interest at the rate of 7 5 percent a year starting from 16 december 1997 when the original lawsuit was filed 20 in 2009 the thai intellectual property court and the tokyo district court both ruled in favour of the thai company this led to the tokyo district court on 30 september 2010 ordering tsuburaya productions co of japan to pay damages of 16 36 million yen bt5 9 million to sompote saengduenchai of thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on the ultraman characters 21 after the announcement of the film dragon force so long ultraman in july 2017 the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated 22 but on 20 november 2017 through a los angeles court ruling by judge andre birotte jr tsuburaya won the lawsuit against chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between noboru tsuburaya and chaiyo was not authentic 23 24 despite um corporation and chaiyo filing a counter dispute 25 on 18 april 2018 the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid forbidding umc to use the ultra series and all its related characters and forced them to pay tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights 26 with the release of the sequel film dragon force rise of ultraman zh chinese 钢铁飞龙之奥特曼崛起 pinyin gāngtiě fēilóng zhī àotèmàn juéqǐ issues between umc bluearc and tsubaraya had reignited and the company took legal actions against the two companies again 27 on 10 december 2019 it was confirmed by tsuburaya that the court has rejected umc and bluearc s appeal for a retrial stating the court s first verdict of regarding the rights and ownership of ultraman to tsuburaya is still legitimate and final and that any future appeals by umc and bluearc will likely be rejected 28 as umc and bluearc failed to file a further appeal by 4 march 2020 they were to pay us 4 000 000 approx 400 000 000 japanese yen in compensatory damages as well as other various court fees 29 the resulting victory has reached thailand as well and the thai supreme court ordered a ruling in favor tsuburaya productions as the legitimate copyright owner of the shows listed in the license granting agreement alongside ownership over hanuman vs 7 ultraman and its remake hanuman vs 11 ultraman and jumborg ace giant 30 sompote had made an appeal to the court over the decision but was dismissed 31 sompote believes the decision would affect the former two movies status as national heritage items and has appealed to both the supreme court and ministry of culture on that front 32 malaysian book ban edit on 6 march 2014 the malaysian ministry of home affairs announced that it had banned the publication of an ultraman comic book ultraman the ultra power due to contents that were detrimental to public order 33 34 social media users later noticed that a page in the book described the character of ultraman king from the film mega monster battle ultra galaxy as a god which in the malaysian language is the arabic word allah the home ministry later confirmed that the use of allah was indeed the reason for the ban claiming that the comparison may confuse muslim children and damage their faith 35 36 this highlighted the larger ban to prevent non muslims in malaysia from using the word allah despite its common usage in bahasa melayu to refer to any god as well as a suit from the catholic church of malaysia over its usage 37 television edit series edit

first appeared in superman 264 june 1973 in a story written by cary bates and penciled by curt swan 3 when editor julius schwartz suggested adding a sportscaster to clark kent s news reporter bates decided to create a workplace adversary for kent to contrast with kent s friendly relationship with the other characters drawing partial inspiration from the character ted baxter of the mary tyler moore show 4 lombard s physical model was real life football star joe namath 4 for several years after steve lombard s debut he appeared in nearly every published superman story action comics writer martin pasko later attempted to explain the character s popularity lombard is one of the few examples of a character that all of us superman scripters at that time wrote in more or less the same way as opposed to say the way lana lang seemed to be a totally different character when she d show up in action on occasion i think that s because lombard was one of the most sharply drawn and purposefully designed though not particularly complex characters i ve ever handled the most clearly communicated idea i ve ever heard from an editor and the writer who co created it the jock doofus unwittingly trying to bust superman s cajónes the audience waits for it knowing that a hotfoot with a match won t trump a hotfoot from heat vision or whatever and i gather the other superman writers thought so too that s why lombard became for me at least one of the best examples of what in sitcoms we call the run through character that s certainly what ted baxter was on tv the character you knew you could run through a scene and get laughs just from his showing up the audience starts laughing when they show up because they re laughing at what they re imagining is gonna happen they re waiting for it 4 bates wrote steve lombard out of the comic in superman 384 though his final pre crisis on infinite earths appearance was not until superman 413 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in pre crisis continuity steve the slinger lombard is a quarterback for the fictional nfl team the metropolis meteors the day before his team is to play in the super bowl steve exacerbates existing injuries to his knees while saving a baby falling from a building an experimental radiation treatment cures his knees but also produces an energy being resembling lombard in his football uniform the energy being responds to lombard s thoughts and begins scoring touchdowns in his place as lombard had missed most of the game due to his accident initially taking credit for the energy being s performance lombard publicly confesses the truth after the being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by superman steve resigns from the meteors and retires from football over his actions leading morgan edge to hire him as a sportscaster for galaxy broadcasting working alongside anchor clark kent on the six o clock news 1 5 steve is portrayed as brash and arrogant and often plays childish pranks on clark kent addressing him as clarkie which kent usually counters with the subtle use of his super powers however steve also considers clark one of his few real friends since he takes steve s behavior in stride and never bears him a grudge steve has a brother named vernon who is a doctor and a nephew named jaime 6 steve also has an aunt kaye daye who is a mystery novelist who works with the mystery analysts of gotham city 7 morgan edge ultimately fires steve after many years due to his declining popularity with the viewing audience steve goes to clark s apartment seeking solace only to be attacked by a former college roommate who did not shrug off steve s pranks as well as clark did and obtained superhuman powers to get revenge in a rare display of genuine courage and humanity steve forces clark to safety before confronting his opponent although clark returns as superman and rescues steve 8 post crisis edit lombard was not part of the original reboot of the superman storyline that began in john byrne s 1986 the man of steel mini series his first post crisis appearance is as a news anchor on wgbs tv in the adventures of superman 467 june 1990 as of the

there before leaving to work for wgbs action comics annual 11 may 2008 gives the following information on steve sports reporter steve lombard played football in high school college and briefly for the pros he sees himself as a man s man everything clark kent is not in fact he is a walking encyclopedia of sports trivia and put downs lombard cannot figure out why lois lane does not throw herself at him it is also stated that steve often butts heads with coworker ron troupe in the 2008 brainiac storyline he makes a crude sexual advance to lois right in front of clark he insults ron troupe s choice of subject matter thinking articles critical of sports means ron hates them he takes great joy in assaulting colleagues with a football laughing at their torment however once actual danger arises he is quick to take charge and work with others in order to make sure everyone is safe for example he and ron save cat grant s life 10 the 2009 2010 miniseries superman secret origin established that lombard in post infinite crisis continuity was already on the staff of the daily planet when clark began working at the newspaper 11 steve s first rebirth appearance is a crude confrontation with lois in the daily planet newsroom 12 steve is shot in the shoulder when he attempts to stop a crazed gunman from killing various daily planet employees he is later seen being led away from the building 13 the cosmic level threat the h dial manifests itself in a superpowered being called the early adopter appearing in the middle of the daily planet newsroom steve picks a fight

track to investigate after the fbi investigation the authorities said the rope had been hanging there since last fall and thus was not a hate crime targeting wallace the agencies said no crime was committed and the evidence did not support federal charges 12 13 the actions of nascar especially nascar president steve phelps s claim of it being a hate crime without investigation have been criticized 14 holman w jenkins jr on the wall street journal claimed the controversy and media furor concerning the incident could have been prevented by not contacting fbi and nascar authorities

from a kryptonite meteor that a criminal has dropped towards him at her insistence jimmy wishes the dying girl out of existence dc used this story to gauge public response to the concept of a completely new female counterpart to superman in the original issue she has blond hair and her costume is blue and red like superman s indeed it closely resembles the uniform that actress helen slater would later wear in the 1984 movie early reprints of this story show her with red hair and an orange and green costume to prevent readers from confusing her with the then current supergirl character much later the story was again reprinted in its original form original character kara edit main article supergirl kara zor el debut edit after positive fan reaction to super girl the first recurring

affected by the explosion of the great planet s fissionable core and underwent a slow but steady chain reaction turning into green kryptonite using raw deposits and refined materials at hand the residents of argo city laid down a ground shield of lead foil to protect them from the developing kryptonite zor el was also able to fashion a makeshift propulsion system to try to accelerate the city s approach to the solar system during the roughly 30 years argo city traveled through space zor el met and married alura daughter of in ze who in turn bore their daughter kara blond like her parents but before the propulsion system was able to steer the city toward earth a deranged citizen named jer em who was suffering from survival guilt damaged the exhaust veering argo toward a swarm of

her rightful but tragic place in the timestream however finding no assurance that ariella survived the restoration of post crisis history a dejected linda relinquishes the role of supergirl sends a farewell note to superman and leaves for points unknown 12 peter david s creator owned series fallen angel published by dc comics is set in a fictional city named bete noire and features a character lee who is similar to linda and explores the same themes as his supergirl series prior to fallen angel moving to another company lee was written in a manner such that she could have been linda though david remained coy as to whether the two characters were one and the same during the dc run of the title after it moved to idw david revealed lee s origin which clearly showed that lee was not danvers however fallen angel 14 introduced lin who was said to be lee s predecessor as the guardian of bete noire 13 lin had recently escaped limbo an apparent metaphor for what happened to danvers after the cancellation of supergirl david wrote in his december 13 2006 blog entry any fans of my run on supergirl particularly those who are torqued because linda danvers was consigned to oblivion in the dcu must must must pick up fallen angel 14 and 15 when they come out next year 14 however since david could not explicitly claim that a character owned by dc was the same as the character he owned he stated can i say this is linda danvers of course i can t however it s pretty freaking obvious that it is 15 according to an interview with newsarama 16 the matrix supergirl is wiped from existence by the events depicted in the 2005 limited series infinite crisis although infinite crisis writer geoff johns later stated that danvers is not 17 the debate was finally settled in the 2008 miniseries

impact on the early medieval history of scandinavia the british isles france estonia and kievan rus 10 expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships vikings established norse settlements and governments in the british isles the faroe islands iceland greenland normandy and the baltic coast as well as along the dnieper and volga trade routes across modern day russia belarus 11 and ukraine 12 where they were also known as varangians the normans norse gaels rus people faroese and icelanders emerged from these norse colonies at one point a group of rus vikings went so far south that after briefly being bodyguards for the byzantine emperor attacked the byzantine city of constantinople 13 vikings also voyaged to iran 14 and arabia 15 they were the first europeans to reach north america briefly settling in newfoundland vinland while spreading norse culture to foreign lands they simultaneously brought home slaves concubines and foreign cultural influences to scandinavia influencing the genetic 16 and historical development of both during the viking age the norse homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three larger kingdoms denmark norway and sweden the vikings spoke old norse and made inscriptions in runes for most of the period they followed the old norse religion but later became christians the vikings had their own laws art and architecture most vikings were also farmers fishermen craftsmen and traders popular conceptions of the vikings often strongly differ from the complex advanced civilisation of the norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources a romanticised picture of vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the 18th century this developed and became widely propagated during the 19th century viking revival 17 18 perceived views of the vikings as violent piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much to conflicting varieties of the modern viking myth that had taken shape by the early 20th century current popular representations of the vikings are typically based on cultural clichés and stereotypes complicating modern appreciation of the viking legacy these

etymology of viking is uncertain in the middle ages it came to mean scandinavian pirate or raider 20 21 22 the anglo saxons regarded the word wicing as synonymous with pirate and in several old english sources wicing is translated into the latin pirata it was not seen as a reference to nationality with other terms such as norþmenn northmen and dene danes being used for that in asser s life of alfred the danes are referred to as pagani pagans but this is usually translated as vikings in modern english which some regard as a mistake 23 the earliest reference to wicing in english sources is from the épinal erfurt glossary which dates to around 700 whereas the first known attack by viking raiders in england at lindisfarne was in 793 24 25 the origin of wicing is disputed with some believing that it is a loan word from old norse 26 the form occurs as a personal name on some swedish runestones the stone of tóki víking sm 10 was raised in memory of a local man named tóki who got the name tóki víking toki the viking presumably because of his activities as a viking 27 the gårdstånga stone dr 330 uses the phrase þeʀ drængaʀ waʀu wiða unesiʀ i wikingu these valiant men were widely renowned on viking raids 28 referring to the stone s dedicatees as vikings the västra strö 1 runestone has an inscription in memory of a björn who was killed when on a viking raid 29 30 in sweden there is a locality known since the middle ages as vikingstad the bro stone u 617 was raised in memory of assur who is said to have protected the land from vikings saʀ vaʀ vikinga vorðr með gæiti 31 32 there is little indication of any negative connotation in the term before the end of the viking age other theories suggest that its origin is from the old english wicing and old frisian wizing that are almost 300 years older and probably derive from wic related to the latin vicus village habitation 26 another less popular theory is that víking from the feminine vík meaning creek inlet small bay 33 it has been suggested that the word viking may be derived from the name of the historical norwegian district of víkin meaning a person from víkin but people from the viken area were called víkverir vík dwellers not viking in old norse manuscripts the explanation could explain only the masculine víkingr and not the feminine víking the masculine is more easily derived from the feminine than the other way around 34 35 36 another etymology that gained support in the early twenty first century derives viking from the same root as old norse vika f sea mile originally the distance between two shifts of rowers from the root weik or wîk as in the proto germanic verb wîkan to recede 37 38 39 40 this is found in the proto nordic verb wikan to turn similar to old icelandic víkja ýkva víkva to move to turn with well attested nautical usages 41 linguistically this theory is better attested 41 and the term most likely predates the use of the sail by the germanic peoples of northwestern europe because the old frisian spelling witsing or wīsing shows that the word was pronounced with a palatal k and thus in all probability existed in north western germanic before that palatalisation happened in the 5th century or before in the western branch 40 39 42 the stora hammars i image stone showing the saga of hildr under what may be the rite of blood eagle and on the bottom a viking ship the old norse feminine víking as in the phrase fara í víking may originally have been a long distance sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers and a víkingr the masculine would originally have been a participant on such a sea journey in that case the idea behind it seems to be that the tired rower moves aside for the rested rower on the thwart when he relieves him this implies that the word viking was not originally connected to scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the scandinavians began to dominate the seas 37 even the word vikingr did not necessarily possess negative overtones or were always associated with violence and only in the post viking age would negative overtones be attached to the word 43 in eastern europe of which parts were ruled by a norse elite víkingr came to be perceived as a positive concept meaning hero in the russian borrowed form vityaz витязь 44 in old english the word wicing appears first in the anglo saxon poem widsith probably from the 9th century in old english and in the history of the archbishops of hamburg bremen written by adam of bremen in about 1070 the term generally referred to scandinavian pirates or raiders as in the old norse usages the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general the word does not occur in any preserved middle english texts one theory made by the icelander örnolfur kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is wicinga cynn in widsith referring to the people or the race living in jórvík york in the ninth century under control by norsemen jór wicings though this is not the origin of jórvík 45 the word viking was introduced into modern english during the 18th century viking revival at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of barbarian warrior or noble savage during the 20th century the meaning of the term was expanded to refer not only to seaborne raiders from scandinavia and other places settled by them like iceland and the faroe islands but also any member of the culture that produced the raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid 11th centuries or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100 as an adjective the word is used to refer to ideas phenomena or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life producing expressions like viking age viking culture viking art viking religion viking ship and so on 45 other names europe in 814 roslagen is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked swedes and goths the vikings were known as ascomanni ashmen by the germans for the ash wood of their boats 46 dubgail and finngail dark and fair foreigners by the irish 47 lochlannaich people from the land of lakes by the gaels 48 dene dane by the anglo saxons 49 and northmonn by the frisians 42 the scholarly consensus 50 is that the rus people originated in what is currently coastal eastern sweden around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as roslagen in sweden with the older name being roden 51 52 53 according to the prevalent theory the name rus like the proto finnic name for sweden ruotsi is derived from an old norse term for the men who row rods as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of eastern europe and that it could be linked to the swedish coastal area of roslagen rus law or roden as it was known in earlier times 54 55 the name rus would then have the same origin as the finnish and estonian names for sweden ruotsi and rootsi 55 56 the slavs and the byzantines also called them varangians russian варяги from old norse væringjar sworn men from vàr confidence vow of fealty related to old english wær agreement treaty promise old high german wara faithfulness 57 scandinavian bodyguards of the byzantine emperors were known as the varangian guard the rus initially appeared in serkland in the 9th century travelling as merchants along the volga trade route selling furs honey and slaves as well as luxury goods such as amber frankish swords and walrus ivory these goods were mostly exchanged for arabian silver coins called dirhams hoards of 9th century baghdad minted silver coins have been found in sweden particularly in gotland during and after the viking raid on seville in 844 ce the muslim chroniclers of al andalus referred to the vikings as magians arabic al majus مجوس conflating them with zoroastrians from persia 58 when ahmad ibn fadlan encountered vikings on the volga he referred to them as rus 59 60 61 the franks normally called them northmen or danes while for the english they were generally known as danes or heathen and the irish knew them as pagans or gentiles 62 anglo scandinavian is an academic term referring to the people and archaeological and historical periods during the 8th to 13th centuries in which there was migration to and occupation of the british isles by scandinavian peoples generally known in english as vikings it is used in distinction from anglo saxon similar terms exist for other areas such as hiberno norse for ireland and scotland history viking age main article viking age sea faring norsemen depicted invading england illuminated illustration from the 12th century miscellany on the life of st edmund pierpont morgan library the viking age in scandinavian history is taken to have been the period from the earliest recorded raids by norsemen in 793 until the norman conquest of england in 1066 63 vikings used the norwegian sea and baltic sea for sea routes to the south the normans were descendants of those vikings who had been given feudal overlordship of areas in northern france namely the duchy of normandy in the 10th century in that respect descendants of the vikings continued to have an influence in northern europe likewise king harold godwinson the last anglo saxon king of england had danish ancestors two vikings even ascended to the throne of england with sweyn forkbeard claiming the english throne in 1013 until 1014 and his son cnut the great being king of england between 1016 and 1035 64 65 66 67 68 geographically the viking age covered scandinavian lands modern denmark norway and sweden as well as territories under north germanic dominance mainly the danelaw including scandinavian york the administrative centre of the remains of the kingdom of northumbria 69 parts of mercia and east anglia 70 viking navigators opened the road to new lands to the north west and east resulting in the foundation of independent settlements in the shetland orkney and faroe islands iceland greenland 71 and l anse aux meadows a short lived settlement in newfoundland circa 1000 72 the greenland settlement was established around 980 during the medieval warm period and its demise by the mid 15th century may have been partly due to climate change 73 the viking rurik dynasty took control of territories in slavic and finnic dominated areas of eastern europe they annexed kiev in 882 to serve as the capital of the kievan rus 74 as early as 839 when swedish emissaries are first known to have visited byzantium scandinavians served as mercenaries in the service of the byzantine empire 75 in the late 10th century a new unit of the imperial bodyguard formed traditionally containing large numbers of scandinavians it was known as the varangian guard the word varangian may have originated in old norse but in slavic and greek it could refer either to scandinavians or franks in these years swedish men left to enlist in the byzantine varangian guard in such numbers that a medieval swedish law the västgötalagen from västergötland declared no one could inherit while staying in greece the then scandinavian term for the byzantine empire to stop the emigration 76 especially as two other european courts simultaneously also recruited scandinavians 77 kievan rus c 980 1060 and london 1018 1066 the þingalið 77 there is archaeological evidence that vikings reached

homelands in denmark norway and sweden the norsemen settled in the present day faroe islands iceland norse greenland newfoundland the netherlands germany normandy italy scotland england wales ireland the isle of man estonia ukraine russia and turkey as well as initiating the consolidation that resulted in the formation of the present day scandinavian countries in the viking age the present day nations of norway sweden and denmark did not exist but were largely homogeneous and similar in culture and language although somewhat distinct geographically the names of scandinavian kings are reliably known for only the later part of the viking age after the end of the viking age the separate kingdoms gradually acquired distinct identities as nations which went hand in hand with their christianisation thus the end of the viking age for the scandinavians also marks the start of their relatively brief middle ages intermixing with the slavs slavic and viking tribes were closely linked fighting one another intermixing and trading 79 80 81 in the middle ages ware was transferred from slavic areas to scandinavia and denmark could be considered a melting pot of slavic and scandinavian elements 79 it is argued that the presence of slavs in scandinavia is more significant than previously thought 79 although the slavs and their interaction with scandinavia have not been adequately investigated 82 a 10th century grave of a warrior woman in denmark was long thought to belong to a viking however new analyses suggest that the woman may have been a slav from present day poland 79 the first king of the swedes eric was married to gunhild of the polish house of piast 83 likewise his son olof fell in love with edla a slavic woman and took her as his frilla concubine 84 they had a son and a daughter emund the old king of sweden and astrid queen of norway cnut the great king of denmark england and norway was the son of a daughter of mieszko i of poland 85 possibly the former polish queen of sweden wife of eric richeza of poland queen of sweden married magnus the strong and they had several children including canute v king of denmark 86 catherine jagiellon of the house of jagiellon was married to john iii king of sweden she was the mother of sigismund iii vasa king of poland king of sweden and grand duke of finland 87 ragnvald ulfsson son of jarl ulf tostesson and the wendic princess ingeborg had a slavic name rogvolod from old east slavic рогволод 88 expansion main article viking expansion viking expeditions blue line depicting the immense breadth of their voyages

of the franks to rollo in 911 but upper normandy guests from overseas 1901 by nicholas roerich depicting a varangian raid colonisation of iceland by norwegian vikings began in the ninth century the first source mentioning iceland and greenland is a papal letter of 1053 twenty years later they appear in the gesta of adam of bremen it was not until after 1130 when the islands had become christianized that accounts of the history of the islands were written from the point of view of the inhabitants in sagas and chronicles 89 the vikings explored the northern islands and coasts of the north atlantic ventured south to north africa east to kievan rus now ukraine belarus constantinople and the middle east 90 they raided and pillaged traded acted as mercenaries and settled colonies over a wide area 91 early vikings probably returned home after their raids later in their history they began to settle in other lands 92 vikings under leif erikson heir to erik the red reached north america and set up short lived settlements in present day l anse aux meadows newfoundland canada this expansion occurred during the medieval warm period 93 viking expansion into continental europe was limited their realm was bordered by powerful tribes to the south early on it was the saxons who occupied old saxony located in what is now northern germany the saxons were a fierce and powerful people and were often in conflict with the vikings to counter the saxon aggression and solidify their own presence the danes constructed the huge defence fortification of danevirke in and around hedeby 94 the vikings witnessed the violent subduing of the saxons by charlemagne in the thirty year saxon wars of 772 804 the saxon defeat resulted in their forced christening and the absorption of old saxony into the carolingian empire fear of the franks led the vikings to further expand danevirke and the defence constructions remained in use throughout the viking age and even up until 1864 95 the south coast of the baltic sea was ruled by the obotrites a federation of slavic tribes loyal to the carolingians and later the frankish empire the vikings led by king gudfred destroyed the obotrite city of reric on the southern baltic coast in 808 ad and transferred the merchants and traders to hedeby 96 this secured viking supremacy in the baltic sea which continued throughout the viking age because of the expansion of the vikings across europe a comparison of dna and archeology undertaken by scientists at the university of cambridge and university of copenhagen suggested that the term viking may have evolved to become a job description not a matter of heredity at least in some viking bands 97 motives the motives driving the viking expansion are a topic of much debate in nordic history researchers have suggested that vikings may have originally started sailing and raiding due to a need to seek out women from foreign lands 98 99 100 101 the concept was expressed in the 11th century by historian dudo of saint quentin in his semi imaginary history of the normans 102 rich and powerful viking men tended to have many wives and concubines these polygynous relationships may have led to a shortage of eligible women for the average viking male due to this the average viking man could have been forced to perform riskier actions to gain wealth and power to be able to find suitable women 103 104 105 viking men would often buy or capture women and make them into their wives or concubines 106 107 polygynous marriage increases male male competition in society because it creates a pool of unmarried men who are willing to engage in risky status elevating and sex seeking behaviors 108 109 the annals of ulster states that in 821 the vikings plundered an irish village and carried off a great number of women into captivity 110 one common theory posits that charlemagne used force and terror to christianise all pagans leading to baptism conversion or execution and as a result vikings and other pagans resisted and wanted revenge 111 112 113 114 115 professor rudolf simek states that it is not a coincidence if the early viking activity occurred during the reign of charlemagne 111 116 the ascendance of christianity in scandinavia led to serious conflict dividing norway for almost a century however this time period did not commence until the 10th century norway was never subject to aggression by charlemagne and the period of strife was due to successive norwegian kings embracing christianity after encountering it overseas 117 viking era towns of scandinavia another explanation is that the vikings exploited a moment of weakness in the surrounding regions contrary to simek s assertion viking raids occurred sporadically long before the reign of charlemagne but exploded in frequency and size after his death when his empire fragmented into multiple much weaker entities 118 england suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers lack of organised naval opposition throughout western europe allowed viking ships to travel freely raiding or trading as opportunity permitted the decline in the profitability of old trade routes could also have played a role trade between western europe and the rest of eurasia suffered a severe blow when the western roman empire fell in the 5th century 119 the expansion of islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with western europe 120 raids in europe including raids and settlements from scandinavia were not unprecedented and had occurred long before the vikings arrived the jutes invaded the british isles three centuries earlier pouring out from jutland during the age of migrations before the danes settled there the saxons and the angles did the same embarking from mainland europe the viking raids were however the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times 118 vikings themselves were expanding although their motives are unclear historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor 121 the highway of slaves was a term for a route that the vikings found to have a direct pathway from scandinavia to constantinople and baghdad while traveling on the baltic sea with the advancements of their ships during the ninth century the vikings were able to sail to kievan rus and some northern parts of europe 122 jomsborg curmsun disc obverse jomsborg 980s jomsborg was a semi legendary viking stronghold at the southern coast of the baltic sea medieval wendland modern pomerania that existed between the 960s and 1043 its inhabitants were known as jomsvikings jomsborg s exact location or its existence has not yet been established though it is often maintained that jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the oder estuary 123 end of the viking age while the vikings were active beyond their scandinavian homelands scandinavia was itself experiencing new influences and undergoing a variety of cultural changes 124 emergence of nation states and monetary economies by the late 11th century royal dynasties were legitimised by the catholic church which had had little influence in scandinavia 300 years earlier which were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition with the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden taking shape towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites and monetary economies began to emerge based on english and german models 125 by this time the influx of islamic silver from the east had been absent for more than a century and the flow of english silver had come to an end in the mid 11th century 126 assimilation into christendom christianity had taken root in denmark and norway with the establishment of dioceses in the 11th century and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in sweden foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of christianity which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming by 1103 the first archbishopric was founded in scandinavia at lund scania then part of denmark the assimilation of the nascent scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of european christendom altered the aspirations of scandinavian rulers and of scandinavians able to travel overseas and changed their relations with their neighbours one of the primary sources of profit for the vikings had been slave taking from other european peoples the medieval church held that christians should not own fellow christians as slaves so chattel slavery diminished as a practice throughout northern europe this took much of the economic incentive out of raiding though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century scandinavian predation in christian lands around the north and irish seas diminished markedly the kings of norway continued to assert power in parts of northern britain and ireland and raids continued into the 12th century but the military ambitions of scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths in 1107 sigurd i of norway sailed for the eastern mediterranean with norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established kingdom of jerusalem the kings of denmark and sweden participated actively in the baltic crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries 127 culture a variety of sources illuminate the culture activities and beliefs of the vikings although they were generally a non literate culture that produced no literary legacy they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on runestones most contemporary literary and written sources on the vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them 128 since the mid 20th century archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the vikings 129 130 the archaeological record is particularly rich and varied providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement crafts and production ships and military equipment trading networks as well as their pagan and christian religious artefacts and practices literature and language see also old norse and the norse sagas one of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the heimskringla sagas written by snorri sturluson c 1230 the leaf tells of king ólafur the most important primary sources on the vikings are contemporary texts from scandinavia and regions where the vikings were active 131 writing in latin letters was introduced to scandinavia with christianity so there are few native documentary sources from scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries 132 the scandinavians did write inscriptions in runes but these are usually very short and formulaic most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in christian and islamic communities outside scandinavia often by authors who had been negatively affected by viking activity later writings on the vikings and the viking age can also be important for understanding them and their culture although they need to be treated cautiously after the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval christian culture in the 11th and 12th centuries native written sources begin to appear in latin and old norse in the viking colony of iceland an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries and many traditions connected with the viking age were written down for the first time in the icelandic sagas a literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the vikings and the scandinavian past is doubtful but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration such as the great quantity of skaldic poetry attributed to court poets of the 10th and 11th centuries the exposed family trees the self images the ethical values that are contained in these literary writings indirectly the vikings have also left a window open onto their language culture and activities through many old norse place names and words found in their former sphere of influence some of these place names and words are still in direct use today almost unchanged and shed light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them examples include place names like egilsay from eigils ey meaning eigil s island ormskirk from ormr kirkja meaning orms church or church of the worm meols from merl meaning sand dunes snaefell snow fell ravenscar ravens rock vinland land of wine or land of winberry kaupanger market harbour tórshavn thor s harbour and the religious centre of odense meaning a place where odin was worshipped viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present day parliamentary body of the tynwald on the isle of man common words in everyday english language such as leg skin dirt sky egg kid anger window husband knife bag gift glove guest wing birth law gate scab skirt root skull reindeer happy wrong ugly low weak loose want give take get smile guess seem hit kick scare crawl call lift both they them and their stem from the old norse of the vikings and give an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the british isles 133 in the northern isles of shetland and orkney old norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct norn language some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records such as york horse bay swansea sveinn s isle or some of the place names in normandy like tocqueville toki s farm 134 linguistic and etymological studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the viking culture their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met traded attacked or lived with in overseas settlements 135 136 a lot of old norse connections are evident in the modern day languages of swedish norwegian danish faroese and icelandic 137 old norse did not exert any great influence on the slavic languages in the viking settlements of eastern europe it has been speculated that the reason for this was the great differences between the two languages combined with the rus vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered the norse named some of the rapids on the dnieper but this can hardly be seen from the modern names 138 139 runestones main article runestone the lingsberg runestone in swedenrunic inscriptions of the larger of the jelling stones in denmarktwo types of norse runestones from the viking age the norse of the viking age could read and write and used a non standardised alphabet called runor built upon sound values while there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the viking era thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where vikings lived they are usually in memory of the dead though not necessarily placed at graves the use of runor survived into the 15th century used in parallel with the latin alphabet the runestones are unevenly distributed in scandinavia denmark has 250 runestones norway has 50 while iceland has none 140 sweden has as many as between 1 700 140 and 2 500 141 depending on definition the swedish district of uppland has the highest concentration with as many as 1 196 inscriptions in stone whereas södermanland is second with 391 142 143 the majority of runic inscriptions from the viking period are found in sweden many runestones in scandinavia record the names of participants in viking expeditions such as the kjula runestone that tells of extensive warfare in western europe and the turinge runestone which tells of a war band in eastern europe other runestones mention men who died on viking expeditions among them include the england runestones swedish englandsstenarna which is a group of about 30 runestones in sweden which refer to viking age voyages to england they constitute one of the largest groups of runestones that mention voyages to other countries and they are comparable in number only to the approximately 30 greece runestones 144 and the 26 ingvar runestones the latter referring to a viking expedition to the middle east 145 they were engraved in old norse with the younger futhark 146 piraeus lion drawing of curved lindworm the runes on the lion tell of swedish warriors most likely varangians mercenaries in the service of the byzantine eastern roman emperor the jelling stones date from between 960 and 985 the older smaller stone was raised by king gorm the old the last pagan king of denmark as a memorial honouring queen thyre 147 the larger stone was raised by his son harald bluetooth to celebrate the conquest of denmark and norway and the conversion of the danes to christianity it has three sides one with an animal image one with an image of the crucified jesus christ and a third bearing the following inscription king haraldr ordered this monument made in memory of gormr his father and in memory of thyrvé his mother that haraldr who won for himself all of denmark and norway and made the danes christian 148 runestones attest to voyages to locations such as bath 149 greece how the vikings referred to the byzantium territories generally 150 khwaresm 151

on the manx runestones on the isle of man runic alphabet usage in modern times the last known people to use the runic alphabet were an isolated group of people known as the elfdalians that lived in the locality of älvdalen in the swedish province of dalarna they spoke the language of elfdalian the language unique to älvdalen the elfdalian language differentiates itself from the other scandinavian languages as it evolved much closer to old norse the people of älvdalen stopped using runes as late as the 1920s usage of runes therefore survived longer in älvdalen than anywhere else in the world 158 the last known record of the elfdalian runes is from 1929 they are a variant of the dalecarlian runes runic inscriptions that were also found in dalarna traditionally regarded as a swedish dialect 159 but by several criteria closer related to west scandinavian dialects 160 elfdalian is a separate language by the standard of mutual intelligibility 161 162 163 although there is no mutual intelligibility due to schools and public administration in älvdalen being conducted in swedish native speakers are bilingual and speak swedish at a native level residents in the area who speak only swedish as their sole native language neither speaking nor understanding elfdalian are also common älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century today there are about 2 000 3000 native speakers of elfdalian burial sites see also norse funeral and ship burial burial mounds gamla uppsala funerary stone settings lindholm høje examples of viking burial mounds and stone set graves collectively known as tumuli there are numerous burial sites associated with vikings throughout europe and their sphere of influence in scandinavia the british isles ireland greenland iceland faeroe islands germany latvia estonia finland russia etc the burial practices of the vikings were quite varied from dug graves in the ground to tumuli sometimes including so called ship burials according to written sources most of the funerals took place at sea the funerals involved either burial or cremation depending on local customs in the area that is now sweden cremations were predominant in denmark burial was more common and in norway both were common 164 viking barrows are one of the primary source of evidence for circumstances in the viking age 165 the items buried with the dead give some indication as to what was considered important to possess in the afterlife 166 it is unknown what mortuary services were given to dead children by the vikings 167 some of the

at oslo museum there have been several archaeological finds of viking ships of all sizes providing knowledge of the craftsmanship that went into building them there were many types of viking ships built for various uses the best known type is probably the longship 174 longships were intended for warfare and exploration designed for speed and agility and were equipped with oars to complement the sail making navigation possible independently of the wind the longship had a long narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water longships were used extensively by the leidang the scandinavian defence fleets the longship allowed the norse to go viking which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of vikings 175 176 the vikings built many unique types of watercraft often used for more peaceful tasks the knarr was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk it had a broader hull deeper draught and a small number of oars used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations one viking innovation was the beitass a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind 177 it was common for seafaring viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore a reconstructed longshipa model of the knarr ship typetwo typical viking ships ships were an integral part of the viking culture they facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways exploration of new lands raids conquests and trade with neighbouring cultures they also held a major religious importance people with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices weapons provisions and other items as evidenced by the buried vessels at gokstad and oseberg in norway 178 and the excavated ship burial at ladby in denmark ship burials were also practised by vikings overseas as evidenced by the excavations of the salme ships on the estonian island of saaremaa 179 well preserved remains of five viking ships were excavated from roskilde fjord in the late 1960s representing both the longship and the knarr the ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect roskilde then the danish capital from seaborne assault the remains of these ships are on display at the viking ship museum in roskilde in 2019 archaeologists uncovered two viking boat graves in gamla uppsala they also discovered that one of the boats still holds the remains of a man a dog and a horse along with other items 180 this has shed light on death rituals of viking communities in the region everyday life social structure a large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at lofotr viking museum norway reconstructed town houses from haithabu now in germany viking society was divided into the three socio economic classes thralls karls and jarls this is described vividly in the eddic poem of rígsþula which also explains that it was the god ríg father of mankind also known as heimdallr who created the three classes archaeology has confirmed this social structure 181 thralls were the lowest ranking class and were slaves slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population 182 slavery was of vital importance to viking society for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the karls and jarls and they were used for constructing fortifications ramps canals mounds roads and similar hard work projects according to the rigsthula thralls were despised and looked down upon new thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or captured abroad the vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in europe to enslave them as thralls the thralls were then brought back home to scandinavia by boat used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures or sold often to the arabs in exchange for silver other names for thrall were træl and ty karls were free peasants they owned farms land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields milking the cattle building houses and wagons but used thralls to make ends meet other names for karls were bonde or simply free men similar classes were churls and huskarls the jarls were the aristocracy of the viking society they were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses horses and many thralls the thralls did most of the daily chores while the jarls did administration politics hunting sports visited other jarls or went abroad on expeditions when a jarl died and was buried his household thralls were sometimes sacrificially killed and buried next to him as many excavations have revealed 183 in daily life there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility these details are unclear but titles and positions like hauldr thegn landmand show mobility between the karls and the jarls other social structures included the communities of félag in both the civil and the military spheres to which its members called félagi were obliged a félag could be centred around certain trades a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader members of the latter were referred to as drenge one of the words for warrior there were also official communities within towns and villages the overall defence religion the legal system and the things status of women typical jewellery worn by women of the karls and jarls ornamented silver brooches coloured glass beads and amulets like elsewhere in medieval europe most women in viking society were subordinate to their husbands and fathers and had little political power 184 185 however the written sources portray free viking women as having independence and rights viking women generally appear to have had more freedom than women elsewhere 185 as illustrated in the icelandic grágás and the norwegian frostating laws and gulating laws 186 most free viking women were housewives and the woman s standing in society was linked to that of her husband 185 marriage gave a woman a degree of economic security and social standing encapsulated in the title húsfreyja lady of the house norse laws assert the housewife s authority over the indoor household she had the important roles of managing the farm s resources conducting business as well as child rearing although some of this would be shared with her husband 187 after the age of 20 an unmarried woman referred to as maer and mey reached legal majority and had the right to decide her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law 186 an exception to her independence was the right to choose a husband as marriages were normally arranged by the family 188 the groom would pay a bride price mundr to the bride s family and the bride brought assets into the marriage as a dowry 187 a married woman could divorce her husband and remarry 185 189 concubinage was also part of viking society whereby a woman could live with a man and have children with him without marrying such a woman was called a frilla 189 usually she would be the mistress of a wealthy and powerful man who also had a wife 184 the wife had authority over the mistresses if they lived in her household 185 through her relationship to a man of higher social standing a concubine and her family could advance socially although her position was less secure than that of a wife 184 there was little distinction made between children born inside or outside marriage both had the right to inherit property from their parents and there were no legitimate or illegitimate children 189 however children born in wedlock had more inheritance rights than those born out of wedlock 187 a woman had the right to inherit part of her husband s property upon his death 187 and widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women 189 the paternal aunt paternal niece and paternal granddaughter referred to as odalkvinna all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man 186 a woman with no husband sons or male relatives could inherit not only property but also the position as head of the family when her father or brother died such a woman was referred to as baugrygr and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan until she married by which her rights were transferred to her new husband 186 women had religious authority and were active as priestesses gydja and oracles sejdkvinna 190 they were active within art as poets skalder 190 and rune masters and as merchants and medicine women 190 there may also have been female entrepreneurs who worked in textile production 185 women may also have been active within military office the tales about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed but some archaeological finds such as the birka female viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed 191 these liberties of the viking women gradually disappeared after the introduction of christianity 192 and from the late 13th century they are no longer mentioned 186 examinations of viking age burials suggests that women lived longer and nearly all well past the age of 35 as compared to earlier times female graves from before the viking age in scandinavia hold a proportionally large number of remains from women aged 20 to 35 presumably due to complications of childbirth 193 examinations of skeletal remains also allow us to reconstruct the relative health and nutritional status of boys and girls in the past using anthropometric techniques burials from scandinavia and other european countries suggests that in comparison with other societies at the time female equality was remarkably high in rural scandinavia females in the rural periphery of nordic countries during the viking period and the later middle ages had relatively high status resulting in substantial nutritional and health resources being allocated to girls enabling them to grow stronger and healthier 194 appearance reconstructed vikings costume on display at archaeological museum in stavanger norway scandinavian vikings were similar in appearance to modern scandinavians their skin was fair and the hair color varied between blond dark and reddish genetic studies suggest that people were mostly blond in what is now eastern sweden while red hair was mostly found in western scandinavia 195 most viking men had shoulder length hair and beards and slaves thralls were usually the only men with short hair 196 the length varied according to personal preference and occupation men involved in warfare for example may have had slightly shorter hair and beards for practical reasons men in some regions bleached their hair a golden saffron color 196 females also had long hair with girls often wearing it loose or braided and married women often wearing it in a bun 196 the average height is estimated to have been 1 70 m 5 ft 7 in for men and 1 55 m 5 ft 1 in for women 195 the three classes were easily recognisable by their appearance men and women of the jarls were well groomed with neat hairstyles and expressed their wealth and status by wearing expensive clothes often silk and well crafted jewellery like brooches belt buckles necklaces and arm rings almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the norse see viking art finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all as they were seen as a slavic phenomenon most karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way 181 197 archaeological finds from scandinavia and viking settlements in the british isles support the idea of the well groomed and hygienic viking burial with grave goods was a common practice in the scandinavian world through the viking age and well past the christianization of the norse peoples 198 within these burial sites and homesteads combs often made from antler are a common find 199 the manufacturing of such antler combs was common as at the viking settlement at dublin hundreds of examples of combs from the tenth century have survived suggesting that grooming was a common practice 200 the manufacturing of such combs was also widespread throughout the viking world as examples of similar combs have been found at viking settlements in ireland 201 england 202 and scotland 203 the combs share a common visual appearance as well with the extant examples often decorated with linear interlacing and geometric motifs or other forms of ornamentation depending on the comb s period and type but stylistically similar to viking age art 204 the practice of grooming was a concern for all levels of viking age society as grooming products combs have been found in common graves as well as aristocratic ones 205 farming and cuisine the sagas tell about the diet and cuisine of the vikings 206 but first hand evidence like cesspits kitchen middens and garbage dumps have proved to be of great value and importance undigested remains of plants from cesspits at coppergate in york have provided much information in this respect overall archaeo botanical investigations have been undertaken increasingly in recent decades as a collaboration between archaeologists and palaeoethno botanists this new approach sheds light on the agricultural and horticultural practices of the vikings and their cuisine 207 pot of soapstone partly reconstructed viking age from birka sweden the combined information from various sources suggests a diverse cuisine and ingredients meat products of all kinds such as cured smoked and whey preserved meat 208 sausages and boiled or fried fresh meat cuts were prepared and consumed 209 there were plenty of seafood bread porridges dairy products vegetables fruits berries and nuts alcoholic drinks like beer mead bjórr a strong fruit wine and for the rich imported wine were served 210 211 certain livestock were typical and unique to the vikings including the icelandic horse icelandic cattle a plethora of sheep breeds 212 the danish hen and the danish goose 213 214 the vikings in york mostly ate beef mutton and pork with small amounts of horse meat most of the beef and horse leg bones were found split lengthways to extract the marrow the mutton and swine were cut into leg and shoulder joints and chops the frequent remains of pig skull and foot bones found on house floors indicate that brawn and trotters were also popular hens were kept for both their meat and eggs and the bones of game birds such as black grouse golden plover wild ducks and geese have also been found 215 seafood was important in some places even more so than meat whales and walrus were hunted for food in norway and the northwestern parts of the north atlantic region and seals were hunted nearly everywhere oysters mussels and shrimp were eaten in large quantities and cod and salmon were popular fish in the southern regions herring was also important 216 217 218 milk and buttermilk were popular both as cooking ingredients and drinks but were not always available even at farms 219 milk came from cows goats and sheep with priorities varying from location to location 220 and fermented milk products like skyr or surmjölk were produced as well as butter and cheese 221 food was often salted and enhanced with spices some of which were imported like black pepper while others were cultivated in herb gardens or harvested in the wild home grown spices included caraway mustard and horseradish as evidenced from the oseberg ship burial 210 or dill coriander and wild celery as found in cesspits at coppergate in york thyme juniper berry sweet gale yarrow rue and peppercress were also used and cultivated in herb gardens 207 222 everyday life in the viking age vikings collected and ate fruits berries and nuts apple wild crab apples plums and cherries were part of the diet 223 as were rose hips and raspberry wild strawberry blackberry elderberry rowan hawthorn and various wild berries specific to the locations 222 hazelnuts were an important part of the diet in general and large amounts of walnut shells have been found in cities like hedeby the shells were used for dyeing and it is assumed that the nuts were consumed 207 219 the invention and introduction of the mouldboard plough revolutionised agriculture in scandinavia in the early viking age and made it possible to farm even poor soils in ribe grains of rye barley oat and wheat dated to the 8th century have been found and examined and are believed to have been cultivated locally 224 grains and flour were used for making porridges some cooked with milk some cooked with fruit and sweetened with honey and also various forms of bread remains of bread from primarily birka in sweden were made of barley and wheat it is unclear if the norse leavened their breads but their ovens and baking utensils suggest that they did 225 flax was a very important crop for the vikings it was used for oil extraction food consumption and most importantly the production of linen more than 40 of all known textile recoveries from the viking age can be traced as linen this suggests a much higher actual percentage as linen is poorly preserved compared to wool for example 226 the quality of food for common people was not always particularly high the research at coppergate shows that the vikings in york made bread from whole meal flour probably both wheat and rye but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included corncockle agrostemma would have made the bread dark coloured but the seeds are poisonous and people who ate the bread might have become ill seeds of carrots parsnip and brassicas were also discovered but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages 223 the rotary querns often used in the viking age left tiny stone fragments often from basalt rock in the flour which when eaten wore down the teeth the effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains of that period 225 sports sports were widely practised and encouraged by the vikings 227 228 sports that involved weapons training and developing combat skills were popular this included spear and stone throwing building and testing physical strength through wrestling see glima fist fighting and stone lifting in areas with mountains mountain climbing was practised as a sport agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship s railing as it was being rowed 229 swimming was a popular sport and snorri sturluson describes three types diving long distance swimming and a contest in which two swimmers try to dunk one another children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers although it is unclear if they took part in competition king olaf tryggvason was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar jumping and was said to have excelled in the art of knife juggling as well skiing and ice skating were the primary winter sports of the vikings although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north horse fighting was practised for sport although the rules are unclear it appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other within smell and sight of fenced off mares whatever the rules were the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions icelandic sources refer to the sport of knattleik a ball game akin to hockey knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice the rules are unclear but it was popular with both adults and children even though it often led to injuries knattleik appears to have been played only in iceland where it attracted many spectators as did horse fighting hunting as a sport was limited to denmark where it was not regarded as an important occupation birds deer hares and foxes were hunted with bow and spear and later with crossbows the techniques were stalking snare and traps and par force hunting with dog packs games and entertainment rook lewis chessmen at the national museum of scotland both archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings 227 228 230 board games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society preserved gaming pieces and boards show game boards made of easily available materials like wood with game pieces manufactured from stone wood or bone while other finds include elaborately carved boards and game pieces of glass amber antler or walrus tusk together with materials of foreign origin such as ivory the vikings played several types of tafl games hnefatafl nitavl nine men s morris and the less common kvatrutafl chess also appeared at the end of the viking age hnefatafl is a war game in which the object is to capture the king piece a large hostile army threatens and the king s men have to protect the king it was played on a board with squares using black and white pieces with moves made according to dice rolls the ockelbo runestone shows two men engaged in hnefatafl and the sagas suggest that money or valuables could have been involved in some dice games 227 230 on festive occasions storytelling skaldic poetry music and alcoholic drinks like beer and mead contributed to the atmosphere 230 music was considered an art form and music proficiency as fitting for a cultivated man the vikings are known to have played instruments including harps fiddles lyres and lutes 227 experimental archaeology experimental archaeology of the viking age is a flourishing branch and several places have been dedicated to this technique such as jorvik viking centre in the united kingdom sagnlandet lejre and ribe viking center da in denmark foteviken museum in sweden or lofotr viking museum in norway viking age reenactors have undertaken experimental activities such as iron smelting and forging using norse techniques at norstead in newfoundland for example 231 on 1 july 2007 the reconstructed viking ship skuldelev 2 renamed sea stallion 232 began a journey from roskilde to dublin the remains of that ship and four others were discovered

to its home and sea stallion arrived outside dublin s custom house on 14 august 2007 the purpose of the voyage was to test and document the seaworthiness speed and manoeuvrability of the ship on the rough open sea and in coastal waters with treacherous currents the crew tested how the long narrow flexible hull withstood the tough ocean waves the expedition also provided valuable new information on viking longships and society the ship was built using viking tools materials and much the same methods as the original ship other vessels often replicas of the gokstad ship full or half scale or

practices were maintained in settler societies but they could be quite distinct as the groups assimilated into the neighboring societies assimilation to the frankish culture in normandy for example was rapid 234 links to a viking identity remained longer in the remote islands of iceland and the faroes 234 weapons and warfare main article viking age arms and armour viking swords knowledge about the arms and armour of the viking age is based on archaeological finds pictorial representation and to some extent on the accounts in the norse sagas and norse laws recorded in the 13th century according to custom all free norse men were required to own weapons and were permitted to carry them at all times these arms indicated a viking s social status a wealthy viking had a complete ensemble of a helmet shield mail shirt and sword however swords were rarely used in battle probably not sturdy enough for combat and most likely only used as symbolic or decorative items 235 236 a typical bóndi freeman was more likely to fight with a spear and shield and most also carried a seax as a utility knife and side arm bows were used in the opening stages of land battles and at sea but they tended to be considered less honourable than melee weapons vikings were relatively unusual for the time in their use of axes as a main battle weapon the húscarls the elite guard of king cnut and later of king harold ii were armed with two handed axes that could split shields or metal helmets with ease the warfare and violence of the vikings were often motivated and fuelled by their beliefs in norse religion focusing on thor and odin the gods of war and death 237 238 in combat it is believed that the vikings sometimes engaged in a disordered style of frenetic furious fighting known as berserkergang leading them to be termed berserkers such tactics may have been deployed intentionally by shock troops and the berserk state may have been induced through ingestion of materials with psychoactive properties such as the hyoscyamus niger 239 hallucinogenic mushroom amanita muscaria 240 or large amounts of alcohol 241 trade see also trade during the viking age trade route from the varangians to the greeks and volga trade route the scales and weights of a viking trader used for measuring silver and sometimes gold from the sigtuna box found in sweden the vikings established and engaged in extensive trading networks throughout the known world and had a profound influence on the economic development of europe and scandinavia 242 243 except for the major trading centres of ribe hedeby and the like the viking world was unfamiliar with the use of coinage and was based on so called bullion economy that is the weight of precious metals silver was the most common metal in the economy although gold was also used to some extent silver circulated in the form of bars or ingots as well as in the form of jewellery and ornaments a large number of silver hoards from the viking age have been uncovered both in scandinavia and the lands they settled 244 better source needed traders carried small scales enabling them to measure weight very accurately so it was possible to have a very precise system of trade and exchange even without a regular coinage 242 goods organized trade covered everything from ordinary items in bulk to exotic luxury products the viking ship designs like that of the knarr were an important factor in their success as merchants 245 imported goods from other cultures included 246 spices were obtained from chinese and persian traders who met with the viking traders in russia vikings used homegrown spices and herbs like caraway thyme horseradish and mustard 247 but imported cinnamon glass was much prized by the norse the imported glass was often made into beads for decoration and these have been found in the thousands åhus in scania and the old market town of ribe were major centres of glass bead production 248 249 250 silk was a very important commodity obtained from byzantium modern day istanbul and china it was valued by many european cultures of the time and the vikings used it to indicate status such as wealth and nobility many of the archaeological finds in scandinavia include silk 251 252 253 wine was imported from france and germany as a drink of the wealthy augmenting the regular mead and beer to counter these valuable imports the vikings exported a large variety of goods these goods included 246 mjölnir hammer of thor made of amber found in sweden amber the fossilised resin of the pine tree was frequently found on the north sea and baltic coastline it was worked into beads and ornamental objects before being traded see also the amber road fur was also exported as it provided warmth this included the furs of pine martens foxes bears otters and beavers cloth and wool the vikings were skilled spinners and weavers and exported woollen cloth of a high quality down was collected and exported the norwegian west coast supplied eiderdowns and sometimes feathers were bought from the samis down was used for bedding and quilted clothing fowling on the steep slopes and cliffs was dangerous work and was often lethal 254 slaves known as thralls in old norse on their raids the vikings captured many people among them monks and clergymen they were sometimes sold as slaves to arab merchants in exchange for silver other exports included weapons walrus ivory wax salt and cod as one of the more exotic exports hunting birds were sometimes provided from norway to the european aristocracy from the 10th century 254 many of these goods were also traded within the viking world itself as well as goods such as soapstone and whetstone soapstone was traded with the norse on iceland and in jutland who used it for pottery whetstones were traded and used for sharpening weapons tools and knives 246 there are indications from ribe and surrounding areas that the extensive medieval trade with oxen and cattle from jutland see ox road reach as far back as c 720 ad this trade satisfied the vikings need for leather and meat to some extent and perhaps hides for parchment production on the european mainland wool was also very important as a domestic product for the vikings to produce warm clothing for the cold scandinavian and nordic climate and for sails sails for viking ships required large amounts of wool as evidenced by experimental archaeology there are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in scandinavia reaching as far back as the early iron ages artisans and craftsmen in the larger towns were supplied with antlers from organised hunting with large scale reindeer traps in the far north they were used as raw material for making everyday utensils like combs 254 legacy medieval perceptions exploration and expansion routes of norsemen in england the viking age began dramatically on 8 june 793 when norsemen destroyed the abbey on the island of lindisfarne the devastation of northumbria s holy island shocked and alerted the royal courts of europe to the viking presence never before has such an atrocity been seen declared the northumbrian scholar alcuin of york 255 medieval christians in europe were totally unprepared for the viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the wrath of god 256 more than any other single event the attack on lindisfarne demonised perception of the vikings for the next twelve centuries not until the 1890s did scholars outside scandinavia begin to seriously reassess the achievements of the vikings recognizing their artistry technological skills and seamanship 257 norse mythology sagas and literature tell of scandinavian culture and religion through tales of heroic and mythological heroes early transmission of this information was primarily oral and later texts relied on the writings and transcriptions of christian scholars including the icelanders snorri sturluson and sæmundur fróði many of these sagas were written in iceland and most of them even if they had no icelandic provenance were preserved there after the middle ages due to the continued interest of icelanders in norse literature and law codes the 200 year viking influence on european history is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation and the majority of these chronicles came from western european witnesses and their descendants less common though equally relevant are references to vikings in chronicles that originated in the east including the nestor chronicles novgorod chronicles ibn fadlan chronicles ibn rusta chronicles and brief mentions by photius patriarch of constantinople regarding the first viking attack on the byzantine empire other chroniclers of viking history include adam of bremen who wrote in the fourth volume of his gesta hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum t here is much gold here in zealand accumulated by piracy these pirates which are called wichingi by their own people and ascomanni by our own people pay tribute to the danish king in 991 the battle of maldon between viking raiders and the inhabitants of maldon in essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name post medieval perceptions a modern reenactment of a viking battle early modern publications dealing with what is now called viking culture appeared in the 16th century e g historia de gentibus septentrionalibus history of the northern people of olaus magnus 1555 and the first edition of the 13th century gesta danorum deeds of the danes by saxo grammaticus in 1514 the pace of publication increased during the 17th century with latin translations of the edda notably peder resen s edda islandorum of 1665 in scandinavia the 17th century danish scholars thomas bartholin and ole worm and the swede olaus rudbeck used runic inscriptions and icelandic sagas as historical sources an important early british contributor to the study of the vikings was george hickes who published his linguarum vett septentrionalium thesaurus dictionary of the old northern languages in 1703 05 during the 18th century british interest and enthusiasm for iceland and early scandinavian culture grew dramatically expressed in english translations of old norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed viking virtues the word viking was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by erik gustaf geijer in his poem the viking geijer s poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the viking which had little basis in historical fact the renewed interest of romanticism in the old north had contemporary political implications the geatish society of which geijer was a member popularised this myth to a great extent another swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the vikings was esaias tegnér a member of the geatish society who wrote a modern version of friðþjófs saga hins frœkna which became widely popular in the nordic countries the united kingdom and germany viking long ships besieging paris in 845 19th century portrayal fascination with the vikings reached a peak during the so called viking revival in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of romantic nationalism in britain this was called septentrionalism in germany wagnerian pathos and in the scandinavian countries scandinavism pioneering 19th century scholarly editions of the viking age began to reach a small readership in britain archaeologists began to dig up britain s viking past and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the viking age origins of rural idioms and proverbs the new dictionaries of the old norse language enabled the victorians to grapple with the primary icelandic sagas 258 until recently the history of the viking age was largely based on icelandic sagas the history of the danes written by saxo grammaticus the russian primary chronicle and cogad gáedel re gallaib few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources as historians now rely more on archaeology and numismatics disciplines that have made valuable contributions toward understanding the period 259 citation needed in 20th century politics the romanticised idea of the vikings constructed in scholarly and popular circles in northwestern europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries was a potent one and the figure of the viking became a familiar and malleable symbol in different contexts in the politics and political ideologies of 20th century europe 260 in normandy which had been settled by vikings the viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol in germany awareness of viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with denmark over schleswig holstein and the use of scandinavian mythology by richard wagner the idealised view of the vikings appealed to germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the viking in accordance with the ideology of a germanic master race 261 building on the linguistic and cultural connections between norse speaking scandinavians and other germanic groups in the distant past scandinavian vikings were portrayed in nazi germany as a pure germanic type the cultural phenomenon of viking expansion was re interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the third reich and ideologically informed interpretations of viking paganism and the scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of nazi mysticism other political organisations of the same ilk such as the former norwegian fascist party nasjonal samling similarly appropriated elements of the modern viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda soviet and earlier slavophile historians emphasized a slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the normanist theory of the vikings conquering the slavs and founding the kievan rus 262 they accused normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the slavs as undeveloped primitives in contrast soviet historians stated that the slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the norman viking raids while the norman viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the slavs they argued that rus composition was slavic and that rurik and oleg

misconceptions horned helmets main article horned helmet magnus barelegs viking festival apart from two or three representations of ritual helmets with protrusions that may be either stylised ravens snakes or horns no depiction of the helmets of viking warriors and no preserved helmet has horns the formal close quarters style of viking combat either in shield walls or aboard ship islands would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior s own side historians therefore believe that viking warriors did not wear horned helmets whether such helmets were used in scandinavian culture for other ritual purposes remains unproven the general misconception that viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th century enthusiasts of götiska förbundet founded in 1811 in stockholm 277 they promoted the use of norse mythology as the subject of high art and other ethnological and moral aims the vikings were often depicted with winged helmets and in other clothing taken from classical antiquity especially in depictions of norse gods this was done to legitimise the vikings and their mythology by associating it with the classical world which had long been idealised in european culture the latter day mythos created by national romantic ideas blended the viking age with aspects of the nordic bronze age some 2 000 years earlier horned helmets from the bronze age were shown in petroglyphs and appeared in archaeological finds see bohuslän and vikso helmets they were probably used for ceremonial purposes 278 modern viking helmets cartoons like hägar the horrible and vicky the viking and sports kits such as those of the minnesota vikings and canberra raiders have perpetuated the myth of the horned helmet 279 viking helmets were conical made from hard leather with wood and metallic reinforcement for regular troops the iron helmet with mask and mail was for the chieftains based on the previous vendel age helmets from central sweden the only original viking helmet discovered is the gjermundbu helmet found in norway this helmet is made of iron and has been dated to the 10th century 280 barbarity the image of wild haired dirty savages sometimes associated with the vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality 9 viking tendencies were often misreported and the work of adam of bremen among others told largely disputable tales of viking savagery and uncleanliness 281 use of skulls as drinking vessels there is no evidence that vikings drank out of the skulls of vanquished enemies this was a misconception based on a passage in the skaldic poem krákumál speaking of heroes drinking from ór bjúgviðum hausa branches of skulls this was a reference to drinking horns but was mistranslated in the 17th century 282 as referring to the skulls of the slain 283 genetic legacy margaryan et al 2020 analyzed 442 viking world individuals from various archaeological sites in europe 16 they were found to be closely related to modern scandinavians the y dna composition of the individuals in the study was also similar to that of modern scandinavians the most common y dna haplogroup was i1 95 samples followed by r1b 84 samples and r1a especially but not exclusively of the scandinavian r1a z284 subclade 61 samples the study showed what many historians have hypothesized that it was common for norseman settlers to marry foreign women some individuals from the study such as those found in foggia display typical scandinavian y dna haplogroups but also southern european autosomal ancestry suggesting that they were the descendants of viking settler males and local women the 5 individual samples from foggia were likely normans the same pattern of a combination of scandinavian y dna and local autosomal ancestry is seen in other samples from the study for example varangians buried near lake ladoga and vikings in england suggesting that viking men had married into local families in those places too 16 the study found evidence of a swedish influx into estonia and finland and norwegian influx into ireland iceland and greenland during the viking age however the authors commented viking age danish like ancestry in the british isles cannot be distinguished from that of the angles and saxons who migrated in the fifth to sixth centuries ad from jutland and northern germany 16 margaryan et al 2020 examined the skeletal remains of 42 individuals from the salme ship burials in estonia the skeletal remains belonged to warriors killed in battle who were later buried together with numerous valuable weapons and armour dna testing and isotope analysis revealed that the men came from central sweden 16 female descent studies show evidence of norse descent in areas closest to scandinavia such as the shetland and orkney islands 284 inhabitants of lands farther away show most norse descent in the male y chromosome lines 285 a specialised genetic and surname study in liverpool showed marked norse heritage up to 50 of males of families that lived there before the years of industrialisation and population expansion 286 high percentages of norse inheritance tracked through the r m420 haplotype were also found among males in the wirral and west lancashire 287 this was similar to the percentage of norse inheritance found among males in the orkney islands 288 recent research suggests that the celtic warrior somerled who drove the vikings out of western scotland and was the progenitor of clan donald may have been of viking descent a member of haplogroup r m420 289 margaryan et al 2020 examined an elite warrior burial from bodzia poland dated to 1010 1020 ad the cemetery in bodzia is exceptional in terms of scandinavian and kievian rus links the bodzia man sample vk157 or burial e864 i was not a simple warrior from the princely retinue but he belonged to the princely family himself his burial is the richest one in the whole cemetery moreover strontium analysis of his teeth enamel shows he was not local it is assumed that he came to poland with the prince of kiev sviatopolk the accursed and met a violent death in combat this corresponds to the events of 1018 ad when sviatopolk himself disappeared after having retreated from kiev to poland it cannot be excluded that the bodzia man was sviatopolk himself as the genealogy of the rurikids at this period is extremely sketchy and the dates of birth of many princes of this dynasty may be quite approximative the bodzia man carried haplogroup i1 s2077 and had both scandinavian ancestry and russian admixture 16 290 see

superwoman in action comics 60 1943 art by joe shuster the first appearance of superwoman in a dc comic is a story in action comics 60 3 by jerry siegel and george roussos where lois lane dreams that she has gained superpowers from a blood transfusion from superman and launches a career as superwoman 4 a 1947 superman 45 march april 1947 comic revisits the theme in a story titled lois lane superwoman in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a spell on lane making her believe she has superpowers circumstances force superman to play along with the ruse temporarily by using super speed to invisibly intervene in lane s adventures to support the illusion she briefly sports a costume modeled on superman s before the spell is broken a story from action comics has lois actually gaining superpowers from one of lex luthor s inventions and launching a short lived career as superwoman 5 later stories sporadically feature tales in which lois gains superpowers and functioned as a superwoman of sorts but all of these are like the 1951 tale temporary the powers always wear off by the end of the story a typical example of this is the turnabout powers from superman family 207 may june 1981 where the earth two lois lane gains powers from her husband the earth two superman through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant superman brings into their home the plant s death reverses the effect another example is the batman superman world s finest mini series where mr mxyzptlk briefly transforms lois into a superwoman with costume and powers at the end of all star superman 2 lois lane is presented with a formula called exo genes created by superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours and she becomes superwoman during her adventures with her new kryptonian powers 6 she is wooed by two superhumans named samson and atlas and she is captured by a time ultrasphinx her powers fade away at the end of the day her costume seems to be exactly the same as that of the anti matter universe s superwoman but in superman s colors both outfits were designed by frank quitely in other pre crisis imaginary stories set outside the main dc continuity within an alternate history or hypothetical future lois lane gains superpowers in one of these sam lane is a scientist and astrophysicist he discovers that earth s sun will go nova and obliterate the solar system sam and his wife ella place their infant daughter lois in a starship and send her to krypton within a power beam that enables ftl travel and permanently modifies the baby s molecular biology this gives lois super powers after she reaches her adopted world once there adopted and raised as kandi khan lois becomes a zookeeper s daughter in kryptonville like superman in mainstream dc continuity kandi lois establishes a superhero career and like lois and superman in the mainstream continuity supermaid and kal el fall for one another like superman in the mainstream dc continuity supermaid was also vulnerable to fragments of her perished homeworld earthite in this version of events 7 another imaginary story has clark kent and lois exchange places so that she is from krypton and kent is an ordinary human inquisitive about whether or not lois lane was krypton girl s secret identity in 2016 lois again became superwoman in the dc rebirth initiative and appeared as superwoman in the comic book series superwoman the series marks the first ongoing comic book series featuring the superwoman character in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline lois and lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the new 52 superman this results in both lois and lana becoming superwoman with lois possessing all of superman s powers while lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms lois was later seemingly killed in a similar fashion to the new 52 superman while fighting a female bizzaro luma lynai edit main article luma lynai a woman from the distant planet of staryl luma lynai wins the heart of superman just as superman derives his powers from a yellow sun luma derived her gifts of super strength and flight from an orange sun their romance does not last as luma becomes deathly ill under the rays of a yellow sun and superman cannot leave earth undefended she physically

america from the parallel world of earth three vs the justice league s world of earth one superwoman like wonder woman was an amazon and possessed similar powers of super strength and flight unlike most all other versions her golden lasso could change shape into any form she desired including a giant winged serpent the crime syndicate first came to earth one when they felt they were becoming soft without a real challenge to their powers ultraman discovered earth one after gaining the power to gaze between worlds from exposure to a hunk of kryptonite wonder woman defeated superwoman on earth 1 and black canary defeated her on earth 2 and tied her up in her lasso like the other jsa members black canary is transported to earth 3 when superwoman accuses her of unfair advantage due to a

got them out they helped him again when the jla tried to restore history though were planning to betray him when degaton was defeated this timeline was erased and the syndicate was re imprisoned in the pre crisis dcu any amazon seen without her nonremovable indestructible bracelets was in fact driven mad superwoman was never seen with bracelets and this was part of her look to show she was in fact an evil aging amazon she also had a streak of grey hair on the original pre crisis earth three superwoman and lois lane are two separate people with lois working as a reporter for the daily star just like earth two and even having a short lived romance with captain comet when he came to her universe while chasing the secret society of super villains across multiple realities the pre crisis

crime syndicate comes from a parallel world similar to earth but located in an antimatter universe also home to the planet qward 8 superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the crime syndicate most recently appearing in storylines in the justice league and superman comics unlike her pre crisis counterpart her magic lasso doesn t change shape but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied to it just as wonder woman s compels victims to tell the truth bizarrely she also possesses heat vision as superman and ultraman do although there is no explanation for this taking the alias lois lane superwoman is an amazon by birth and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the daily planet in what she calls patriarch s world this disguise resembles wonder woman s secret identity of diana prince at the planet superwoman is shown to upset her colleagues the antimatter cat grant refers to superwoman as queen bitch 11 and negatively alludes to her friendship with the antimatter jimmy olsen in her later appearances it is stated that prior to taking on lois lane s identity superwoman was born on damnation island presumably the antimatter counterpart to themyscira or paradise island it is mentioned that she had murdered all of her fellow amazons and upon meeting donna troy she becomes ecstatic over the prospect of being able to murder another one of her kind for the first time in years 12 the antimatter universe s version of superwoman is the first version of the character to combine diana of themyscira and lois lane jimmy olsen is the only civilian who knows of superwoman s secret identity a compliant sexual deviant he does what she tells him in exchange for the favor of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces of it for his disguise kit he is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults even when she tauntingly refers to him as superwoman s snitch jimmy olsen and prints it in the planet also in the earth 2 story her lover ultraman hates superwoman s frigidity towards him meanwhile she is carrying on a torrid affair with owlman and they sneak trysts whenever they feel ultraman is not watching however from his floating fortress the antimatter counterpart to the fortress of solitude ultraman doesn t hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together 8 52

society of america including wonder woman the character is not identified in 52 13 but later in countdown to final crisis which identifies her as superwoman of the crime society of america on an alternative world which is a reversed version of earth 2 based on comments by grant morrison this alternate universe is not the pre crisis earth three making this a new character unrelated to previous versions 14 grant morrison also suggests that the earth 3 and antimatter superwomen both exist post 52 like the antimatter iteration of the character she is indeed both a lois lane and wonder woman counterpart despite possessing kryptonian abilities such as heat vision in countdown she is recruited into the monarch s army but has her eyes gouged out by red robin jason todd of new earth who may or may not have been carrying kryptonite the new 52 incarnation edit superwoman lois lane the new 52 earth 3 following dc s 2011 reboot event the new 52 characters from earth 3 are again revised

crazed alexander luthor of earth 3 who uses the power of the lightning and goes by the name mazahs she betrays ultraman revealing she and luthor are carrying a child who is prophesied to bring an end to the world after mazahs is killed by the luthor of the main universe superwoman is placed in captivity immune to wonder woman s lasso of truth wonder woman attempts traditional interrogation of her counterpart about the entity that destroyed their world but superwoman does not reveal any information just then she ends up announcing the baby it kicked 18 during the darkseid war storyline superwoman is freed from a r g u s custody by the justice league in order to help the justice league deal with the anti monitor 19 during the battle with the new gods superwoman starts to give birth right after she gave birth to her son on order from owlman superwoman used her child to absorb the omega sanction from lex luthor while boasting of her child s strength superwoman was disintegrated by grail who took the baby the baby was subsequently used by grail as a host to resurrect her father darkseid who had been slain by the anti monitor 20 infinite frontier incarnation edit following the reboot of the multiverse after dark nights death metal a new earth 3 and superwoman are created unlike most incarnations this superwoman is an alternate version of donna troy she is the second daughter of queen hippolyta of themyscira also known as demon s island her older sister diana was apparently killed by their mother for weakness donna was trained from birth to be merciless in combat and anticipate any strategy her enemy may use in 1945 a man named steve trevor came to devil s island seeking amazons to act as soldiers in a war that his side was losing donna fell in love with him but refused to leave her home so steve took her hostage and demanded that hippolyta provide warriors for his cause or he would kill donna much to his shock hippolyta simply told donna to save herself which she did stabbing steve in the stomach hippolyta explained that this was donna s final lesson words and emotion could be potent weapons which she would need to master the amazons had anticipated the rise of metahumans in man s world and donna was sent out to infiltrate and gain control over them she plans to one day return home at the head of an army of metahumans kill her mother and take the throne 21 donna became the ambassador to the united states of america from themyscira and she exerts considerable influence over the american government by sexually dominating president oliver queen

batwoman a female batman rather than the actual character wonder warrior a male wonder woman dc comics could not use the name wonder man at the time because marvel comics holds the trademark black condor a male black canary superlad a male supergirl and superwoman his female counterpart herself believing he crossed into a parallel universe superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal but is blocked by an invisible barrier he notices the parallelism fails when he sees superwoman and clara kent superwoman s presumed secret identity are two separate people when he confronts superwoman he discovers that he is regarded as a super villain in this gender reversed world which leads to a battle with superwoman superlad and wonder warrior they manage to trap superman with wonder warrior on guard but he manages to escape and takes wonder warrior s magic lasso with him superman figures out that his foe mr mxyzptlk is behind this gender reversed world this was partly due to the discrepancy of clara kent and superwoman being different people however mxyzptlk s biggest mistake was being too vain to give himself a reverse gender counterpart in superwoman s rogues gallery in the daily planet morgue all of superwoman s foes were reverse gender counterparts to superman s foes leslie luthor lex luthor bizaress bizarro and the toywoman toyman except for mxyzptlk superman discovers as well that he was never in a parallel universe but rather on earth which mxyzptlk had altered with his magic after using wonder warrior s magic lasso to make mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning him to his native dimension the effects of mxyzptlk s magic including the existence of superwoman vanish returning the earth to normal upon his return to his clark kent identity he is startled to discover there is still a louis lane but he turns out to be lois lane s cousin later stories including countdown and the multiversity would revisit the concept of a gender

costumes to their new earth counterparts indicating their world had also been affected by the flashpoint storyline though the exact nature of those changes is unrevealed the aquawoman of earth 11 would become a member of justice league incarnate a team which formed as a result of the multiversity event she would go on to help superwoman of earth 11 as well as a number of other superman counterparts to escape from a being called prophecy who was attempting to drain their powers in order to fight an unknown future threat together with aquawoman superman the new super man of china and the justice league incarnate prophecy was defeated and superwoman and the other superman counterparts would return to their worlds and times kristin wells edit another version of superwoman this one a heroic character came about in the form of kristin wells who was created by superman comic writer elliot s maggin wells first appeared in maggin s superman novel miracle monday but he later introduced her in the pages of dc comics presents as superwoman the character wells is a 29th century descendant of jimmy olsen wells time travels to the 20th century where the technology she had brought from the future gives her superpowers it is this iteration of the character which appears briefly in superman whatever happened to the man of tomorrow which creates a continuity problem in that she had already revealed jimmy olsen s final fate to become a great editor like perry white dana dearden edit obsessed superman fan dana dearden dated jimmy olsen to get close to superman and when that didn t work she stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of hercules the speed and flight of hermes the thunderbolts of zeus and the sight of heimdall dana donned a green and purple uniform with superwoman written down the leggings and called herself superwoman and tried to get superman to fall in love with her he rejected her advances and jimmy called her obsession she vanished attempting to help superman rescue people from a burning ship 24 the dana dearden superwoman when superman was split into his red and blue energy forms superwoman returned hoping that one of the supermen would return her feelings but maxima intervened and used her telepathy to convince superwoman that she would destroy superman with her love 25 the telepathic illusion wore off and she would try to win superman over again this time in a red and blue costume very similar to his and claimed to be his wife in response to a recent photograph of superman wearing a wedding ring during a subsequent attack of humans using the dmn drug which turned the users into violent demons until the high was over superman convinced her to help him stop the dmn users arguing that if she truly loved him she would help him do his duty rather than attack him for potentially picking someone else over her she died trying to protect him from one of the dmn users when it almost struck him in the back while he was distracted since she knew he was vulnerable to magic 26 lucy lane edit lucy lane first appeared as superwoman in supergirl vol 5 35 january 2009 her costume a nod to that of the bronze age superwoman kristin wells and containing a containment field that simulated kryptonian powers however lucy s identity was not revealed until near the story arc s end during her tenure as superwoman she was blackmailed by her father general sam lane into performing acts of villainy such as murdering agent liberty who had been spying on general lane and lex luthor 27 this resulted in her being the focus of the supergirl faces of evil issue lucy lane new krypton superwoman lucy lane later attacks reactron which tipped off readers that superwoman was not kryptonian since the villain s gold kryptonite power source had no effect on her 28 supergirl unmasks superwoman 29 and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit causing lucy s body to contort and explode 30 in the supergirl annual lucy is brought back to life by the suit as it steals the life of another person the suit is then revealed to be a magical creation of mirabai of the forlorn ally of sam lane who mystically infused in it the genetic abilities of several alien races of kryptonian might when supergirl ruptured it the backlash permanently altered lucy lane into being a composite alien being of human appearance herself with inherent kryptonian abilities 31 this superwoman was last seen as a prisoner after sam lane s machinations during the war of the supermen storyline came to an end though it was hinted she would escape at some point in the future the launch of the new 52 however ended that storyline lana lang edit superwoman 10 july 2017 art by ken lashley when superman died lana lang and lois lane both absorbed energy released from his body and the two women developed superhuman powers lana gained the power to convert solar radiation into various forms of electromagnetic energy while lois developed powers similar to superman s both lana and lois became superwoman after lois death lana became the sole superwoman during superman reborn it was revealed that the powers lois and lana received were the leftover energy from the new 52 superman the post crisis superman took that energy into himself to become an amalgam leaving lana seemingly powerless and confused some energy remained within her suit which was later found to be red kryptonite radiation other uses edit various comic stories pre and post crisis offer glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of supergirl would eventually change her codename to superwoman upon reaching adulthood one example is the superman family 200 april 1980 in which all the stories are set in the then near future 1999 or 2000 the timeframe is cited only as the turn of the century with the characters aged appropriately including an older linda danvers kara zor el who divides her time between

otto binder casting the character as a frankenstein s monster pastiche that possessed all the powers of superboy 3 shunned for his unenviable appearance the teen version of bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story an adult version appeared around the same time in the superman daily newspaper comic strip written by alvin schwartz debuting in episode 105 the battle with bizarro strips 6147 6242 august 25 1958 to december 13 1958 according to comics historian mark evanier schwartz long claimed that he originated the bizarro concept prior to the character s appearance in superboy 4 the newspaper storyline introduced the strange speech patterns that became synonymous with the character with all of bizarro s comments meaning the opposite e g bad means good the newspaper version wore a b on his chest as opposed to superman s distinctive s 5 schwartz stated 6 i was striving you might say for that mirror image that opposite and out of a machine which would reveal the negative superman came the mirror image always remembering that in a mirror everything is reversed the times were such that one dimensional characters your standard superheroes even in comics seemed rather simplistic like paper cut outs what was demanded was the full dimensional personality a figure that carried a shadow if you like i was certainly inspired to some degree also by c g jung s archetype of the shadow and bizarro certainly reflected that as well binder introduced the adult version of the character into the superman comic book this time wearing an s in action comics 254 july 1959 7 bizarro proved popular and eventually starred in a bizarro world feature in adventure comics for fifteen issues running from issue 285 299 june 1961 august 1962 8 as well as in a special all bizarro 80 page giant superman 202 december 1967 january 1968 the character made forty appearances 9 in the superman family of titles action comics superman superman s pal jimmy olsen superman s girl friend lois lane adventure comics secret society of super villains and dc comics presents from 1959 to 1984 prior to a reboot of the dc universe as a result of the limited series crisis on infinite earths 1 12 april 1985 march 1986 bizarro was reintroduced into the dc universe in a one off appearance with characterization similar to his original superboy appearance in superman the man of steel 5 december 1986 he was later revived in the bizarro s world serial that ran through the superman titles in march and april 1994 and in action comics annual 8 in 1996 an unrelated four issue limited series titled a bizarro july october was published in 1999 yet another version was introduced during the emperor joker storyline in september october 2000 remaining in dc comics continuity this bizarro continued to make semi regular guest appearances that firmly established the character as part of the superman mythos fictional character biography edit pre crisis bizarro edit general zod s bizarro army edit general dru zod had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet krypton the bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation this was the reason why zod was banished to the phantom zone for 25 krypton sun cycles 10 bizarro superboy edit some 12 years later totally oblivious to these facts a scientist on earth is demonstrating his newly invented duplicating ray to superboy and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero the copy quickly labeled bizarro is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior shunned by the people of smallville bizarro befriends a blind girl named melissa and loses all hope when he realizes that the girl did not shun or flee from him because she was blind superboy is eventually forced to kill the less than perfect clone using the remains of the duplicating machine which acts like blue kryptonite as opposed to green kryptonite superboy s weakness on the copy the whole business proved unexpectedly easy as bizarro deliberately destroyed himself by colliding with the duplicating machine s fragment the ensuing explosion miraculously restores melissa s eyesight 11 bizarro 1 edit years afterward superman s arch foe lex luthor recreates the duplicating ray and uses it on the hero hoping to control the duplicate that became known as bizarro 1 the bizarro that is created however is confused stating me not human me not creature me not even animal me unhappy me don t belong in world of living people me don t know difference between right and wrong good and evil 6 luthor is arrested by bizarro for re creating him but forgotten as bizarro attempts to emulate superman creating havoc in the city of metropolis and almost exposing superman s secret identity as clark kent when bizarro falls in love with reporter lois lane she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a bizarro lois who is instantly attracted to bizarro in addition he also used the duplicating ray on himself to create new bizarro who later dies from exposure to green kryptonite the bizarros leave earth together determined to find a home where they can be themselves 12 superman encounters the couple once again discovering that bizarro now called bizarro 1 has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of bizarros who now reside on a cube shaped planet called htrae earth spelled backwards 13 bizarro 1 and bizarro lois 1 also give birth to a child who while super powered appears to be totally human considered a freak by bizarro standards out of resentment for the way he was treated by earth humans bizarro 1 made a law that they must act the opposite of humans causing no end of lunacy the child is the catalyst for a brief war between htrae and earth 14 blue kryptonite is also invented during this war as well as the temporary existence of bizarro supergirl bizarro also has a series of adventures on htrae aiding a normal jimmy olsen when he is accidentally trapped there 15 preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues 16 and stopping the bizarro version of titano 17 bizarro s influence is also felt on earth jimmy olsen is inadvertently turned into a bizarro for a while 18 and a new teen version of bizarro travels to the 30th century and attempts to join the legion of super heroes when he is rejected by the legion the bizarro teen creates his own bizarro version of the legion which superboy eventually persuades him to disband 19 when bizarro encounters superman once again his powers are now the opposite of superman s such as freeze vision as opposed to heat vision and heat breath rather than freeze breath and he attempts to kidnap lois lane 20 bizarro also temporarily joins the secret society of super villains to battle the justice league of america and captain comet 21 22 bizarro appears in the alan moore scripted whatever happened to the man of tomorrow in superman 423 september 1986 bizarro goes berserk and destroys the bizarro world and its inhabitants then travels to metropolis and wreaks havoc before abruptly committing suicide this and many other deaths turn out to be the machinations of mister mxyzptlk who had begun a rampage of crime superman is unable to undo the deaths but kills mxyzptlk and then uses gold kryptonite on himself bizarro s final pre crisis appearance was in dc comics presents 97 september 1986 which was also the final issue of that series after being empowered by a hideously disfigured phantom zone sorcerer mr mxyzptlk destroys zrfff and then causes the bizarro world to implode killing all its inhabitants bizarro s severed head crashes onto clark kent s desk and addresses clark kent before his simulated life ends bizarro does not appear in the crisis on infinite earths apparently because of this story s events this story directly contradicts a world s finest story where it is revealed that sometime in the future htrae is transformed into a more normal world egg shaped rather than cubical by the radiation from an exploding celestial body the bizarros are changed into normal people without powers but still retain vestiges of their bizarro laws curtains hung outside the windows of a house etc 23 post crisis edit project changeling edit after the events of crisis on infinite earths lex luthor orders his scientific team to create a clone of superman that was part of project changeling incorrectly starting from the assumption that superman is a human with metahuman abilities his alien origin had not yet been revealed the process results in a flawed copy which luthor dismissively refers to as this bizarre oh forget it before ordering for the subject to be

minimal contact and even melt steel at maximum intensity vacuum breath instead of wind breath he can inhale large amounts of air to draw people and objects towards him bizarro telescopic vision which allows bizarro to see a short distance behind his head rather than a long distance in front of his head bizarro microscopic vision which makes objects actually smaller to everyone rather than merely appear to be bigger to only the user bizarro x ray vision which allows bizarro to only see through lead rather than the ability to see through anything except lead spotlight vision which allows bizarro to project beams of light in the fashion of a spotlight from his eyes to highlight what he is looking at x ray hearing which allows bizarro to hear through everything except lead when

isolation and loneliness he attempted to combat through artwork when superman was stranded in the underverse zibarro helped him marshal the other bizarros into building a rocketship that could send kal el home zibarro briefly considered taking superman s place in the rocket but realized he had no way of knowing he would find any more acceptance among humans than his kinsmen before leaving

giordano further reading matches malone at the comic book db archived from the original matches malone at the grand comics database matches malone was originally a gotham gang boss who batman attempted to recruit to help take down ra s al ghul he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for batman who began to impersonate the man to use his underworld contacts and to fool ra s 24 post crisis he was a relatively small time arsonist with his brother carver and who came to gotham city early on in batman s career attracting batman s attention when carver was apparently murdered although matches was the prime suspect there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and matches was released only for batman to subsequently find what appeared to be matches s dead body in another fire apparently a suicide batman never reported his death at the time he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help gather information but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of prompting batman to adopt the man s identity as his own years later batman learned the truth about what had happened carver s death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched with matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother s suicide subsequently deciding to escape batman stalking him for the crime matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death with batman being so eager to establish a criminal alias and never taking the time to definitively confirm the body s identity after operating underground for years by committing low end robberies matches returned to gotham after hearing reports of his activities only to be shot by scarface for his recent betrayal surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to batman and nightwing before dying with his last request being that batman bury him next to his brother having destroyed scarface in revenge for matches s death batman commented to nightwing later on that the former continued using the identity because of having come to recognize that matches was not an evil man but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for regarding his use of his name as a chance to give matches some absolution the matches malone identity indirectly caused the events of batman war games stephanie brown after being fired as robin attempted to implement an old plan of batman s that would allow the latter to take control of the city s criminal organizations hoping that this would impress batman enough to convince to take stephanie back stephanie was unaware that the agent who was meant to take control of the meeting was actually batman himself resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand off leading into the subsequent gang wars and stephanie s own apparent death in the batman adventures comic book series batman uses the matches malone guise against the false face society and a backstory reveals malone was a low level enforcer for rupert thorne who agreed to become a snitch for batman and commissioner gordon against thorne but when malone began skimming cash from thorne he was shot to death by two chicago triggers who go by the monikers dapper for always dressing well and cricket for a short wiry build upon finding the dying malone and being told that his killers went to a well known chinese restaurant batman removed his glasses and was shocked by what malone looked like batman took the man s guise defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison and has used the guise ever since in the batman beyond rebirth series terry mcginnis uses the alias of trey malone son of matches malone to infiltrate terminal s jokerz but terminal saw through terry s disguise due to recognizing him from high school matches malone in other media edit the character is named jimmy malone in the aborted tom mankiewicz

superman 1 traditional depictions of zor el in golden age and silver age dc comics stories portrayed him as a benevolent scientist concerned for his daughter kara acting similarly to his brother jor el in sending his child to safety on earth in the mid 2000s dc experimented with different characterisations of zor el even briefly casting him as a mad scientist with a grudge against his brother a

believe his brother jor el s predictions about the impending destruction of krypton when the planet exploded argo city was somehow blown safely into space with a life giving bubble of air around it a later version of the story in action comics 316 september 1964 has the city saved by weather dome that zor el had constructed the explosion had turned the ground beneath argo city into kryptonite but zor el and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead the kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years and kara was born a short time after the destruction of krypton the end for argo city came when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation zor el managed to build a rocket and use it to send his daughter kara to earth fearing that superman would not recognize her because he had left krypton as an infant kara s parents provided a costume based closely on the man of steel s own it was later revealed to supergirl through zor el induced dreams that her parents had teleported away into the survival zone similar to the phantom zone during argo s final moments supergirl was able to rescue them in action comics 310 march 1964 and zor el and alura went on to live in kandor when the bottle city was enlarged zor el and alura resettled on new krypton rokyn earth two edit in the alternate universe of earth

spacecraft as she aged inside the rocket on her way to earth two taking a different longer course than kal l did she experienced the type of life she would have had on krypton zor l and allura were

timelines edit zor el birthright timeline version as he appears in supergirl vol 5 5 march 2006 dc comics art by ian churchill in the supergirl from krypton story arc in superman batman 8 13 may october 2004 zor el rocketed his daughter away from krypton before kal el left it was expected that she would reach earth first and could help raise kal from his infancy however she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach earth until years later so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens after lex luthor uses black kryptonite to split kara into good and evil parts the evil kara claims that zor el actually sent his daughter to earth to kill his nephew since he was resentful of his older brother and hated the idea of jor el s lineage continuing past krypton s destruction regardless of the truth or falseness of this kara has rejected this aspect of herself in the new supergirl series new information on zor el s history and relations are crucial with zor el was featured in issue 16 as he appeared as an apparition and explained what truly happened to kara and why she was sent to earth to kill kal el in a dream sequence zor el was against the use of the phantom zone as a prison because he felt that it would become abused since no blood was shed it became a clean way to deal with criminals in the argo city area he lived in he was a very trusted scientist like his brother jor el and was working at this time on sunstones krypton s crystalline technology he fought with jor el over the use of the phantom zone and tried to stop him from supporting it zor el began to see that each time someone went in something was also coming out in the form of phantoms these phantoms possessed people creating anarchy on krypton zor el discovered he could stop them using his sunstones although the bodies of the possessed would be destroyed however zor el was not believed and began to be seen as a dangerous crank this tied together and explained fragmented flashbacks that had suggested zor el was a villainous character including his dismissal of schoolchildren taunting kara as the dead they had already been possessed and alura telling kara to kill her and make your father proud she had also been possessed and this was not a taunt but a genuine request from what remained of her original personality as well as the original idea that he wanted kara to kill kal el as the story ended it was revealed that the house of el was cursed by the phantoms as they saw them as their jailers wherever one of the el blood line went the phantoms would follow to save earth he needed to send kara to remove kal and stop the el blood line from ever growing at the end of this story arc however it was revealed that the images of zor el and the phantoms subsequently invading earth as predicted were all a ruse by the monitors to see if supergirl belonged in the new earth universe upon discovering she was truly that universe s supergirl she was left to her own devices to reconcile with all the people she harmed in the wake of the test the monitor does however assert that the memories of zor el and the phantoms on krypton were nevertheless real new krypton edit a subsequent flashback in 24 apparently contradicts the monitor revealing that new earth zor el was not a scientist although alura was in current continuity zor el was a ranger and got on well with his brother with his encouragement alura designed the ship that sent kara to earth as both kal el s protector and the last living being who remembered krypton since kal el was an infant nothing further has been revealed about the real new earth zor el as yet in action comics 869 it is revealed the zor el saved argo city from krypton s destruction by engineering a protective dome with his wife alura however brainiac who was the culprit for krypton s explosion returned to finish the job he merged argo with the bottle city of kandor and killed those he considered to be duplicate information superman finds the city in brainiac s ship zor el and alura are able to make contact with kal el to enquire about their daughter he was later murdered by reactron 3 in supergirl vol 5 43 zor el is described as a noted member of krypton s artist guild and kara as sharing his creative impulse in blackest night crossover while kara and alura are visiting zor el s tomb discussing the situation with earth zor el is reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps ready to attack his wife and daughter the scientists of new krypton manage to place a forcefield composed of a counter energy to the black ring s power source around the planet cutting off zor el s right hand and preventing him from continuing his attack 4 the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline supergirl discovers an amnesiac cyborg superman living on the planet i noxia this turns out to be zor el who was rescued from krypton s destruction by brainiac and reconfigured as a half man half machine to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe 5 his backstory is that in spite of his jealousy and resentment zor el listened when jor el claimed krypton was doomed using brainiac based technology he built a dome around argo city and a space rocket to send kara to earth just in case argo s force field failed he did not warn his wife and daughter about his plans though minutes before the explosion he put his daughter to sleep laid her on a space pod and blasted her into space an action for which his wife nonfatally shot him before realizing that he was correct about the fate of krypton argo city outlived krypton but not for long without a way to sustain themselves the cities seven million inhabitants died off zor el sent a distress signal but less than a dozen people remained alive when brainiac found the city brainiac turned zor el into a cyborg erased his memory and reprogrammed him to serve him still zor el was not a compliant servant he was obsessed with achieving perfection and getting his lost memories back the new zor el met and fought supergirl who gave him the cyborg superman moniker several times 6 7 zor el eventually rebelled against brainiac he was soundly defeated and left for dead still his systems rebooted restoring his memory in the process zor el was appalled at what he had become and what he had done and became obsessed with bringing argo city back and recreating krypton convincing himself it was for his daughter s sake 8 unfortunately his chosen method demanded the sacrifice of earth people s lives forcing supergirl to stop him after defeating him kara told her father he could have looked for another way to save argo and she would have helped him but he never wanted that still she was not willing to give up on her father so zor el was taken to dr veritas s lab and was placed inside a pod as dr veritas went about removing his cybernetic components and reconstructing his body using tychotech s technology his daughter still visited him unwilling to give up on her father but zor el pretended to sleep and never talked back it was not until indigo nearly killed supergirl that he acted by tearing indigo into pieces although he was only saving his daughter s life the national city s townsfolk felt his actions confirmed supergirl was protecting a murderer only because he was her father zor el was captured by the d e o taken to a clandestine base and locked up there he was visited by mister oz who gave him what he considered a mercy kill by activating the red plasma failsafe in his containment tank leaving him to drown in it powerless 9 in other media edit television edit zor el appears alongside his wife alura

chassis was first made at royce s manchester works with production moving to derby in july 1908 and also between 1921 and 1926 in springfield massachusetts chassis no 60551 registered ax 201 was the car that was originally given the name silver ghost other 40 50 hp cars were also given names but the silver ghost title was taken up by the press and soon all 40 50s were called by the name a fact not officially recognised by rolls royce until 1925 when the phantom range was launched the silver ghost was the origin of rolls royce s claim of making the best car in the world a phrase coined not by themselves but by the prestigious publication autocar in 1907 citation needed the chassis and engine were also used as the basis of a range of rolls royce armoured cars contents 1 history 2 the

be shown at the olympia car show two existing models a four cylinder 20 hp and a six cylinder 30 hp and two examples of a new car designated the 40 50 hp the 40 50 hp was so new that the show cars were not fully finished and examples were not provided to the press for testing until march 1907 3 the car at first had a new side valve six cylinder 7036 cc engine 7428 cc from 1910 with the cylinders cast in two units of three cylinders each as opposed to the triple two cylinder units on the earlier six a three speed transmission was fitted at first with four speed units used from 1913 the seven bearing crankshaft had full pressure lubrication and the centre main bearing was made especially large to remove vibration essentially splitting the engine into two three cylinder units two spark plugs were fitted to each cylinder with from 1921 a choice of magneto or coil ignition 4 the earliest cars had used a trembler coil to produce the spark with a magneto as an optional extra which soon became standard the instruction was to start the engine on the trembler battery and then switch to magneto continuous development allowed power output to be increased from 48 bhp 36 kw at 1 250 rpm to 80 bhp 60 kw at 2 250 rpm electric lighting became an option in 1914 and was standardised in 1919 1 electric starting was fitted from 1919 4 along with electric lights to replace the older ones that used acetylene or oil development of the silver ghost was suspended during world war i although the chassis and engine were supplied for use in rolls royce armoured cars 5 a blue 1909 silver ghost known as blue mist previously owned by an irish lord was used by lawrence of arabia as his personal staff car during the arab revolt 6 7 construction of a replica blue mist began in 2018 8 the chassis had rigid front and rear axles and leaf springs all round early cars only had brakes on the rear wheels operated by a hand lever with a pedal operated transmission brake acting on the propellor shaft the footbrake system moved to drums on the rear axle in 1913 four wheel servo assisted brakes became optional in 1923 4 despite these improvements the performance of the silver ghost s competitors had improved to the extent that its previous superiority had been eroded by the early 1920s sales declined from 742 in 1913 to 430 in 1922 the company decided to launch its replacement which was introduced in 1925 as the new phantom 9 after this older 40 50 models were called silver ghosts to avoid confusion a total of 7874 silver ghost cars were produced from 1907 to 1926 including 1701 from the american springfield factory the documented chassis price listed for the 1921 american version was us 11 750 178 508 in 2021 dollars 10 4 2 many of them still run today a fine example is on display at the national motor museum beaulieu the alpine eagles edit a 40 50 was privately entered in the prestigious 1912 austrian alpine trial by james radley but its 3 speed gearbox proved inadequate for the ascent of the katschberg pass a factory team of four cars were prepared for the 1913 event with four speed gearboxes and engine power increased from 60 bhp 45 kw to 75 bhp 56 kw by an increase in compression ratio and larger carburettor the team gained six awards including the archduke leopold cup replicas of the victorious cars were put into production and sold officially as continental models but they were called alpine eagles by chief test driver and later rolls royce managing director ernest hives and this is the name that they have kept citation needed the silver ghost edit in 1907 claude johnson commercial and managing director of rolls royce ordered a car to be used as a demonstrator by the company with chassis no 60551 and registered ax 201 it was the 12th 40 50 hp to be made 3 and was painted in aluminium paint with silver plated fittings the car was named the silver ghost to emphasise its ghost like quietness and a plaque bearing this name adorned the bulkhead an open top roi des belges body by coachbuilder barker was fitted and the car readied for the scottish reliability trials of 1907 and immediately afterwards another 15 000 mile 24 000 km test which included driving between london and glasgow 27 times the aim was to raise public awareness of the new company and to show the reliability and quietness of their new car this was a risky idea cars of this time were notoriously unreliable and roads of the day could be horrendous nevertheless the car set off on trials and with press aboard broke various records even after 7 000 miles 11 000 km the cost to service the car was a negligible 2 2s 7d 2 13 3 the reputation of the 40 50 and rolls royce was established ax201 was sold in 1908 to a private customer who used it for his annual annual clarification needed to italy and recovered by the company in 1948 since then it has been used as a publicity car and travelled worldwide in 1991 the car was restored in 2005 it was noted to be

noa he appeared in the second episode clark kent reporter which aired on february 14 1940 he transitioned into the comic books later that year appearing in superman 7 november 1940 in the adventures of superman television series episode crime wave and the post crisis comic continuity he was an award winning journalist who served a term as mayor of metropolis he worked as an assistant editor in the daily star under george taylor before becoming editor in chief of the daily planet 3 his most well known catchphrases are great caesar s ghost and don t call me chief fictional character biography edit golden and silver age edit the earliest superman comics shows clark kent and lois lane working for the newspaper the daily star and an editor named george taylor however this was soon changed with perry white first appearing as the editor of a newly renamed the daily planet 4 in the adventures of superman it was established white had a law degree but had never practiced law journalism having a greater attraction for him 5 in the 1960s and 1970s dc comics after the multiverse method of continuity tracking was implemented the above inconsistency was explained away by declaring that on earth one the silver age universe perry white is clark and lois employer at the daily planet while on earth two the golden age universe george taylor is that world s editor in chief of the daily star the perry white of earth two is a lead reporter for the daily star and according to a superman family tale has filled in as editor from time to time while taylor was away prior to the changes detailed in crisis on infinite earths perry begins his career as a freelance reporter for various newspapers including a chicago newspaper 6 and gotham city s gotham gazette 7 he eventually goes to work at the daily planet as a reporter and earns his first pulitzer prize by being the first to write about superboy s extraterrestrial origins thanks to an exclusive interview with the boy of steel 8 later still perry s reporting skills earn more praise after being the first to discover that superboy has moved to metropolis from smallville superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time so as not to alert anyone to superboy and clark kent leaving smallville around the same time 9 finally during clark kent s junior year of college perry is promoted to editor in chief of the newspaper after the retirement of the paper s previous editor the earth one version of george taylor 10 in the early 1970s the daily planet is bought by morgan edge president of the media conglomerate galaxy communications with much of perry s power in running the paper overtaken by edge 11 in the months just prior to the crisis reboot in 1985 it is implied that perry white is beginning to succumb to alzheimer s disease manifesting in increased forgetfulness and confusion volume issue needed modern age edit with writer john byrne s post crisis on infinite earths revamp of superman s origin in the man of steel miniseries and his subsequent superman comics perry s history was fleshed out more fully post crisis perry is born in metropolis suicide slum area growing up with a father missing after heading off to war overseas he becomes a copy boy at the daily planet beginning a lifetime career that will take him up the newspaper s career ladder perry goes to school with lex luthor while they are children luthor was also born in suicide slum after luthor becomes a successful businessman he begins diversifying his holdings in his newly founded lexcorp company which includes buying the daily planet luthor soon sells it after deciding to pursue technology and television investments turning down an offer from luthor to become part of luthor s new television station wlex perry finds an investor who saves the daily planet on the condition that perry is promoted from reporter to managing editor the entire episode not the least of which is what perry felt as having been forced out of his active writing career leaves perry bitter and angry with luthor perry marries alice spencer and has a son jerry white much later after jerry is fully grown perry learns that lex luthor is jerry s biological father luthor briefly seduces alice while perry is overseas reporting on a war and thought to be killed perry white s two greatest moves as the editor are hiring of lois lane and later clark kent when she was 15 lois had impressed perry with her persistence in trying to get employment at the newspaper by lying about her age after jerry white dies from a gunshot perry and alice grieve for some time resulting in perry taking a leave of absence from the daily planet later perry and alice adopt an orphaned african american boy named keith robert parks who soon has his name changed to keith robert white at about this time perry takes another leave of absence for lung cancer treatment putting clark kent in charge as the planet s temporary editor after many grueling months of chemotherapy the cancer goes into remission one of perry s proudest moments is attending the wedding of lois and clark he sits in the front row beside lois parents lois considers him as close a relative as her own family 12 as the paper continues to struggle the planet s owner franklin stern sells the paper to lex luthor luthor acting out of pure malice dismantles the paper he fires everyone except lois lane jimmy olsen and two others who are relocated to lexcom lex new internet based news company shortly thereafter lex sells the planet to bruce wayne for 1 thanks to a secret deal with lois lane white is hired back as editor in chief and the entire former staff is hired back as well though perry s knowledge of clark s alter ego is uncertain it is known that he has found a dusty suit of his star reporter s clothes in a supply closet including his passport for this reason perry may well suspect that clark and superman are the same person but due to his personal admiration for both clark and superman he has never confided this suspicion or knowledge to anybody bruce wayne believes that because of white s superior skill as a reporter he knows that clark is superman perry white is too good a reporter not to have uncovered clark s secret and yet he acts otherwise reminding me how good a detective jim gordon is back in gotham city batman hush perry s editorship keeps the daily planet as one of the few newspapers that dare to heavily criticize luthor even after luthor s successful election as president of the united states because of the changes in superman s history in recent years including 2003 2004 s miniseries birthright much is not certain about perry s history in final crisis 2 lois and perry are caught in an apparently fatal explosion triggered by clayface at the daily planet as of final crisis 3 it was revealed that perry is alive but on life support perry has since then recovered however and is now back to running the paper when the world begins to grow increasingly more paranoid towards the new population of kryptonians lois begins to investigate the conspiracies executed by the us government and her father general lane in particular however the government becomes aware of lois actions and attempt to shut her down as a result perry is unable to print any of lois stories because of general lane s power unwilling to let this slide perry suggests that lois quit the paper so as to continue her investigation 13 in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock perry white has changed the name of the article revolving around the superman theory much to the dismay of lois lane at the time when she and clark kent think that someone is pulling the strings behind this theory 14 other versions edit in the limited comic series dc universe online legends perry white was captured alongside lois lane and jimmy olsen in the daily planet by brainiac but was saved by superman with lex luthor in possession of the canister containing them 15 16 later perry became one of the people who has gained metahuman abilities from braniac s exobytes transforming his body into a being of ice and granting him ice powers which has surprised him 17 later he adopted the code name frost 18 in the limited series all star superman perry remains the boss of the daily planet and publishes an article that incriminates lex luthor resulting in his arrest and sentenced execution in the limited series superman red son perry is the editor in chief of the daily planet eventually succeeded by lois luthor in the tie in comic to young justice perry is at bibbo s diner where bibbo comments on the behavior of his other guests but perry doesn t respond five years later perry was at the front door of the daily planet when a spaceship launched a device

appears in the 1990s television series lois and clark the new adventures of superman played by lane smith perry was a baby boomer with an abiding fondness for rock and roll particularly elvis presley instead of great caesar s ghost he sometimes said great shades of elvis and the comics briefly followed suit in a subplot that carried over many episodes perry is portrayed as having marital difficulties with his wife alice due to his dedication to the paper the couple later reunites just before the series finale in the 2000s television series smallville perry white appears in the season 3 episode perry and is portrayed by michael mckean in this show he is a multiple pulitzer nominated reporter formerly working for the daily planet who gets reduced to tabloid television after attempting to expose lionel luthor s corrupt dealings he attempts to regain some of his old reputation by exposing clark s powers but the plan backfires when a random solar flare temporarily nullifies clark s abilities although clark s subsequent heroism despite his currently powerless status prompts perry to both abandon the idea that clark has powers and cause him to consider turning over a new leaf even offering to give clark a recommendation into journalism as a career in future the phrase don t call me chief was worked into this episode when white irritates sheriff nancy adams by calling her chief it s later implied in the season 4 episode gone that perry is working his way back up with an article on lionel s conviction he reprised his role in the season 9 episode hostage as the new

movie and its three sequels from the 1980s jackie cooper played perry as a tough character who never let his reporters forget he had worked for the planet nearly all his life the don t call me chief line was worked into a gag about ordering coffee and became don t call me sugar when he orders a coffee with sugar and jimmy olsen calls him chief and he tells him not to call him sugar cooper s perry was also fond of aphorisms such as a good reporter doesn t get great stories a good reporter makes them great in the commentary track for superman director richard donner reveals that cooper got the

african american to play perry white in a live action film in man of steel while his position does not deviate from the comics his view of superman is somewhat different rather than seeing the

kryptonite ring alexander joseph lex luthor ˈluːθɔːr θər is a supervillain appearing in american comic books published by dc comics the character was created by jerry siegel and joe shuster lex luthor originally appeared in action comics 23 cover dated april 1940 he has since endured as the archnemesis of the superhero superman 1 lex luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the early 1980s since the late 1980s he has more often been portrayed as the power mad ceo of lexcorp he wishes to rid the world of superman ostensibly because he views superman as a threat to humanity but in reality envies superman s popularity and influence 2 given his high profile as a supervillain however he has often come into conflict with batman and other superheroes in the dc universe 3 lex luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers but has above average intelligence a genius for inventions and a high command of science and technology he occasionally wears his warsuit a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength flight advanced weaponry and other capabilities while lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains in the likes of metallo parasite and bizarro and frequently leading dc supervillain teams such as the legion of doom he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with superman and other heroes when situation calls for it 4 the character was ranked 4th on ign s list of the top 100 comic book villains of all time 5 and as the 8th greatest villain by wizard on its 100 greatest villains of all time list 6 luthor is one of a few genre crossing villains whose adventures take place in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended 4 scott james wells sherman howard john shea michael rosenbaum and jon cryer have portrayed the character in television series while lyle talbot gene hackman kevin spacey and jesse eisenberg have portrayed the character in films several actors have provided luthor s voice in animated adaptations including clancy brown mark rolston james marsters and giancarlo esposito contents 1

appearance action comics 23 april 1940 luthor is depicted as a diabolical genius and is referred to only by his surname he resides in a flying city suspended by a dirigible and plots to provoke a war between two european nations lois lane and clark kent investigate which results in lois being kidnapped luthor battles superman with a green ray but he is ultimately defeated and lois is rescued superman destroys luthor s dirigible with him still on it implying luthor may have died stories ending with luthor s apparent death become common in his earliest appearances with him turning up alive later on 7 luthor as he appears in superman 4 1940 luthor returns in superman 4 and steals a weapon from the u s army capable of causing earthquakes superman battles and defeats luthor then destroys the earthquake device the scientist who made the device commits suicide to prevent its reinvention in a story in the same issue luthor creates a city on the sunken lost continent of pacifo and populates it with recreated prehistoric monsters he plans to unleash upon the world superman thwarts his plans and luthor is seemingly killed by the dinosaurs he created luthor returns in superman 5 with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people so he can throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier moseley the story ends with superman defeating him in these early stories luthor s schemes are centered around financial gain or megalomaniacal ambitions unlike most later incarnations he demonstrates no strong animosity toward superman beyond inevitable resentment of the hero s constant interference with his plans luthor s obsessive hatred of superman came later in the character s development in luthor s earliest appearances he is shown as a middle aged man with a full head of red hair less than a year later however an artistic mistake resulted in luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip 8 the original error is attributed to leo nowak a studio artist who illustrated for the superman dailies during this period 9 one hypothesis is that nowak mistook luthor for the ultra humanite a recurring mad scientist foe of superman who in his golden age incarnation resembled a balding elderly man 9 other evidence suggests luthor s design was confused with that of a stockier bald henchman in superman 4 spring 1940 9 luthor s next appearance occurs in superman 10 may 1941 in which nowak depicted him as significantly heavier with visible jowls 9 the character s abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times over the course of his history in 1960 writer jerry siegel altered luthor s backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin during world war ii the war department asked for dailies of the superman comic strip to be pulled the strips in question were created in april 1945 and depicted lex luthor bombarding superman with the radiation from a cyclotron this violated wartime voluntary censorship guidelines meant to help conceal the manhattan project 10 11 luthor vanished for a long time coming back in superboy 59 september 1957 in a story called superboy meets amazing man a flying costumed bald man probably in his forties appears in smallville and starts helping people using his fantastic inventions he later moves his operations to the nearby town of hadley superboy finds he is using his inventions to set the town up so he can rob their bank and stops him in the last panel amazing man is in jail and he tells superboy he will regret it as sure as his name is luthor and superboy thinks that he will be superman by the time luthor gets out and that luthor s talents might make him an archenemy silver age lex luthor edit in 1956 dc comics reimagined the flash with a new secret identity costume and origin this led to the new silver age of comics and the first dc comics reboot with characters across the board being reimagined or having their histories and nature redefined the earlier golden age stories of superman and batman were later said to have taken place on earth two a parallel universe that was part of the larger dc multiverse the silver age version of luthor was introduced in adventure comics 271 april 1960 now given the first name lex later said to be short for alexis eventually retconned as alexander and an origin story originally hero worshiping superboy teenage lex luthor of smallville is determined to prove he is earth s greatest scientist by creating artificial life his recklessness and inexperience causes a fire in his lab and he calls on superboy to save him the boy of steel puts out the fire but in the process accidentally destroys the artificial life form and the years of research notes that led to its creation while fumes from the chemical fire cause luthor s hair to fall out unwilling to hold himself responsible for the lab fire and the destruction of his own life s work luthor decides that superboy was jealous of his intellect and caused the fire himself believing he s been betrayed by his hero and friend lex swears revenge 12 this revised origin makes luthor s fight with superman a personal one and suggests that if events had unfolded differently luthor might have grown to be a more noble person luthor s ego preventing him from personal growth and the tragedy that he and clark could have been a force for good together are played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s particularly in elliot s maggin s novels last son of krypton and miracle monday 13 the golden age version of luthor appears again as a villain still alive and well on earth two to distinguish him from the modern day lex luthor the original incarnation is shown as having kept his red hair and is retroactively given the first name alexei in dc comics presents annual 1 1982 alexei luthor of earth two and lex luthor of earth one team up it is shown that alexei is arguably colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of earth in order to prove his superiority whereas lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die 14 years later lex luthor and the villain brainiac recruit an army of super villains during crisis on infinite earths including alexei luthor from earth two when alexei argues that this army doesn t need two luthors brainiac agrees and executes him post crisis reboot edit cover of the man of steel 4 1986 art by john byrne following crisis on infinite earths 1985 1986 dc rebooted its universe yet again creating the post crisis reality in the 1986 limited series the man of steel john byrne redesigned lex luthor from scratch intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize an evil corporate executive byrne intentionally chose to base this new depiction of luthor on businessmen donald trump ted turner howard hughes and satan himself 15 initially brutish and overweight the character later evolved into a sleeker more athletic version of his old self luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire rather his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time marv wolfman a writer on action comics who had one conversation with byrne prior to luthor s reboot 16 recalled i never believed the original luthor every story would begin with him breaking out of prison finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere and then he d be defeated my view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn t need to rob banks i also thought later that luthor should not have super powers every other villain had super powers luthor s power was his mind he needed to be smarter than superman superman s powers had to be useless against him because they couldn t physically fight each other and superman was simply not as smart as luthor 17 as originally presented in the post crisis version of the dc comics universe lex luthor is a product of child abuse and early poverty born in the suicide slum district of metropolis he is instilled with a desire to become a self made man of great power and influence as a teenager he takes out a large life insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge then sabotages their car s brakes causing their deaths upon graduating from mit luthor founds his own business lexcorp which grows to dominate much of metropolis luthor does not fully appear in the man of steel mini series until the fourth issue which takes place over a year after superman s arrival in metropolis terrorists seize luthor s yacht forcing superman to intervene 18 satisfied at the hero s performance luthor attempts to hire him admitting he knew about the incoming attack and allowed it to occur so he could see how superman responded assuming that the man of steel would arrive in time enraged the mayor deputizes superman to arrest luthor for reckless endangerment although luthor is released from jail quickly and has the charges dropped the humiliation of being publicly arrested and processed coupled with indignation that superman refused to work for him results in the villain pledging to destroy superman simply to prove his power despite general acceptance of byrne s characterization which led to its influence in media adaptations dc comics writers began bringing back his quality of being a scientific genius in the 1990s in stories such as the final night by 2000 it was said that luthor s genuine accomplishments in several scientific fields is what helped create lexcorp and make it so successful so quickly in early post crisis stories byrne suggested that luthor was recognised as a brilliant inventor and great scientific mind but had largely withdrawn from his laboratory in favour of the boardroom regarding the character being a corrupt billionaire rather than a mad scientist author neil gaiman commented it s a pity lex luthor has become a multinationalist i liked him better as a bald scientist he was in prison but they couldn t put his mind in prison now he s just a skinny kingpin 19 luthor s romantic aspirations toward lois lane established early on in the series become a focal point of the stories immediately following it 20 he is shown making repeated attempts to court her during the man of steel though lois plainly does not return his feelings 21 in the superman adventures comic line based on the tv series of the same name luthor s backstory is identical to that of the post crisis origin with slight changes luthor is shown originating in suicide slum his intelligence outshining other children fueling his ambition to have all metropolis look up to him one day luthor s baldness is never explained save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood it is assumed the hair loss was natural luthor s parents die during his teenage years however their deaths are indeed accidental lex uses the insurance to pay for his tuition to mit and then founds lexcorp his hatred of superman is explained as the citizens of metropolis have admired the man of steel more than him modern depictions edit superman birthright a limited series written by mark waid in 2004 offers an alternate look at luthor s history including his youth in smallville and his first encounter with superman the story has similarities to the 2001 television series smallville 22 which follows clark kent s life as a teenager and into early adulthood one plot element shared by the comic and the show is the problematic relationship between lex and his father lionel along with this birthright restores the silver age concept of luthor befriending clark kent as a young man the two find a kinship in both feeling like outsider and sharing a wish to explore outer space and discover alien alife despite one resenting humanity and the other hoping to understand and be accepted by it lex discovers kryptonite samples in smallville and uses them as a power source for a machine he hopes will pierce space and time so he can communicate with krypton when clark falls ill approaching the machine lex mistakes his reaction as doubt in the young scientist s ability and sanity feeling betrayed lex continues the experiment but an explosion erupts the radiation blast causing his hair to fall out 23 24 luthor leaves metropolis and years later his scientific work largely based on his ideas about alien life results in a fortune he uses to create lexcorp when superman appears lex is angry at the powerful alien the kind of companion he d often hoped for looks on him with disapproval and openly disrespects him in front of the media for this and his interference with luthor s criminal operations the scientist businessman decides to humiliate and destroy the alien waid s original intention was to jettison the notion of lex luthor being an evil businessman restoring his status as a mad scientist he ultimately conceded however that the ceo luthor would be easier for readers to recognize in birthright luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate in contrast to byrne s characterization however lexcorp is founded upon luthor s study of extraterrestrial life thereby providing a link between him and superman 22 25 in the retrospective section of the superman birthright trade paperback waid explains despite my own personal prejudices i say we leave lex the criminal businessman he s been for the past 17 years the lois clark producers liked it the wb cartoon guys liked it so clearly it works on some level my concern is that at least in my eyes the fact that luthor s allowed to operate uncontested for years makes superman look ineffectual 26 birthright was initially intended to establish a new origin for superman and luthor 27 immediately the superman comics and the series superman batman made references to the canonicity of the new origin series but after infinite crisis ended in 2006 new stories discredited parts of it and it was officially replaced by the 2009 2010 series superman secret origin 28 superman secret origin revised lex s backstory so that he now again had a sister lena while he knew clark as a teenager in smallville he rejected the other boy s attempts to form a friendship resentful toward his alcoholic and abusive father lex arranges his parents to die in a car accident and uses the insurance money to leave smallville and start a better life after studying under the villains ra s al ghul and darkseid he founds lexcorp and uses his pr resources and media control to set himself up as a near savior in metropolis the daily planet opposes luthor and he retaliates in ways that leave the newspaper almost bankrupt superman s arrival challenges luthor s image and brings renewed interest to the planet when he does exclusive interviews with their staff clark kent jimmy olsen and lois lane work together to oppose luthor s power and superman tells the public they should strive to achieve great things themselves and not wait for others to be their saviors angry at superman s interference and blaming him for losing the love of the public luthor swears vengeance following changes to continuity in 2016 s dc rebirth the history from superman secret origin is still largely intact though it has also been revealed that for a time lionel luthor worked as a scientist for vandal savage and that this led to a brief friendship between lex and j onn j onzz the martian manhunter when both were children fictional character biography edit whether he is a mad scientist corrupt businessman or both luthor s ego is a defining trait in all his incarnations he believes he is entitled to both popularity and power while each incarnation initially wants the adoration of others and control over either smallville or metropolis the goal eventually rises to control over earth and possibly universal domination luthor s other defining trait is his obsession to destroy superman and humiliate the alien hero either by displaying his own superiority by achieving victory without the benefit of superpowers or to prove the man of steel is motivated by selfish desire rather than altruism many times luthor has claimed he could create a better way of life for the entire human race if not for superman s interference with his work he has even argued that the man of tomorrow s presence not only invites danger it actually encourages human society not to strive for greatness because a powerful alien is around to protect them and solve problems during the blackest night crossover wonder woman restrains luthor with her magic lasso and under its spell of truth he confesses he secretly wants to be superman revealing that beneath all his blustering luthor covets superman s powers for himself 29 when superman was out of sight for a year 30 luthor used the time to create the everyman project intending to create new superheroes to replace the kryptonian then later attacks metropolis with a long buried kryptonian warship returning to action superman points out that luthor had a year to prove his old argument that he could help others and improve earth if superman didn t interfere with his life but instead of curing disease or making technological breakthroughs all he did was focus on increasing his power and finding a big destructive machine so he could break things 31 in the storyline the black ring luthor is endowed with cosmic powers that could enable him to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe and therefore achieve his dream of being more respected than superman but he ultimately chooses to renounce his new powers when he realizes that his greatest enemy would never suffer again if he used them 32 at times lex has been shown evidence that clark kent is superman and almost always he denies this possibility unable to imagine a man of such power spending half his time pretending to be average since in his mind such a possibility would be too humiliating to bear in stories appearing in jla and 52 by grant morrison luthor cannot bring himself to believe superman is truly altruistic and deeply cares about a planet that is not his native world concluding the hero s good deeds are often actually passive aggressive ways of flaunting his power and popularity to lex when the hero joins forces with others to form a new powerful version of the justice league of america lex decides this is superman s direct challenge to his own power and establishes an injustice league composed of various supervillains to rival them 33 silver age edit while the golden age luthor later named alexei luthor is simply an amoral and brilliant man driven by a simple desire for power the silver age incarnation was given a more developed personality and backstory teenage lex luthor is an aspiring scientist who resides in smallville and greatly admires its local hero superboy after lex saves him from kryptonite the boy of steel builds him a private laboratory in gratitude after thousands of experiments the young scientist creates an artificial life form of primitive protoplasm overjoyed he accidentally causes a chemical fire in the lab superboy puts out the fire inadvertently spilling other chemicals destroying the artificial life form and the accumulated research notes that led to its creation the chemical fumes also cause lex s hair to completely fall out enraged he has lost years of research but unwilling to accept responsibility for the fire luthor concludes superboy intentionally sabotaged his work jealous of the young scientist s achievements and swears revenge 34 luthor creates grandiose engineering projects to prove his superiority over the superhero but each one fails and causes problems that superboy then solves luthor then makes his first attempt to murder the last son of krypton and fails instead of bringing him to the authorities superboy declares they are even now and expresses hope lex will straighten out and use his intelligence to help humanity rather than try to prove his superiority or waste time seeking power and vengeance 35 superman s girl friend lois lane 23 1961 reveals the silver age lex luthor parents are jules and arlene and that he has a younger sister lena when lex becomes a criminal the family moves away from smallville and changes its name to thorul an anagram to start a new life free of him lena thorul is a toddler at the time and grows up not remembering her real last name while her parents say her older brother died in a mountain climbing accident lex later watches over the adult lena making sure she does not discover her connection to one of earth s greatest villains as an adult lex luthor s driving ambitions are to kill superman and rule earth a stepping stone to dominating the universe believing a man of his intellect deserves such power 36 on several occasions he joins forces with superman s enemy brainiac though the two often betray each other as well lex is repeatedly imprisoned but his genius allows him to routinely escape he also makes it a point to be out of prison on the birthday of albert einstein regarding it as a holiday 24 a famous non canonical imaginary story from 1961 entitled the death of superman has luthor finally succeed in killing superman after pretending to reform and befriend him 37 38 on a distant arid planet orbiting a red star luthor challenges superman to a fight since kryptonians lose power when exposed to red sun radiation befriending the planet s inhabitants luthor aids them in rediscovering lost technology that restores the water supply and helps the society rebuild as a result luthor becomes a hero in the eyes of the planet whereas his enemy superman is detested as a villain the people rename the planet lexor and it becomes a regular home base and retreat for luthor in between his efforts to fight superman and take over earth 39 he later meets a local woman named ardora first called tharla but renamed ardora in later stories as well as the reprint of her first appearance the two eventually fall in love and marry 40 bronze age edit lex luthor in his lexorian warsuit from action comics 544 june 1983 art by george perez deciding to retire permanently luthor returns to lexor and learns he has fathered a son by ardora lex luthor jr he spends the next several weeks with his new family before discovering lexor suffers from the same planetary instability that destroyed krypton while creating a neutrarod tower to stabilize the planetary core luthor s pathological hatred for superman resurfaces and he reflects on feeling unsatisfied in life without their conflict the villain then unearths an ancient underground laboratory of great technology a relic from lexor s lost age after one of luthor s still active satellites threatens the people of earth he concludes superman will soon come to lexor to take him back to earth authorities with the underground lab s resources he spends weeks creating a highly destructive flight capable war suit later simply called a warsuit to finally match the kryptonian in physical combat and counter his powers to test the suit luthor performs several acts of destruction on lexor feigning ignorance when he hears about the mystery marauder and telling ardora he has no knowledge of the armored man when superman arrives luthor dons his warsuit and attacks now obsessed with the need to best the hero in combat and prove his superiority the people of lexor are shocked to realize he is the mystery marauder and does not care about the harm he has caused them during the battle luthor releases an energy salvo that accidentally overloads the neutrarod resulting in the complete destruction of the planet lexor and all its inhabitants including ardora and lex jr similar to how he reacted after the destruction of his lab in smallville lex is unable to process his grief and accept his responsibility for lexor s destruction he psychologically blocks part of his own memory to convince himself superman is at fault renewing his need for vengeance in his subsequent stories he regularly uses the lexorian warsuit 41 the warsuit was designed by george pérez 42 as part of the super powers toyline in the early 1980s before being introduced into the comics in 1983 43 the suit vanished in 1986 after crisis on infinite earths rebooted dc comics continuity but was reintroduced in 2004 now said to be built with a combination of earth and alien technology including tech from the other dimensional world apokolips and armed with different forms of kryptonite in the gauntlet 44 lex luthor of earth one team up with alexei luthor of earth two it is shown that alexei is arguable colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of earth in order to prove his superiority whereas lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die they even extend their alliance to ultraman when earth three s lex luthor is a good guy all three villains were defeated by superman of earth one superman of earth two and lex luthor of earth three 14 during the 12 issue limited series crisis on infinite earths luthor allies himself with fellow superman foe brainiac to recruit an army of supervillains spanning the dc multiverse alexei luthor is present and complains this army does not need two luthors

first seven marriages occurred off panel in luthor s past his eighth marriage to contessa erica alexandra del portenza a k a the contessa is based on mutual greed 111 the contessa buys controlling interest in lexcorp after luthor is indicted compelling him to marry her in order to regain control of his company the contessa becomes pregnant 112 and starts using the unborn child to dominate lex into doing her bidding luthor s response is to imprison her while she is drugged during childbirth keeping her in a permanently unconscious state the contessa later escapes to an island mansion 113 but upon being elected president luthor targets her home with a barrage of missiles and destroys it 114 luthor s daughter lena was the avatar of the tech the remnant cyberware of metropolis after brainiac 13 s advancing the city to a futuristic state was undone james d hudnall s lex luthor the unauthorized biography further expands on luthor s origin the story details how luthor was sent to live with a foster family following the sabotage of his parents car his foster parents casey and emily griggs conspire to embezzle his insurance and coerce their daughter lena into seducing lex to learn the location of the money due to her genuine romantic feelings toward lex lena refuses and is beaten to death by her father lex is absent from the home at the time of the murder having been talked into going to a football game by his schoolmate perry white 115 once he has established his preeminence in metropolis luthor takes vengeance on griggs secretly hiring him to assassinate frank berkowitz the city s popular four term mayor who refuses to knuckle under to luthor s dominance then personally killing him once the deed is done 116 as an adult perry s unwitting role in lena s death motivates luthor to have an affair with perry s wife alice during a period when perry is missing and assumed dead alice becomes pregnant shortly afterward though the timing of the conception means an equal possibility of either luthor or white being the father the child jerry white later learns his true parentage during his late teens shortly before being killed by a local street gang he is associated with the loss of a potential heir weighs heavily on luthor s mind particularly when he is dying of cancer while mulling over his fate luthor visits jerry s gravesite 117 luthor has shown an unusual level of compassion for conner kent a hybrid clone created from the dna of superman and luthor himself after conner s death at the conclusion of the infinite crisis luthor is shown visiting a memorial statue of conner in metropolis and placing flowers there 118 more than once luthor addresses conner as his son following conner s resurrection luthor is shocked and decides to locate him when brainiac accuses him of showing paternal feelings for conner though luthor denies it saying that he only wants his property back and has no fatherly feelings towards superboy after superboy and luthor visit lena luthor makes it clear he now sees kon el as an inherently failed experiment due to having 50 wrong alien dna luthor then works with brainiac to create a binary clone with their own genetics a possible threat to superboy in the alternate future timeline of titans tomorrow 119 conner becomes an uncompromising and dictatorial successor to superman while luthor acts as a caring father figure to him 120 during the blackest night storyline lex luthor s father lionel luthor was featured where it was revealed that he died of an allergic reaction to his medicine during clark kent s days as superboy he is reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps where he is amongst its members that try to attack lex luthor after the events of blackest night luthor went on to build a gynoid version of lois lane using brainiac technology his primary purpose for creating her was to have a companion who would voice honest opinions and provide an extra voice of reason to counsel him on his obsessive quest for the black lantern energy luthor also had a pseudo romantic relationship with the loisbot and regularly slept with it 121 powers and abilities edit lex luthor has the physical capabilities of a normal adult human with no metahuman abilities however for virtually his entire publication history he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the dc universe and one of the most intelligent beings of any planet he possesses an eidetic memory and has mastered seemingly every known form of science including space travel extra dimensional travel biochemistry robotics computers synthetic polymers communications mutations transportation holography energy generation spectral analysis and time travel with the exception of the extraterrestrial entity known as brainiac and occasionally batman luthor does not view any other being as an intellectual peer his exceptional intellectual gifts act as his superpowers allowing him to craft advanced weapons and equipment outthink opponents much stronger and more powerful than himself and manipulate others into doing his bidding his genius also extends to business he is one of the world s wealthiest people and politics he was elected u s president and he is often the leader of super villain groups he has belonged to luthor has been trained in hand to hand combat specifically karate 122 he has also been occasionally trained by the amazons of themyscira weaponry edit over the years luthor has created either on his own using alien technology he acquires or with the resources of lexcorp and the military many highly advanced weapons machines and robots to carry out his plans or destroy his enemies he has made liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of injuring superman and other kryptonians and he has often created synthetic kryptonite not as lethal as real green kryptonite but still capable of weakening a kryptonian since the bronze age he has also utilized various high tech war suits in many stories the first warsuit introduced in 1983 was a product of lost science from an earlier age in the planet lexor s history when technology was highly advanced its lexorian materials can withstand several attacks by superman before sustaining damage and its force field offers further protection still wearing it grants lex great superhuman strength not equal to superman but still enough to overpower many of earth s heroes the suit can deliver powerful energy blasts and a molecular sheath capable of blocking superman s body from absorbing energy from solar radiation meaning his powers will weaken over time powered by red solar radiation the suit can also deliver red solar beams to directly weaken superman the suit has other features including advanced sensor systems a hypnotism weapon and illusion casting technology the warsuit introduced in 2004 is built with technology from apokolips granting greater superhuman strength and resistance to injury a powerful force field flight electrical weapons and a variety of kryptonite based weaponry such as energy cannons axes and a collapsible sword its power is great enough that luthor could fly for several days without interruption the gauntlets hold different forms of kryptonite stones after reality is altered by flashpoint luthor uses a new warsuit similar to the 2004 one but slimmer and built by reverse engineering kryptonian technology when he temporarily attempts to act as a hero and works alongside the justice league luthor uses a similar warsuit with non lethal weaponry and no kryptonite based features luthor often wore a kryptonite ring on his right hand in post crisis stories but abandoned this tactic after prolonged exposure to its radiation resulted in cancer requiring him to transplant his brain into a cloned body to survive while masquerading as his own son lex luthor ii lex occasionally wore high tech lx 20 body armor during the blackest night crossover he wore an orange power ring of avarice created by ganthet a former member of the guardians of the universe alternate versions edit dc comics often depicts its stories as taking place in a wide multiverse with many parallel realities where familiar characters have slightly or drastically different lives likewise there are some comics published under the elseworlds label meaning it is a story that is outside of canon and does not necessarily have a specific universe designation such as earth 3 or earth x the point of elseworlds stories is to reimagine familiar characters in new settings while many versions of luthor are similar to the mainstream one simply existing in different settings some significant famous and or recurring alternate versions of the character include earth three edit earth three was introduced during the silver age of comics as a mirror version of the dc comics earth where americans colonized europe and actor abraham lincoln shot president john wilkes booth an evil version of the justice league known as the crime syndicate of america terrorizes this world eventually a heroic scientist named alexander luthor opposes them donning a high tech red yellow and blue supersuit during his initial adventure he is aided by the supermen of earth two and earth two as well as earth 3 s noble reporter lois lane at the time when ultraman collaborated with lex luthor of earth one and alexei luthor of earth two 14 later alex and lois marry and have a child alexander luthor jr who aids earth s heroes during the crisis on infinite earths and then opposes them in the crossover infinite crisis 123 earth 3 edit the new 52 timeline introduced its own version of earth 3 in the crossover forever evil 2014 the alexander luthor of this earth 3 is his world s version of shazam 124 called mazahs he takes the superpowers of those he kills and is the father of superwoman s child he is later killed by the new 52 version of lex luthor 91 following the reboot of the multiverse at the end of dark nights death metal as seen during the infinite frontier earth 3 is recreated with a new version of alexander luthor this version is a non superpowered african american man who wears a suit of high tech armour he is the sworn enemy of ultraman the self appointed ruler and protector of metropolis and one of the few people with the courage to defy him directly he is depicted as well intentioned and compassionate but largely ineffectual he is horrified when earth 3 s evil metahumans are hailed as heroes for defeating the invading starros aided by former emerald knight thaal sinestro and a new god named lonar he begins recruiting good metahumans into a legion of justice most of the group is defeated and luthor is imprisoned by ultraman 125 anti matter earth edit the anti matter universe is a dark often opposite reflection of the mainstream dc universe that is similar to earth three armed with a green and purple high tech warsuit the alexander luthor of this reality regularly opposes the crime syndicate of amerika a group of villains who rule over his earth through fear and coercion at one point this luthor journeys to the mainstream dc comics earth which he decides to call earth 2 in hopes that the justice league can save his world the team tries but realize that they cannot win for long on the anti matter earth because evil holds sway in this universe metaphysically because lucifer defeated archangel michael and thus wins more often meaning heroes are fated to ultimately fail or die this idea presented in the graphic novel jla earth 2 was a meta commentary by writer grant morrison on the fact that in the main dc universe it is accepted by readers that good tends to triumph over evil 126 batman the dark knight strikes again edit in batman the dark knight strikes again set in a world where heroes have been publicly retired for years lex luthor is depicted as obese with a hunchback he has teamed up with brainiac and controls the u s government using a hologram known as president rickard as a figurehead he has also blackmailed superman wonder woman and captain marvel into doing the government s bidding by holding their loved ones hostage when batman and catgirl emerge from hiding they take on luthor and batman slashes a z into luthor s face before leaving in retaliation he orders superman and wonderman to kill an alien which is really brainiac hoping superman would get killed that plan however failed when his daughter lara saved him then luthor launched satellites to destroy most of the world s population but they were destroyed by the green lantern lex luthor is eventually killed by the son of hawkman and hawkgirl 127 bizarro luthor edit in multiple versions of dc comics canon superman s imperfect duplicate bizarro sometimes called bizarro 1 creates an entire bizarro world htrae populated by imperfect and backwards thinking duplicates of the people of earth one such duplicate is bizarro luthor another version of bizarro luthor is said to exist on earth 29 a parallel reality called the bizarroverse earth 47 edit introduced in year of the villain lex luthor 1 2019 this lex luthor studies and uses the black mercy an alien plant that feeds off an organism s psychic energy while distracting them with an illusion of the life they want through repeated use lex experiences multiple scenarios where he acquires the great power and or superpowers he always wanted but finds he is never satisfied realizing his ambitions are based on ego while superman regularly considers how his actions will affect or benefit others this luthor spends the rest of his life creating new ways for people to heal and live better lives amalgam comics edit during the crossover dc vs marvel the realities of dc comics and marvel comics temporarily merged resulting in the amalgam comics universe in this reality lex luthor s person and history merged with that of the red skull creating the green skull a war profiteer during world war ii this lex luthor later injects himself with a chemical agent derived from a radioactive green meteorite extending his lifespan while giving him green skin and his head a skull like appearance in multiple amalgam comics stories he opposes super soldier a combination of superman and captain america earth c minus edit there is a version of lex luthor who is a villainous lemur that inhabits earth c minus or earth c a parallel world populated by anthropomorphic animals and protected by super squirrel 128 pocket universe version edit inhabiting a pocket universe created by the villainous time trapper this young luthor never loses his hair and admires the exploits of superboy a teenage clark kent on his world after superboy s death luthor explores the hero s lab and accidentally frees three pocket universe kryptonian villains from the phantom zone to help the situation luthor creates an artificial life form out of a pseudo plasm matrix based on the physical traits of lana lang the life form is called supergirl after the kryptonian villains kill luthor and all other life forms on earth the pocket universe supergirl makes a new home on the mainstream dc comics earth where she becomes a hero 129 superman earth one edit in the second of the superman earth one graphic novels dr alexandra luthor and her husband dr alexander luthor are a pair of brilliant scientists who refer to themselves as lex2 incorporated while working with the military alexandra researches ways of killing superman as an intellectual exercise while alexander is more compassionate and questions the ethics of developing weapons to harm a man who has not given cause to be feared 130 in the third installment alexander sacrifices himself to help superman battle zod alexandra is consumed by grief blaming the man of steel and vowing to destroy him claiming the old alexandra died alongside her husband she adopts the new name lex 131 elseworlds edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november 2021 versions of lex luthor have appeared in different elseworlds stories in the elseworlds graphic novel speeding bullets kal el is adopted by thomas and martha wayne who have no other son and name him bruce years after witnessing his parents murder bruce becomes a super powered batman in gotham city while lex luthor operates without interference in metropolis acquiring great power and influence an accident at a chemical plant leads luthor to acquire chalk white skin and blood red lips initially hiding his disfigurement he later reveals his new appearance and adopts the name the joker a similar character simply called lex joker appears in a dream reality where familiar dc characters are combined with each other 132 a four issue elsewords miniseries titled kingdom come is later said to take place on earth 22 after a rise of violent anti heroes and vigilantes is embraced by the public superman and many other traditional heroes retire or leave later when superman and many of his former allies return to action now acting more authoritative and militaristic an older lex luthor argues this is the first step towards superhumans ruling earth he gathers the mankind liberation front to oppose superman s justice league to protect himself from enemies luthor brainwashes the hero captain marvel into becoming his bodyguard a three issue

luthor a respected scientific prodigy in america who is married to daily planet reporter lois lane luthor this superman acts as a powerful political figure on his world while luthor is increasingly convinced that the kryptonian s presence is halting human progress 133 he engineers several schemes to destroy the man of steel all of which fail before finally convincing superman that he has no right to interfere in human affairs superman fakes his death to live as a normal man and luthor turns his attention to advancing the human race ultimately becoming mankind s greatest mind and savior

references 13 external links creation edit writer jerry siegel first conceived lois lane in 1934 when siegel and joe shuster were still developing superman 3 one of the major influence on lois characterization was actress glenda farrell and her portrayal of the fictional reporter torchy blane in a series of warner bros films the torchy blane movies were popular second features during the later 1930s on the conception of lois lane siegel stated in the 1988 time magazine my wife joanne was joe s original art model for superman s girlfriend lois lane back in the 1930s our heroine was of course a working girl whose priority was grabbing scoops what inspired me in the creation was glenda farrell the movie star who portrayed torchy blane a gutsy beautiful headline hunting reporter in a series of exciting motion pictures because the name of the actress lola lane who also played torchy appealed to me i called my character lois lane strangely the characterization of lois is amazingly like the real life personality of my lovely wife 4 an early sketch of lois lane by joe shuster modeled on joanne carter artist joe shuster based lois physical appearance on a model named joanne carter carter had placed an ad in the cleveland plain dealer newspaper in the situation wanted column advertising herself as a model 5 shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for lois lane shuster s depiction of lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features to me she was lois lane she was a great inspiration for me though she encouraged me she was very enthusiastic about the strip it meant a lot to me shuster said about joanne carter 6 joanne carter married co creator jerry siegel in 1948 on working with joe shuster for lois lane carter said in the 1983 nemo magazine interview joe was redrawing the strip and it was going to be more realistic rather than cartoony i used to model for him every saturday until he had enough drawings he made so many stock drawings that it got to a point where he didn t need any more we became such good friends by that time we decided we would always stay friends 6 publication history edit lois lane made her debut in action comics 1

the 1940s lois began to suspect that clark kent was superman and started to make various attempts at uncovering his secret identity all of which backfired because of superman s efforts the first such story appears in superman 17 july august 1942 17 this theme became particularly pronounced in the 1950s and 1960s silver age comic books lois gained her first series of stories without superman

bizarre plots lois main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival lana lang for superman s affections attempting to prove clark kent and superman were one and the same or otherwise getting superman into marriage superman s rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden regardless lois married several times in the superman stories of this era including to a superman impostor from kandor the villainous zak kul 21 and a man from the future 22 all these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten lois became more and more popular during the 1950s and after appearing as the lead character in two issues of dc comics showcase in 1957 dc created an ongoing series for lois titled superman s girl friend lois lane 23 24 the series ran for 137 issues beginning in april 1958 to october 1974 most stories were about lois romance with superman and were drawn by artist kurt schaffenberger schaffenberger s rendition of lois became cited by many as the definitive version of lois and he was often asked by dc editor mort weisinger to redraw other artists depictions of lois lane in other dc titles where she appeared 25 26 so many stories depicted lois and marriage that the cover of a 1968 80 page giant that reprinted several such stories the all wedding issue described the magazine as featuring lois schemes and dreams to marry superman 27 superman s girl friend lois lane 1 april 1958 art by curt swan and stan kaye the series superman s girl friend lois lane became one of dc s most popular titles the third best selling comic in 1962 and 1965 11 28 the title featured the first appearance of the silver age catwoman after an absence from the comics for over a decade 29 while lois is suspicious of superman s secret identity as early as superman 7 1940 her suspicions grew during the early silver age with many stories in her series focusing on her attempts to prove superman and clark kent were one and the same stories showed superman using various means to protect his secret identity from lois including his superman robots or batman disguising himself as clark superman 30 by the end of the 1960s as attitudes toward women s role in american society changed lois character changed as well in superman s girl friend lois lane 80 jan 1968 the character s fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look 31 stories in the 1970s depicted lois again as fully capable and less reliant on superman she engaged in more adventures without superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering superman s secret identity lois had a series featured in the superman family an anthology title started in the mid 1970s after the cancellation of superman s girl friend lois lane and superman s pal jimmy olsen from 1974 to 1982 in her series lois regularly battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the kryptonian martial art of klurkor taught to her by kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of kandor 32 there were several cameos of the new gods including desaad and darkseid lois lane was the backup series in the daring new adventures of supergirl in 1982 to 1983 33 during the silver and bronze age lois backstory became more fully fleshed out with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the daily planet this backstory was attributed to the lois lane of earth one 34 as summarized in various stories lois was born to sam and ella lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of pittsdale 8 at the age of two lois suffered measles and at the age of three whooping cough 35 at an unspecified time during lois childhood her younger sister lucy lane was born 35 while lois was a toddler she encountered a rattlesnake in the woods near the lane family farm the snake was scared away by one of kal el s baby toys which had landed nearby in one of jor el s experimental rockets 36 during lois adolescence she won a youth contest run by the daily planet with the prize being a trip to metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper there she first met clark kent of smallville who was the other winner of the contest lois found clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about superboy after learning clark came from smallville during the week in metropolis lois made a bet with clark to see who would get the most scoops which turned out to be lois as clark was forced to constantly go into action as superboy lois met superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories at the end of the week clark paid off lois bet an ice cream sundae and the two returned to their respective hometowns 37 lois would meet superboy but not clark kent again during her adolescence while attending an all girls summer camp near smallville there lois met lana lang a fellow camper for the first time 38 lois would make further attempts at landing a job with the daily planet during her teenage years 39 and spent time writing for her hometown s newspaper the pittsdale star 8 upon finishing high school lois left pittsdale and attended raleigh college to study journalism while in college lois worked for the student newspaper the raleigh review as a reporter and eventually its co editor 40 after graduating from college lois became permanently employed at the daily planet clark kent and jimmy olsen later joined the planet s staff but lois remained the newspaper s star reporter 41 winning the pulitzer prize 42 she was very dependent on superman however he told her that having to rescue her so often from problems she caused prevented him from helping others 43 for example when late for a deadline lois jumped off a cliff expecting superman to catch her as he has done a thousand times and fly her to her destination 44 when asked on a sunday morning talk show what she would do if trapped in an underground mine with rescue impossible before the air ran out lois admitted that she would impatiently await superman because i ve got a deadline to meet 45 eventually lois realized that she had wasted a good part of her career by staying in metropolis for superman s sake and left 46 as both a journalist and as a woman she had to get on with her life 47 after the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths writer john byrne revised the superman legend and eliminated the silver age version of lois from continuity before this happened a final non canonical imaginary story whatever happened to the man of tomorrow was written by alan moore meant as a send off for the pre crisis versions of the characters including lois published at the same time but in earth one continuity was a two issue miniseries lois lane in which she investigates missing children 48 49 modern age edit lois lane as she appears on the cover of the man of steel 2 october 1986 art by john byrne lois underwent a character alteration beginning with john byrne s the man of steel miniseries which significantly rewrote superman s origin and history in this modern version of events lois was portrayed as a tough as nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing she was depicted as strong opinionated yet sensitive lois first real relationship in this version was with jose delgado who she later discovered acted as a vigilante josé s legs are shattered in a battle with a lexcorp cyborg human hybrid gone amok delgado eventually recovered he and lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated due to delgado accepting help from a lexcorp subsidiary arl 50 51 another major change made was that lois did not fall in love with just superman although she was attracted to him one reason was the revised nature of the superman clark kent relationship in the original silver age stories superman had been the man who disguised himself as clark kent in this newly revised concept it was clark kent who lived a life in which his activity as superman was decidedly secondary lois initially resented the rookie clark kent getting the story on superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview this sometimes ill tempered rivalry remained the case until the adventures of superman 460 463 and action comics 650 following clark s brief rampage under the influence of the eradicator lois was hesitant to forgive clark for selling out to collin thornton and running newstime magazine but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to ask for his job back clark elected to repay lois by finally letting go of his self imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her the two became a couple and eventually lois accepted a proposal of marriage 12 13 clark shortly after revealed to her that he was superman 52 53 dc comics had planned on lois and clark being married in 1993 s superman vol 2 75 with the then upcoming television show lois clark the new adventures of superman dc decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on tv partially as a result of this superman was killed in superman 75 instead dying in lois arms after a battle royal with the monster doomsday after a period of time superman returned to life and both he and lois resumed their relationship though not without a few problems such as a brief reappearance of clark s former college girlfriend the mermaid

comic books published by dc comics kalibak is the eldest son of darkseid the half brother of orion and grayven and an enemy of superman and the justice league 1 2 created by jack kirby being debuted with the rest of the new gods first appearing in new gods 1 february 1971 in an era called the silver age of comic books he is originally and recurrently depicted as the brutish son of darkseid commonly seeking affection of his father who he had a tragic childhood with he is also depicted as second in command as leader of apokolips and rival to another of darkseid son orion 3 kalibak s name is derived from the william shakespeare character name caliban the half man from the tempest 4 5 6 7 kalibak is the first born son of darkseid and suli his mother suli is killed by desaad acting under orders from kalibak s grandmother queen heggra kalibak becomes a legendary warrior and often serves as darkseid s second in command after darkseid breaks the pact of peace with new genesis the rival planet of kalibak s home apokolips he aids his father in the resulting battles 8 kalibak is often pitted against orion and after numerous clashes they learned that they were half brothers this fuels kalibak s hatred of orion to new levels for darkseid clearly respects orion over his first born unlike orion kalibak secretly craves the love and respect of his father something neither he nor anyone else can ever hope to attain and it has been shown that he has a gentle side which is completely submerged under his brutish exterior and which he consistently and fearfully keeps hidden because on apokolips any sign of weakness is subject to the cruelest punishment for his part darkseid is more lenient towards kalibak s failures than those of his other servants having slain him he always returns him to life it is implied this is because his eldest son is the offspring of the one person darkseid truly loved as well being one of the only few of his followers with genuine loyalty at one point kalibak is desperate enough to confront orion without darkseid s consent kalibak s scheme fell apart and he kills his accomplice desaad also a servant of darkseid to cover his tracks darkseid was not pleased when he found out and reduced his son to a pile of ash after enough time had passed darkseid resurrected kalibak hoping the boy had learned a lesson kalibak later spends some time in an apokolips prison on darkseid s orders in orion 1 june 2000 darkseid is on earth when orion invades apokolips justeen a servant of desaad releases kalibak to battle orion yet again kalibak is swiftly subdued but does not care much as orion leaves to battle darkseid and kalibak hopes to gain power as a result during the universe wide genesis incident apokolips forces including kalibak invade earth in young heroes in love 5 kalibak and his small squad of parademons are defeated by the leader of the young heroes the telekinetic and telepathic hard drive 9 kalibak is slain by his uncle infinity man who has been murdering the residents of apokolips and new genesis as an agent of the source wall in death of the new gods in final crisis the new fifth world and human version of kalibak appears alongside darkseid calling himself dark side seemingly reborn in a new form alongside his father and a human kanto this form is later replaced with a humanoid tiger like form engineered by simyan and mokkari he is seen devouring a green lantern named opto 10 he leads a regiment of tiger soldiers against the heroes in blüdhaven but he is killed in combat with tawky tawny before he dies he begs his soldiers to help they refuse as they only follow the strong they then bow to tawny as kalibak dies in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe kalibak is a loyal follower of darkseid backing him up in a war against the anti monitor he does have a problem with slaying apokolips soldiers that literally get in the way between him and the enemy 11 kalibak possesses high levels of superhuman strength endurance and durability despite his muscular bulk he is surprisingly fast and agile as well 12 like all beings of the fourth world he is immortal kalibak is a highly trained hand to hand combatant known on apokolips for his savagery 13 he is armed with a beta club a weapon that fires force bolts or nerve beams that causes living beings agonizing pain beyond comprehension it is nearly indestructable though orion once destroyed it with some assistance from lightray 14 he can also summon and use aero disks which allow him to fly 12 kalibak also has access to high tech weapons of mass destruction physically kalibak is one of the strongest gods on apokolips and the most loyal to darkseid this is what makes kalibak an indispensable member of darkseid s elite kalibak possesses incredible levels of superhuman strength almost on par with superman orion and even darkseid himself once he had been augmented by his father in an effort to secure the life equation from an elemental wielder darkseid had bestowed his son with vastly augmented might and menace enabling him to physically overpower his once far stronger brother orion in combat even granting him the ability of psi beams which are an omega effect like psionic blast which spike individual minds with blinding amounts of mental agony 15 alternate versions of kalibak edit in the tie in comics to injustice gods among us kalibak travels to earth after superman calls a peace treaty where he attacks him after vanquishing the parademon with kalibak superman engages kalibak in battle

in other media edit kalibak appeared in the last two incarnations of the original animated series super friends voiced by frank welker his appearance was not as brutish as later tv incarnations more

michael dorn kalibak was featured on superman the animated series like in the comics he seeks to earn his father s approval he appears in father s day where he desaad and bruno mannheim watch superman fight one of desaad s robots he even pleaded to his father to fight superman but darkseid denied that with kalibak immediately complying kalibak was manipulated by desaad to go to earth so that he can fight superman so could prove himself despite his initial reluctance and distrust in desaad s suggestion kalibak and superman fight it out in metropolis on father s day darkseid later finds out about this even when he forced the answers out of desaad superman managed to send kalibak flying into the nearby park by the time superman caught up with kalibak darkseid arrived and withdrew kalibak back

then thwarted by batman until superman arrives who knocks him out in one punch during a second attack he ended up engaging lobo in battle and lost when lobo buried him beneath an enormous pile of cars forcing him to literally cry uncle in justice league unlimited darkseid s death created a power struggle on apokolips with kalibak as darkseid s son whoever could bend him to their will could claim control of the planet granny goodness appeared before mister miracle and big barda to free kalibak from the x pits where virman vundabar was holding him in order for granny goodness to release oberon

dull witted than his comics version when the parademons abduct daily planet reporter sid sharp in a mock superman outfit upon mistaking him for superman kalibak assists desaad granny goodness and kanto in darkseid s plot to lure superman into a kryptonite trap kalibak wanted darkseid to give him a hug if the plan worked sid sharp tricks the four villains into competing against one another to

comics and adaptations into other media lana has most consistently been depicted as superman s teenage romantic interest growing up in smallville as an adult she is a friend of superman in his civilian identity as clark kent lana is one of many superman characters with the alliterative initials ll the most notable other examples being superman s primary love interest lois lane and archnemesis lex luthor in the silver age she regularly appeared in comic books depicting the adventures of superman s teenaged self superboy and also appeared as an adult in numerous superman titles vying with lois lane for his attention in modern revisions of dc comics continuity she and clark are shown to have remained friends since their teenage years the story varies across different revisions of superman s origin story for example in superman secret origin lana becomes privy to clark s unusual abilities at an early age and becomes his earliest confidant outside of his parents and the futuristic legion of super heroes fictional character biography edit silver age and bronze age edit earth one version edit lana lang and clark kent from the new adventures of superboy 3 march 1980 art by kurt schaffenberger in the original superboy stories lana was the girl who lived next door to the kent family in smallville and was a romantic interest of superboy 2 in the silver age stories lana often behaved like a younger version of lois lane spending much of her time trying to prove that superboy and clark kent were one and the same 3 at one point lana once rescued an insect like alien trapped by a fallen tree in smallville in gratitude the alien gave her a bio genetic ring which allowed lana to gain insect and insect like such as arachnids characteristics lana created a yellow honeybee like costume and mask and took the name insect queen under which identity lana had several adventures 4 lana also had various adventures with superboy and several with the futuristic superhero team the legion of super heroes 5 also appearing in some silver age stories was lana s uncle professor potter an eccentric inventor 6 after clark and lana graduated from high school lana went to college and eventually became a television reporter for metropolis tv station wmet tv 7 as an adult lana became a rival to lois lane for superman s affection in various 1960s stories often appearing in the lois lane comics series superman s girlfriend lois lane during the 1970s and early 1980s lana became an anchorwoman for wgbs tv s evening news in metropolis as a co anchor to clark kent 8 her attraction to superman during this time had also died off leaving superman to lois lane lana later became romantically linked to the alien super hero vartox 9 eventually she and clark kent became romantically involved in stories prior to the crisis on infinite earths earth two version edit in the early 1980s with the use of the multiverse system dc had in place lana lang was also shown in several stories to have had an earth two counterpart earth two at the time the home of the justice society of america and dc s golden age versions of its characters versus its mainstream universe of earth one the earth two lana lang was introduced in superman family 203 in this story lana lang joins the daily star as a television critic on earth two lana s father left smallville and moved to metropolis as a young man so clark did not know lana in his youth later she became an insect queen like her earth one counterpart in this case lana had received a mystic amulet from her archaeologist father amulet having been created to allow a pharaoh to control and divert the locust hordes that threatened ancient egypt however the sound of approaching insect wings was set to energize the charm associated with the amulet by unfortunate coincidence the sound of superman s super speed flying was similar enough to activate the spell lana was thus compelled to create a chitinous golden brown costume woven by silkworms under her control and adopt a villainous alter ego the insect queen after an initial clash with superman the insect queen fell under the mental influence of superman s enemy the ultra humanite who kept her under the spell s compulsion and prevented her from reverting to normal earth two s superman was able to locate an antidote to the spell which lois lane used to remove the compulsion superman family 213 letting lana break free of ultra s influence and making her able to use the amulet s power at her own discretion the earth 2 insect queen would later use her abilities to aid superman in times of need this version of lana lang was retconned out of existence after the events of crisis on infinite earths modern age edit after the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths was written various aspects of lana s history were retconned starting with comics writer john byrne s miniseries the man of steel which was designed to rewrite superman s origin from scratch in the post crisis version of events lana was a childhood friend of clark with a certain degree of romantic tension in the air as lana had long pined after clark who had loved her only platonically in return 10 after they graduated from high school clark took lana on a private walk saying that he had to tell her something important which lana honestly expected to be a marriage proposal he then divulged to her that he had superpowers displayed by flying her around the world before explaining that he felt he had to leave smallville to help humanity as a whole kissing her goodbye like a brother lana was left in considerable shock not only over the revelation of clark s superpowers but also over the final realization that he held no reciprocal romantic feelings towards her leaving lana heartbroken and alone when lana finally aired her grievance with him years later the man of steel 6 clark felt very badly over how he had hurt her when clark appeared in public as superman some years later the lonely and depressed lana deduced his true identity and became something of a stalker to the extent that lex luthor noticed the frequency with which she appeared in the vicinity of the hero and actually had her tortured in an attempt to gain whatever inside knowledge of superman she might have 11 lana bravely kept clark s identity a secret and upon his rescuing her their relationship became more healthy once again albeit still at a distance a long term conspiracy of the oan created androids the manhunters from whose control lana and the rest of smallville s children born around the same time as her were eventually freed proved to be the cause of this stalking unlike the pre crisis earth one continuity lana did not go on to have a journalistic career or compete with lois for superman s affections nor play a significant role in clark s life in metropolis lana s relationship with clark is again altered in 2003 s superman birthright limited series by mark waid which again revises superman s origins this storyline which takes some inspiration from the tv show smallville such as the appearance of ma and pa kent also shows clark and lana to have had a mutual romantic relationship during their youth at the start of the storyline lana has already left smallville prior to clark s return from his world journey upon his arrival home clark is told that lana left some time prior and no one has heard from her since following this storyline there is never again any mention of her history regarding clark or superman lana s birthright history has been yet again re made following the events of the infinite crisis which has revived clark s pre crisis superboy alter ego in this new history lana s two obnoxious brothers whom she lacked in previous versions often interrupted her romantic relationship with clark the full extent of her history and her connection to superboy clark has not been fully disclosed again her previous history has not been mentioned since this revision years later the post crisis lana eventually married pete ross volume issue needed the two settled into a quiet life in smallville where they had a son they named after their mutual friend clark they picked this name for their son after lana asked clark to save his life when a car accident caused him to be born eight weeks premature although the attack of the brainiac controlled doomsday interrupted clark s efforts to take the baby to receive care brainiac s subsequent attempts to use the baby s dna to create a new body for himself brought the baby to full term volume issue needed pete began a career in politics that got him elected to the senate volume issue needed in 2000 senator ross became lex luthor s vice presidential running mate in luthor s bid to become president and after the two won lana moved to washington d c eventually luthor was forced from his office and pete ross became president and lana the first lady as she and pete began to drift apart lana began to subtly attempt to regain clark s affections much to the anger of his now wife lois lane pete and lana briefly reunited after superman saved them from a murder attempt by the villainous ruin 12 in superman 654 perry white reported that lana had become ceo of lexcorp following the ousting of founder lex luthor in superman batman 49 it is revealed that she sold kryptonite to the government to prevent lexcorp from going under and had caches of kryptonite placed all over the planet as a last ditch defense if superman should ever go rogue when superman and batman come to remove the kryptonite lana refuses to hand it over and pushes a button which turns the caches into dirty bombs which spread kryptonite molecules through the entire planet forcing all kryptonians to vacate however toyman uses special nanobots to remove all of the kryptonite molecules undoing the damage superman meets with lana again with lana telling him she was left with no choice superman responds by telling her that while he does sometimes wonder what things would have been like if he had married her rather than lois there is a reason he is with lois instead of her lois would never have pushed the button after superman flies off someone is shown watching lana crying on a screen saying to her you did perfect in superman batman 63 suggests that this was gorilla grodd when batman mentions that grodd finally finished what he started when he controlled lana all those years ago however this scenario is later revealed to be a simulation created in the batcomputer she later tries to help superman facing the time traveling strongman atlas by sending the luthor squad this act activates a dormant program inside the lexcorp mainframes an holographic version of luthor the holographic copy of luthor informs lana that by helping superman she has violated the lexcorp standard contract of employment very very fine print that forbids lexcorp employees to use lexcorp resources for helping kryptonians under the penalty of termination lana is given five minutes to leave the building or they will shoot her to death 13 in 2008 a new supergirl writer sterling gates told newsarama about lana lang we re integrating supergirl s book more into the superman universe and that includes having a supporting cast that overlaps with that world i m very interested in tying her back in to metropolis and making sure that her world is a part of the superman universe cat grant will be a regular supporting cast member as will lana lang 14 lana takes it upon herself to reach out to supergirl she offers her advice and friendship around the same time perry white has been actively pursuing lana to take over the business section of the daily planet a position which lana was afraid to accept following her bad experience with lexcorp eventually lana and supergirl decide together that lana will accept the position and that supergirl will take on the secret identity of linda

hospital and brought into surgery she apparently dies on the operating table but black insect like creatures later encase her body in a cocoon which then starts to crack open 18 a gigantic cocoon like structure soon engulfs the hospital and an army of giant insects takes hostage a number of workers as well as the science police and the guardian supergirl is soon captured and awakens bound and gagged at the feet of lana whom the insect queen now possesses the queen reveals to supergirl that during her last encounter with lana she injected her with a portion of her dna and has been slowly

wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search explosion of a star at its end of life for other uses see supernova disambiguation sn 1994d bright spot on the lower left a type ia supernova within its host galaxy ngc 4526 a supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star it has the plural form supernovae viː or supernovas and is abbreviated sn or sne this transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion the original object called the progenitor either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or is completely destroyed the peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months supernovae are more energetic than novae in latin nova means new referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star adding the prefix super distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae which are far less luminous the word supernova was coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in 1929 the last supernova to be directly observed in the milky way was kepler s supernova in 1604 but the remnants of more recent supernovae have been found observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the milky way on average about three times every century these supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes the most recent naked eye supernova was sn 1987a which was the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the large magellanic cloud a satellite of the milky way theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms the sudden re ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star such as a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star s core in the first class of events the object s temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting the star possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion or a stellar merger in the massive star case the core of a massive star may undergo sudden collapse once it is unable to produce sufficient energy from fusion to counteract the star s own gravity while some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories the astrophysical mechanics are established and accepted by the astronomical community supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at velocities up to several percent of the speed of light this drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium the expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays

brief sometimes spanning several months so that the chances of observing one with the naked eye is roughly once in a lifetime only a tiny fraction of the 100 billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova being restricted to those having high mass and rare kinds of binary stars containing white dwarfs 1 early discoveries edit the earliest possible recorded supernova known as hb9 could have been viewed by unknown prehistoric people of indian subcontinent then recorded on a rock carving found in burzahama region in kashmir dated to 4500 1000 bc 2 later sn 185 was documented by chinese astronomers in 185 ad the brightest recorded supernova was sn 1006 which occurred in 1006 ad in the constellation of lupus this event was described by observers across china japan iraq egypt and europe 3 4 5 the widely observed supernova sn 1054 produced the crab nebula supernovae sn 1572 and sn 1604 the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the milky way galaxy had a notable influence on the development of astronomy in europe because they were used to argue against the aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the moon and planets was static and unchanging 6 johannes kepler began observing sn 1604 at its peak on 17 october 1604 and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later 7 it was the second supernova to be observed in a generation after sn 1572 seen by tycho brahe in cassiopeia 8 there is some evidence that the youngest galactic supernova g1 9 0 3 occurred in the late 19th century considerably more recently than cassiopeia a from around 1680 9 neither supernova was noted at the time in the case of g1 9 0 3 high extinction from dust along the plane of our galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently for it to go unnoticed the situation for cassiopeia a is less clear infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was not in a region of especially high extinction 10 the crab nebula is a pulsar wind nebula associated with the 1054 supernova a 1414 text cites a 1055 report since the baleful star appeared a full year has passed and until now its brilliance has not faded 11

telescope findings edit with the development of the astronomical telescope observation and discovery of fainter and more distant supernovae became possible the first such observation was of sn 1885a in the andromeda galaxy a second supernova sn 1895b was discovered in ngc 5253 a decade later 19 early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the 1920s these were variously called upper class novae hauptnovae or giant novae 20 the name supernovae is thought to have been coined by walter baade and zwicky in lectures at caltech during 1931 it was used as super novae in a journal paper published by knut lundmark in 1933 21 and in a 1934 paper by baade and zwicky 22 by 1938 the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use 23 american astronomers rudolph minkowski and fritz zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941 24 during the 1960s astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as standard candles hence indicators of astronomical distances 25 some of the most distant supernovae observed in 2003 appeared dimmer than expected this supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating 26 techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed the date of the cassiopeia a supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae 27 while the age of supernova remnant rx j0852 0 4622 was estimated from temperature measurements 28 and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium 44 29 sn antikythera in galaxy cluster rxc j0949 8 1707 sn eleanor and sn alexander were observed in the same galaxy in 2011 30 the most luminous supernova ever recorded is asassn 15lh at a distance of 3 82 gigalight years it was first detected in june 2015 and peaked at 570 billion l which is twice the bolometric luminosity of any other known supernova 31 however the nature of this supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested e g tidal disruption of a star by a black hole 32 among the earliest detected since time of detonation and for which the earliest spectra have been obtained beginning at 6 hours after the actual explosion is sn 2013fs which was recorded 3 hours after the supernova event on 6 october 2013 by the intermediate palomar transient factory iptf the star is located in a spiral galaxy named ngc 7610 160 million light years away in the constellation of pegasus 33 34 the supernova sn 2016gkg was detected by amateur astronomer victor buso from rosario argentina on 20 september 2016 35 36 it was the first time that the initial shock breakout from an optical supernova had been observed 35 the progenitor star has been identified in hubble space telescope images from before its collapse astronomer alex filippenko noted observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way 35 discovery programs edit supernova remnant snr e0519 69 0 in the large magellanic cloud because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy occurring about three times a century in the milky way 37 obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies today amateur and professional astronomers are finding several hundred every year some when near maximum brightness others on old astronomical photographs or plates supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy normally when they are discovered they are already in progress 38 to use supernovae as standard candles for measuring distance observation of their peak luminosity is required it is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum amateur astronomers who greatly outnumber professional astronomers have played an important role in finding supernovae typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs 39 toward the end of the 20th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer controlled telescopes and ccds for hunting supernovae while such systems are popular with amateurs there are also professional installations such as the katzman automatic imaging telescope 40 the supernova early warning system snews project uses a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the milky way galaxy 41 42 neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk 43 a star set to explode the sbw1 nebula surrounds a massive blue supergiant in the carina nebula supernova searches fall into two classes those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away because of the expansion of the universe the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its doppler shift or redshift on average more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby and so have a higher redshift thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z 0 1 0 3 44 where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum s frequency shift high redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves these are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions supernova spectroscopy used to study the physics and environments of supernovae is more practical at low than at high redshift 45 46 low redshift observations also anchor the low distance end of the hubble curve which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies 47 48 naming convention edit multi wavelength x ray infrared and optical compilation image of kepler s supernova remnant sn 1604supernova discoveries are reported to the international astronomical union s central bureau for astronomical telegrams which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova the name is formed from the prefix sn followed by the year of discovery suffixed with a one or two letter designation the first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from a to z afterward pairs of lower case letters are used aa ab and so on hence for example sn 2003c designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003 49 the last supernova of 2005 sn 2005nc was the 367th 14 26 3 367 since 2000 professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundred supernovae each year 572 in 2007 261 in 2008 390 in 2009 231 in 2013 50 51 historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred sn 185 sn 1006 sn 1054 sn 1572 called tycho s nova and sn 1604 kepler s star since 1885 the additional letter notation has been used even if there was only one supernova discovered that year e g sn 1885a sn 1907a etc this last happened with sn 1947a sn for supernova is a standard prefix until 1987 two letter designations were rarely needed since 1988 however they have been needed every year since 2016 the increasing number of discoveries has regularly led to the additional use of three digit designations 52 classification edit astronomers classify supernovae according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra if a supernova s spectrum contains lines of hydrogen known as the balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum it is classified type ii otherwise it is type i in each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve a graph of the supernova s apparent magnitude as a function of time 53 54 supernova taxonomy 53 54 type ino hydrogen type iapresents a singly ionised silicon si ii line at 615 0 nm nanometers near peak light thermal runaway type ib cweak or no silicon absorption feature type ibshows a non ionised helium he i line at 587 6 nm core collapse

its light curve linear in magnitude versus time 55 type iinsome narrow lines type iibspectrum changes to become like type ib type i edit light curve for type ia sn 2018gv type i supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra with type ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line type i supernovae without this strong line are classified as type ib and ic with type ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type ic lacking them the light curves are all similar although type ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity but the light curve is not important for classification of type i supernovae 54 a small number of type ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non standard luminosity or broadened light curves and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features for example the sub luminous sn 2008ha is often referred to as sn 2002cx like or class ia 2002cx 56 a small proportion of type ic supernovae show highly broadened and blended emission lines which are taken to indicate very high expansion velocities for the ejecta these have been classified as type ic bl or ic bl 57 calcium rich supernovae are a rare type of very fast supernova with unusually strong calcium lines in their spectra models suggest they occur when material is accreted from a helium rich companion rather than a hydrogen rich star because of helium lines in their spectra they can resemble type ib supernovae but are thought to have very different progenitors 58 type ii edit light curves are used to classify type ii p and type ii l supernovae artist s impression of supernova 1993j 59 the supernovae of type ii can also be sub divided based on their spectra while most type ii supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second some such as sn 2005gl have relatively narrow features in their spectra these are called type iin where the n stands for narrow 54 a few supernovae such as sn 1987k 60 and sn 1993j appear to change types they show lines of hydrogen at early times but over a period of weeks to months become dominated by lines of helium the term type iib is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with types ii and ib 54 type ii supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves the most common type shows a distinctive plateau in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes these are called type ii p referring to the plateau less common are type ii l supernovae that lack a distinct plateau the l signifies linear although the light curve is not actually a straight line 54 supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar or pec 54 types iii iv and v edit zwicky defined additional supernovae types based on a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for type i or type ii supernovae sn 1961i in ngc 4303 was the prototype and only member of the type iii supernova class noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum sn 1961f in ngc 3003 was the prototype and only member of the type iv class with a light curve similar to a type ii p supernova with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines the type v class was coined for sn 1961v in ngc 1058 an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness a maximum lasting many months and an unusual emission spectrum the similarity of sn 1961v to the eta carinae great outburst was noted 61 supernovae in m101 1909 and m83 1923 and 1957 were also suggested as possible type iv or type v supernovae 62 these types would now all be treated as peculiar type ii supernovae iipec of which many more examples have been discovered although it is still debated whether sn 1961v was a true supernova following an lbv outburst or an impostor 55 current models edit in the galaxy ngc 1365 a supernova the bright dot slightly above the galactic center rapidly brightens then fades more slowly 63 supernova type codes as summarised in the table above are taxonomic the type number is based on the light observed from the supernova not necessarily its cause for example type ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type ib c are produced from massive stripped progenitor stars by core collapse thermal runaway edit main article type ia supernova formation of a type ia supernova a white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting it there are three avenues by which this detonation is theorised to happen stable accretion of material from a companion the collision of two white dwarfs or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites the core the dominant mechanism by which type ia supernovae are produced remains unclear 64 despite this uncertainty in how type ia supernovae are produced type ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum 65 66 normal type ia edit there are several means by which a supernova of this type can form but they share a common underlying mechanism if a carbon oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the chandrasekhar limit of about 1 44 solar masses 67 for a non rotating star it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure 68 69 and would begin to collapse however the current view is that this limit is not normally attained increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit to within about 1 70 before collapse is initiated 67 in contrast for a core primarily composed of oxygen neon and magnesium the collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star in this case only a fraction of the star s mass will be ejected during the collapse 69 within a few seconds of the collapse process a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion releasing enough energy 1 2 1044 j 71 to unbind the star in a supernova 72 an outwardly expanding shock wave is generated with matter reaching velocities on the order of 5 000 20 000 km s or roughly 3 of the speed of light there is also a significant increase in luminosity reaching an absolute magnitude of 19 3 or 5 billion times brighter than the sun with little variation 73 the model for the formation of this category of supernova is a close binary star system the larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence and it expands to form a red giant the two stars now share a common envelope causing their mutual orbit to shrink the giant star then sheds most of its envelope losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion at this point it becomes a white dwarf star composed primarily of carbon and oxygen 74 eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf causing the latter to increase in mass the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event remain unclear type ia supernovae produce a characteristic light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the event this luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel 56 through cobalt 56 to iron 56 73 the peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal type ia supernovae having a maximum absolute magnitude of about 19 3 this is because typical type ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behaviour this allows them to be used as a secondary 75 standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies 76 alternative type ia edit a second model for the formation of type ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the chandrasekhar limit 77 this is sometimes referred to as the double degenerate model as both stars are degenerate white dwarfs due to the possible combinations of mass and chemical composition of the pair there is much variation in this type of event 78 and in many cases there may be no supernova at all in which case they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal sn type ia abnormally bright type ia supernovae occur when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the chandrasekhar limit 79 possibly enhanced further by asymmetry 80 but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy this super chandrasekhar mass scenario can occur for example when the extra mass is supported by differential rotation 81 there is no formal sub classification for non standard type ia supernovae it has been proposed that a group of sub luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type iax 82 83 this type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star 84 one specific type of supernova originates from exploding white dwarfs like type ia but contains hydrogen lines in their spectra possibly because the white dwarf is surrounded by an envelope of hydrogen rich circumstellar material these supernovae have been dubbed type ia iin type ian type iia and type iian 85 the quadruple star hd 74438 belonging to the open cluster ic 2391 the vela constellation has been predicted to become a non standard type ia supernova 86 87 core collapse edit the layers of a massive evolved star just before core collapse not to scale very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity passing this threshold is the cause of all types of supernova except type ia the collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova however if the release of gravitational potential energy is insufficient the star may instead collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms exceeding the chandrasekhar limit electron capture pair instability or photodisintegration 88 89 90 when a massive star develops an iron core larger than the chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate o ne mg core 8 10 solar mass progenitor star removes support and causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion with very similar results electron positron pair production in a large post helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion resulting in a pair instability supernova a sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly which will cause a complete collapse of the core the table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars the types of stars in which they occur their associated supernova type and the remnant produced the metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium as compared to the sun the initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event given in multiples of the sun s mass although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower type iin supernovae are not listed in the table they can be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars possibly even by type ia white dwarf ignitions although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants including lbvs the narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material 91 it appears that a significant proportion of supposed type iin supernovae are supernova impostors massive eruptions of lbv like stars similar to the great eruption of eta carinae in these events material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material 92 core collapse scenarios by mass and metallicity 89 cause of collapse progenitor star approximate initial mass solar

starts to collapse the inner part of the core is compressed into neutrons c causing infalling material to bounce d and form an outward propagating shock front red the shock starts to stall e but it is re invigorated by a process that may include neutrino interaction the surrounding material is blasted away f leaving only a degenerate remnant when a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching 70 000 km s 0 23c 93 resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density what follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes and non degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion the initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay photodisintegration and electron capture which causes a burst of electron neutrinos as the density increases neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core the inner core eventually reaches typically 30 km in diameter 94 with a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse if the core mass is more than about 15 solar masses then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova 88 in lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvin 6 000 times the temperature of the sun s core 95 at this temperature neutrino antineutrino pairs of all flavours are efficiently formed by thermal emission these thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron capture neutrinos 96 about 1046 joules approximately 10 of the star s rest mass is converted into a ten second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event 94 97 the suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls in the outer core within milliseconds 98 as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements a process that is not clearly understood update is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 1044 joules 97 1 foe from the neutrino pulse producing the visible brightness although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion 94 some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star and for cores beyond about 8 m there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole this fallback will reduce the kinetic energy created and the mass of expelled radioactive material but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova 99 the collapse of a massive non degenerate core will ignite further fusion when the core collapse is initiated by pair instability oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted for core masses of 40 60 m the collapse halts and the star remains intact but collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed for cores of around 60 130 m the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted causing a supernova at the upper end of the mass range the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long lived due to many solar masses of ejected 56ni for even larger core masses the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole 100 88 type ii edit main article type ii supernova the atypical subluminous type ii sn 1997d stars with initial masses less than about 8 m never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs stars with at least 9 m possibly as much as 12 m 101 evolve in a complex fashion progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores 94 102 the star becomes layered like an onion with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells 89 103 although popularly described as an onion with an iron core the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen neon magnesium cores these super agb stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors 101 if core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope the result is a type ii supernova 104 the rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a supernova of type ii 104 at low metallicity all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun or a little less at high metallicity result in a type ii p supernova which is the most commonly observed type at moderate to high metallicity stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type ii l supernova 105 at very low metallicity stars of around 140 250 m will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type ii characteristics but a very large mass of ejected 56ni and high luminosity type ib and ic edit main article type ib and ic supernovae sn 2008d a type ib 106 supernova at the far upper end of the galaxy shown in x ray left and visible light right 107 these supernovae like those of type ii are massive stars that undergo core collapse however the stars which become types ib and ic supernovae have lost most of their outer hydrogen envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion 108 these stars are known as wolf rayet stars and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates observations of type ib c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of wolf rayet stars alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed 109 since a supernova can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs type ib supernovae are the more common and result from wolf rayet stars of type wc which still have helium in their atmospheres for a narrow range of masses stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become wo stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type ic supernovae 110 a few percent of the type ic supernovae are associated with gamma ray bursts grb though it is also believed that any hydrogen stripped type ib or ic supernova could produce a grb depending on the circumstances of the geometry 111 the mechanism for producing this type of grb is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star the jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell producing a super luminous supernova 99 112 113 ultra stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped almost all the way to the metal core via mass transfer in a close binary 114 115 as a result very little material is ejected from the exploding star c 0 1 m in the most extreme cases ultra stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores barely above the chandrasekhar mass limit sn 2005ek 116 might be the first observational example of an ultra stripped supernova giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve the nature of ultra stripped supernovae can be both iron core collapse and electron capture supernovae depending on the mass of the collapsing core ultra stripped supernovae are believed to be associated with the second supernova explosion in a binary system e g producing a tight double neutron star system 117 118 in 2022 a team of astronomers led by researchers from the weizmann institute of science reported the first supernova explosion showing direct evidence for a wolf rayet progenitor star sn 2019hgp was a type icn supernova and is also the first in which the element neon has been detected 119 120 electron capture supernovae edit in 1980 a third type of supernova was predicted by ken ichi nomoto of the university of tokyo called an electron capture supernova it would arise when a star in the transitional range 8 to 10 solar masses between white dwarf formation and iron core collapse supernovae and with a degenerate o ne mg core 121 imploded after its core ran out of nuclear fuel causing gravity to compress the electrons in the star s core into their atomic nuclei 122 123 leading to a supernova explosion and leaving behind a neutron star 89 in june 2021 a paper in the journal nature astronomy reported that the 2018 supernova sn 2018zd in the galaxy ngc 2146 about 31 million light years from earth appeared to be the first observation of an electron capture supernova 121 122 123 the 1054 supernova explosion that created the crab nebula in our galaxy had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron capture supernova and the 2021 paper makes it more likely that this was correct 122 123 failed supernovae edit main article failed supernova the core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova this happens if the initial core collapse cannot be reversed by the mechanism that produces an explosion usually because the core is too massive these events are difficult to detect but large surveys have detected possible candidates 124 125 the red supergiant n6946 bh1 in ngc 6946 underwent a modest outburst in march 2009 before fading from view only a faint infrared source remains at the star s location 126 light curves edit comparative supernova type light curves a historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months the ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar as a source although the energy that initially powers each type of supernovae is delivered promptly the light curves are dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta the intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s and this has since been demonstrated as correct for most supernovae 127 it was not until sn 1987a that direct observation of gamma ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei 128 it is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the occurrence of a type ii supernova such as sn 1987a is explained by those predicted radioactive decays although the luminous emission consists of optical photons it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light the radioactive decay of 56ni through its daughters 56co to 56fe produces gamma ray photons primarily with energies of 847 kev and 1 238 kev that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times several weeks to late times several months 129 energy for the peak of the light curve of sn1987a was provided by the decay of 56ni to 56co half life 6 days while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77 3 day half life of 56co decaying to 56fe later measurements by space gamma ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56co and 57co gamma rays that escaped the sn 1987a remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources 128 messier 61 with supernova sn2020jfo taken by an amateur astronomer in 2020 the visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms the way that visible radiation is produced the epoch of its observation and the transparency of the ejected material 130 the light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths for example at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event but that breakout is hardly detectable optically the light curves for type ia are mostly very uniform with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of ejected nickel 56 half life 6 days which then decays to radioactive cobalt 56 half life 77 days these radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence 73 studies of cosmology today rely on 56ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of type ia which are the standard candles of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847 kev and 1 238 kev gamma rays were first detected only in 2014 131 the initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted the light curve continues to decline in the b band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it the visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt which has the longer half life and controls the later curve because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation after several months the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt 56 although this portion of the light curve has been little studied 132 type ib and ic light curves are basically similar to type ia although with a lower average peak luminosity the visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel 56 the peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type ib c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm the most luminous type ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity the source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole which also produce gamma ray bursts 133 134 the light curves for type ii supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type i on the order of 0 05 magnitudes per day 135 excluding the plateau phase the visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star in the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised the majority of type ii supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines emitting visible light and becoming more transparent this is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type i supernovae due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen 55 in type ii l the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output in type iib supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star that the light curve is closer to a type i supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks 55 type iin supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material their light curves are generally very broad and extended occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova these light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material this only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs 136 137 large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models

nebulosity asymmetry edit the pulsar in the crab nebula is travelling at 375 km s relative to the nebula 140 a long standing puzzle surrounding type ii supernovae is why the remaining compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre 141 pulsars and thus neutron stars are observed to have high peculiar velocities and black holes presumably do as well although they are far harder to observe in isolation the initial impetus can be substantial propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of 500 km s or greater this indicates an expansion asymmetry but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains update a puzzle proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation one possible explanation for this asymmetry is large scale convection above the core the convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse bounce and resulting expansion 142 another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star these jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova 143 144 a similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma ray bursts initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in type ia supernovae through observation this result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle however the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light 145 energy output edit the radioactive decays of nickel 56 and cobalt 56 that produce a supernova visible light curve although supernovae are primarily known as luminous events the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side effect particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event 146 there is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova in type ia white dwarf detonations most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta 147 in core collapse supernovae the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission and while some of this apparently powers the observed destruction 99 of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse standard type ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon oxygen white dwarf the details of the energetics are still not fully understood but the result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy around half a solar mass of that mass is 56ni generated from silicon burning 56ni is radioactive and decays into 56co by beta plus decay with a half life of six days and gamma rays 56co itself decays by the beta plus positron path with a half life of 77 days into stable 56fe these two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type ia supernovae in combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material they produce the rapidly declining light curve 148 core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type ia supernovae but the total energy released is far higher in these type of supernovae the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super heated neutron star core around 1 of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting catastrophe but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type ia supernovae hence the lower peak visual luminosity of type ii supernovae but energy from the de ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae energetics of supernovae supernova approximate total energyx1044 joules foe c ejected ni solar masses neutrino

rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material this is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type ic hypernovae and long duration gamma ray bursts if the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub luminous when a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation even though the initial energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay this type of event may cause type iin hypernovae although pair instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type ii p the nature after core collapse is more like that of a giant type ia with runaway fusion of carbon oxygen and silicon the total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high the cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher with consequently high visual luminosity progenitor edit occasional supernovae appear in this sped up artist s impression of distant galaxies each exploding star briefly rivals the brightness of its host galaxy the supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the collapse the occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy type ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary star systems and occur in all galaxy types core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation since they result from short lived massive stars they are most commonly found in type sc spirals but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies especially starburst galaxies type ib c and ii l and possibly most type iin supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies the table shows the progenitor for

evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae red supergiants are the progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities below about 18 m and 100 000 l respectively most progenitors of type ii supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter and presumably less massive this discrepancy has been referred to as the red supergiant problem it was first described in 2009 by stephen smartt who also coined the term after performing a volume limited search for supernovae smartt et al found the lower and upper mass limits for type ii p supernovae to form to be 8 5 1 1 5 m and 16 5 1 5 m respectively the former is consistent with the expected upper mass limits for white dwarf progenitors to form but the latter is not consistent with massive star populations in the local group 153 the upper limit for red supergiants that produce a visible supernova explosion has been calculated at 19 4 2 m 154 it is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures several progenitors of type iib supernovae have been confirmed and these were k and g supergiants plus one a supergiant 155 yellow hypergiants or lbvs are proposed progenitors for type iib supernovae and almost all type iib supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors 156 157 isolated neutron star in the small magellanic cloud until just a few decades ago hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode but observations have shown otherwise blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection while not a single wolf rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified 155 158 models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage one study has shown a possible route for low luminosity post red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse most likely as a type iin supernova 159 several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type iin supernovae have been detected sn 2005gy and sn 2010jl were both apparently massive luminous stars but are very distant and sn 2009ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an lbv but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disputed 155 the progenitors of type ib c supernovae are not observed at all and constraints on their possible luminosity are often lower than those of known wc stars 155 wo stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged 160 population modelling shows that the observed type ib c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped envelope stars from interacting binary systems 109 the continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal type ib and ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst most of these supernovae are then produced from lower mass low luminosity helium stars in binary systems a small number would be from rapidly rotating massive stars likely corresponding to the highly energetic type ic bl events that are associated with long duration gamma ray bursts 155 external impact edit supernovae events generate heavier elements that are scattered throughout the surrounding interstellar medium the expanding shock wave from a supernovae can trigger star formation galactic cosmic rays are generated by supernova explosions source of heavy elements edit main articles stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis periodic table showing the source of each element in the interstellar medium supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen through to rubidium 161 162 163 though the theoretical abundances of the elements produced or seen in the spectra varies significantly depending on the various supernova types 163 type ia supernovae produce mainly silicon and iron peak elements metals such as nickel and iron 164 165 core collapse supernovae eject much smaller quantities of the iron peak elements than type ia supernovae but larger masses of light alpha elements such as oxygen and neon and elements heavier than zinc the latter is especially true with electron capture supernovae 166 the bulk of the material ejected by type ii supernovae is hydrogen and helium 167 the heavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34s silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium during silicon burning for nuclei between 36ar and 56ni and rapid capture of neutrons r process during the supernova s collapse for elements heavier than iron the r process produces highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms in supernovae r process reactions are responsible for about half of all the isotopes of elements beyond iron 168 although neutron star mergers may be the main astrophysical source for many of these elements 161 169 in the modern universe old asymptotic giant branch agb stars are the dominant source of dust from s process elements oxides and carbon 161 170 however in the early universe before agb stars formed supernovae may have been the main source of dust 171 role in stellar evolution edit main article supernova remnant remnants of many supernovae consist of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material this cloud of material sweeps up surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase which can last for up to two centuries the wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10 000 years 172 supernova remnant n 63a lies within a clumpy region of gas and dust in the large magellanic cloud the big bang produced hydrogen helium and traces of lithium while all heavier elements are synthesised in stars and supernovae supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium which usually astronomers refer to as metals these injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation 173 thus each stellar generation has a slightly different composition going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal rich composition supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion the different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star s life and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it the kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby dense molecular clouds in space 174 the increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy 175 evidence from daughter products of short lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the solar system 4 5 billion years ago and may even have triggered the formation of this system 176 on 1 june 2020 astronomers reported narrowing down the source of fast radio bursts frbs which may now plausibly include compact object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core collapse supernovae 177 178 cosmic rays edit supernova remnants are thought to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays but direct evidence for cosmic ray production has only been found in a small number of remnants gamma rays from pion decay have been detected from the supernova remnants ic 443 and w44 these are produced when accelerated protons from the snr impact on interstellar material 179 gravitational waves edit supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves 180 but none have so far been detected the only gravitational wave events so far detected are from mergers of black holes and neutron stars probable remnants of supernovae 181 effect on earth edit main article near earth supernova a near earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere depending upon the type and energy of the supernova it could be as far as 3000 light years away in 1996 it was theorised that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata iron 60 enrichment was later reported in deep sea rock of the pacific ocean 182 183 184 in 2009 elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in antarctic ice which coincided with the 1006 and 1054 supernovae gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted atmospheric levels of nitrogen oxides which became trapped in the ice 185 type ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the earth because these supernovae arise from dim common white dwarf stars in binary systems it is likely that a supernova that can affect the earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied the closest known candidate is ik pegasi about 150 light years away 186 according to a 2003 estimate a type ii supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs 26 light years to destroy half of the earth s ozone layer and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years 187 milky way candidates edit main article list of supernova candidates the nebula around wolf rayet star wr124 which is located at a distance of about 21 000 light years 188 the next supernova in the milky way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy it is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as 2mass there is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant luminous blue variable or wolf rayet the chances of the next supernova being a type ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova again it should be observable wherever it occurs but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed it isn t even known exactly what a type ia progenitor system looks like and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs the total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be between 2 and 12 per century although we haven t actually observed one for several centuries 126 statistically the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left the most massive red supergiants shed their atmospheres and evolve to wolf rayet stars before their cores collapse all wolf rayet stars end their lives from the wolf rayet phase within a million years or so but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse one class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the wo wolf rayet stars which are known to have exhausted their core helium 189 only eight of them are known and only four of those are in the milky way 190 a number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates the red supergiants antares and betelgeuse 191 the yellow hypergiant rho cassiopeiae 192 the luminous blue variable eta carinae that has already produced a supernova impostor 193 and the brightest component a wolf rayet star in the regor or gamma velorum system 194 others have gained notoriety as possible although not very likely progenitors for a gamma ray burst for example wr 104 195 identification of candidates for a type ia supernova is much more speculative any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated these systems are faint and difficult to identify but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves one example is u scorpii 196 the nearest known type ia supernova candidate is ik pegasi hr 8210 located at a distance of 150 light years 197 but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a type ia supernova 198 see also edit

batman it was batman who first revealed to francine that kirk had mutated himself into the feral man bat at one point batman had captured the man bat and tried to give him an antidote to his condition but the man bat fought him at every turn he even tried bringing francine to the batcave in the hopes that she could convince langstrom to take the antidote willingly kirk escaped however and when he next reunited with francine forced her to take the same bat gland extract that he had taken as proof of her love and devotion to him although francine was terrified she knew that somewhere within the man bat s insanity lay the soul of the man she loved francine took the serum and like kirk mutated into a creature with bat like qualities the two man bats decided to marry one another at their wedding they donned latex masks to disguise their features but batman interrupted the ceremony and exposed them in front of all their guests batman fought against francine and kirk and was finally able to defeat them by using the cathedral s bells to incapacitate them upon doing so batman administered his cure to both of them turning them back to normal a few months later the langstroms traveled to las vegas nevada to study a rare breed of vampire bat that had surfaced following underground nuclear tests in new mexico while examining one of the bats francine pricked her finger on a fang and the toxin activated the dormant man bat gene that still resided in her body she transformed into a monster once again but this time with more vampiric characteristics including enhanced strength in this iteration francine could only transform into a she bat during the nights of the full moon an uncontrollable savage francine began terrorizing the streets of las vegas biting victims upon the neck and drinking their blood when news of her rampage reached gotham city batman believed that it was kirk langstrom who had become the man bat he flew out to vegas and fought the she bat on the roof of a vegas casino after the initial fight batman deduced that his opponent was not kirk langstrom at all but francine finding kirk the two tracked francine to a cave where batman ensnared her with his batrope he then administered the same antidote he had used in the past and francine was once again cured this treatment did not last long however a year later a professor of medieval history from antioke university known as baron tyme used his sorcery to take control of francine turning her back into the she bat he had francine attack and kill a former colleague of his named professor raymond arthur kirk langstrom became the man bat again and used hypnosis to break baron tyme s hold over her kirk defeated tyme and the sorcerer apparently died in his tower chamber when the room caught on fire batman consulted with langstrom about his wife s condition and insisted that he give francine a full blood transfusion kirk brought francine to his home town of chicago where she lived with him at the lakeshore manor apartments he kept a steady vigil over her condition and fortunately for them both the blood transfusion appeared to have cured her the langstroms had two children rebecca and aaron while rebecca was a normal human excluding the times when her whole family was mutated into man bats aaron was born a mutant bat creature due to the serum in his parents systems she also served as the lead scientist for the outsiders to help them with their missions in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe francine langstrom is reimagined as a more villainous character in this new timeline she met kirk as a research assistant and supposedly loved him for his conviction in developing the man bat serum for curing deafness when kirk transformed into the man bat to help cure the city of the man bat epidemic she decided to bring kirk back so he could perfect the formula for its original purpose then she would take the formula herself and transform into the she bat with some reported deaths kirk began to think that he lacked control over the beast but he discovered that francine s man bat formula differentiated from his as the bat she used was a south american vampire bat it is revealed that francine only married kirk to ensure the company that he would complete the serum and then have him killed so she could inherit a large sum of money she developed her own serum after kirk turned into the man bat in order to keep her job kirk tried to help cure her but she preferred her new form and attacked kirk but ultimately refused to kill him kirk combined the two serums in order to become a stronger beast and defeat francine and francine mocked him by acknowledging that he could only beat her by becoming like her she is later charged for the murders that she committed as the she bat 20 she is later released from arkham by the penguin and sent to attack harley quinn demonstrating that she has much better control over her transformation than kirk does she injects the man bat formula into harley and her friend tony to turn them into man bats however harley ultimately regains control over herself after francine threatens harley s friends and defeats the she bat 21 francine langstrom in other media edit francine langstrom appears in media set in the dc animated universe voiced by meredith macrae introduced in batman the animated series s first

from the lion s presence he battled hawkman but the first meteor wasn t pure the transformation would eventually kill him hawkman saved him by smashing the mithra stone and edward reverted to human hawkman theorized that the mithra meteor contains some radiation that transforms the one who touches it into lion mane who then represents an alien race who wants to terraform this planet days later dawson continues his criminal career as the lion mane when he found another mithra stone in a museum he didn t know that hawkman was his friend carter hall standing next to him edward again sensing that a lion is in captivity attacked nearby civilians hawkman tried to stop him but failed and was knocked out edward wanted to be a super powered human with this goal he sought other meteor pieces to increase his power and also to stay alive as lion mane with each meteor rock he touched his powers grew hawkman and hawkgirl managed to find him again and defeat him hawkman thought that he might still carry some pieces of the first meteor rock in his pockets and smashed them with a stone reverting edward back to human once more ed dawson later had a nightmare of him turning into lion mane

world in his image lion mane s powers were still growing he even affected people miles away and started to transform a selected few into lion men hawkgirl tried to fight him but her efforts were

introduced post zero hour a female scientist named karen ramis was transformed into lion mane a lion avatar by the mithra meteor she didn t want its power and that was how she was saved hawkman convinced her to fight the avatar and it left her seeking another host 29 although now back to her human form she still craved the meteor s power as it was more addictive than any other drug when hawkman was battling ed dawson karen used the only way to stop him as she again touched the mithra meteorite she was repowered but not quite lion mane as she had been transformed into a near lion like

luthor edit main article lena luthor lex luthor edit main article lex luthor lillian luthor edit lillian luthor was the mother of alexander luthor and julian luthor as well as the wife of lionel luthor smallville edit lillian portrayed by alisen down had a long and prolific role in the tv series smallville lillian came from a wealthy family how she met lionel is unclear but they were married sometime before the 1980s by all accounts lillian was a caring beautiful and sophisticated person as well as comments made by lex and lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality had ambitions of her own and often stood up to lionel eventually lillian began to wonder about the special projects that lionel had she searched for answers and found something called veritas however alexander saw her going through his father s briefcase so lillian asked him not to tell anyone when lionel found out he immediately blamed alexander and forced him to tell the truth when alexander did lillian insisted lionel explain what veritas was but lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again lillian felt angered and disgusted by alexander s betrayal sometime later lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life lionel hired a nurse named rachel dunleavy to assist her rachel and lionel subsequently had an affair resulting in the birth of lionel s illegitimate son lucas it is unclear whether lillian knew of the affair or the child lillian was helped by a nanny pamela jenkins who alexander regarded as a second mother lionel was often absent from home and lillian insisted that he take alexander on one of his business trips to smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 lionel s resulting shame and constant critique of alexander bothered lillian greatly sometime in the early 1990s lionel insisted that they have another child an idea that lillian was highly opposed to presumably because of her poor health however when alexander was 11 lillian became pregnant again she insisted that alexander be allowed to come home for school from excelsior academy and lionel complied her pregnancy was strenuous and lillian was bedridden for much of it on alexander s disastrous 12th birthday which no one attended lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of st george which he kept into adulthood and later gave to clark kent after baby julian s birth lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually one evening lionel sent the baby s nanny home and insisted that lillian bond with the child lillian expressed her concern that lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce a threat that she had apparently made many times and that lionel had called tiresome on returning home from work one night lionel discovered alexander in the baby s nursery alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing julian while trying to stop him from crying lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck alexander their relationship never recovered even after he became an adult it was not until years later after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories that he remembered that lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions hoping to spare him from lionel s maltreatment alexander took the blame correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife sometime before her death lillian along with lex and lionel went to a ranch in montana to spend time together during that time a snake spooked lillian s horse prompting lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better after julian s death lillian s health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when alexander was 13 he later confessed to clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her lex also told lana lang that he was away at boarding school when lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school lillian left her shares of luthorcorp to her son and pamela lillian s death was extremely influential in the adult lex s life he had visions of his mother on many occasions when lex was shot and ended up in a coma he had a near death experience in it lillian visited him and showed lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from lionel and luthorcorp however at the end of the vision lana his dream wife suffered complications during

a type of wolf estrogen taken from two alaskan timber wolves the steroids allowed him to win the gold medal but he would eventually become a werewolf milo used the promise of a cure to blackmail

because she has accepted the reality that any true relationship with a man who literally took the responsibility of the world on his shoulders is all but impossible thus lana is struck hard by the

secret behind at one of her ghostly appearances giving him tangible proof of her survival and two deep down she still loves vartox and finds herself unable to deny him happiness syreena restores lana at a terrible cost the effect can not be dispelled only transferred dooming syreena to life as a stone statue however vartox and lana are forced to part once again the effect that would have let her

and future husband percy b shelley in 1816 mary percy and lord byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story 5 after thinking for days shelley was inspired to write frankenstein after imagining a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made 6 though frankenstein is infused with elements of the gothic novel and the romantic movement brian aldiss has argued for regarding it as the first true science fiction story in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction aldiss states the central character makes a deliberate decision and turns to modern experiments in the laboratory to achieve fantastic results 7 the novel has had a considerable influence on literature and on popular culture it has spawned a complete genre of horror stories films and plays since the publication of the novel the name frankenstein has often been used erroneously to refer to the monster rather than to his creator father 8 9

and his sister margaret walton saville the story takes place in the eighteenth century the letters are dated as 17 robert walton is a failed writer who sets out to explore the north pole in hopes of expanding scientific knowledge during the voyage the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure a few hours later the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named victor frankenstein frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by walton s crew frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion he sees in walton the same obsession that has destroyed him and recounts a story of his life s miseries to walton as a warning the recounted story serves as the frame for frankenstein s narrative victor frankenstein s narrative edit victor begins by telling of his childhood born in naples italy into a wealthy genevan family victor and his younger brothers ernest and william are sons of alphonse frankenstein and the former caroline beaufort from a young age victor has a strong desire to understand the world he is obsessed with studying theories of alchemists though when he is older he realizes that such theories are considerably outdated when victor is five years old his parents adopt elizabeth lavenza the orphaned daughter of an expropriated italian nobleman whom victor later marries victor s parents later take in another child justine moritz who becomes william s nanny weeks before he leaves for the university of ingolstadt in germany his mother dies of scarlet fever victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief at the university he excels at chemistry and other sciences soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non living matter he undertakes the creation of a humanoid but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body victor makes the creature tall about 8 feet 2 4 m in height and proportionally large despite victor s selecting its features to be beautiful upon animation the creature is instead hideous with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath repulsed by his work victor flees while wandering the streets the next day he meets his childhood friend henry clerval and takes clerval back to his apartment fearful of clerval s reaction if he sees the monster however when victor returns to his laboratory the creature is gone victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by clerval after a four month recovery he receives a letter from his father notifying him of the murder of his brother william upon arriving in geneva victor sees the creature near the crime scene and becomes convinced that his creation is responsible justine moritz william s nanny is convicted of the crime after william s locket which contained a miniature portrait of caroline is found in her pocket victor knows that no one will believe him if he tries to clear justine s name and she is hanged ravaged by grief and guilt victor retreats into the mountains while he hikes through mont blanc s mer de glace he is suddenly approached by the creature who pleads for victor to hear his tale the creature s narrative edit intelligent and articulate the creature relates his first days of life living alone in the wilderness he found that people were afraid of him and hated him due to his appearance which led him to fear and hide from them while living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage he grew fond of the poor family living there and discreetly collected firewood for them cleared snow away from their path and performed other tasks to help them secretly living next to the cottage for months the creature learned to speak by listening to them and taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods when he saw his reflection in a pool he realized his appearance was hideous and it horrified him as much as it horrified normal humans as he continued to learn of the family s plight he grew increasingly attached to them and eventually he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend entering the house while only the blind father was present the two conversed but on the return of the others the rest of them were frightened the blind man s son attacked him and the creature fled the house the next day the family left their home out of fear that he would return the creature was enraged by the way he was treated and gave up hope of ever being accepted by humans although he hated his creator for abandoning him he decided to travel to geneva to find him because he believed that victor was the only person with a responsibility to help him on the journey he rescued a child who had fallen into a river but her father believing that the creature intended to harm them shot him in the shoulder the creature then swore revenge against all humans he travelled to geneva using details from victor s journal murdered william and framed justine for the crime the creature demands that victor create a female companion like himself he argues that as a living being he has a right to happiness the creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the south american wilderness never to reappear if victor grants his request should victor refuse the creature threatens to kill victor s remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him fearing for his family victor reluctantly agrees the creature says he will watch over victor s progress victor frankenstein s narrative resumes edit clerval accompanies victor to england but they separate at victor s insistence at perth scotland victor suspects that the creature is following him working on the female creature on orkney he is plagued by premonitions of disaster he fears that the female will hate the creature or become more evil than he is even more worrying to him is the idea that creating the second creature might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague humankind he tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the creature who had indeed followed victor watching through a window the creature immediately bursts through the door to confront victor and tries to threaten him into working again but victor is convinced that since the creature is evil his mate would be evil as well and that the pair would threaten all of humanity by giving rise to a new race just like them the creature leaves but gives a final threat i will be with you on your wedding night victor interprets this as a threat upon his life believing that the creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy victor sails out to sea to dispose of his instruments falls asleep in the boat is unable to return to shore because of changes in the winds and ends up being blown to the irish coast when victor lands in ireland he is arrested for clerval s murder as the creature had strangled clerval and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived victor suffers another mental breakdown and wakes to find himself in prison however he is shown to be innocent and after being released he returns home with his father who has restored to elizabeth some of her father s fortune in geneva victor is about to marry elizabeth and prepares to fight the creature to the death arming himself with pistols and a dagger the night following their wedding victor asks elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for the fiend while victor searches the house and grounds the creature strangles elizabeth from the window victor sees the creature who tauntingly points at elizabeth s corpse victor tries to shoot him but the creature escapes victor s father weakened by age and by the death of elizabeth dies a few days later seeking revenge victor pursues the creature through europe then north into russia with his adversary staying ahead of him every step of the way eventually the chase leads to the arctic ocean and then on towards the north pole and victor reaches a point where he is within a mile of the creature but he collapses from exhaustion and hypothermia before he can find his quarry allowing the creature to escape eventually the ice around victor s sledge breaks apart and the resultant ice floe comes within range of walton s ship captain walton s conclusion edit at the end of victor s narrative captain walton resumes telling the story a few days after the creature vanishes the ship becomes trapped in pack ice and several crewmen die in the cold before the rest of walton s crew insists on returning south once it is freed upon hearing the crew s demands victor is angered and despite his condition gives a powerful speech to them he reminds them of why they chose to join the expedition and that it is hardship and danger not comfort that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs he urges them to be men not cowards however although the speech makes an impression on the crew it is not enough to change their minds and when the ship is freed walton regretfully decides to return south victor even though he is in a very weak condition states that he will go on by himself he is adamant that the creature must die victor dies shortly thereafter telling walton in his last words to seek happiness in tranquility and avoid ambition walton discovers the creature on his ship mourning over victor s body the creature tells walton that victor s death has not brought him peace rather his crimes have made him even more miserable than victor ever was the creature vows to kill himself so that no one else will ever know of his existence and walton watches as the creature drifts away on an ice raft never to be seen again author s background edit mary shelley by richard rothwell 1840 41 mary shelley s mother mary wollstonecraft died from infection eleven days after giving birth to her shelley grew close to her father william godwin having never known her mother godwin hired a nurse who briefly cared for her and her half sister before marrying second wife mary jane clairmont who did not like the close bond between shelley and her father the resulting friction caused godwin to favour his other children shelley s father was a famous author of the time and her education was of great importance to him although it was not formal shelley grew up surrounded by her father s friends writers and persons of political importance who often gathered at the family home this inspired her authorship at an early age mary met percy bysshe shelley who later became her husband at the age of sixteen while he was visiting her father godwin did not approve of the relationship between his daughter and an older married man so they fled to france along with her stepsister claire clairmont it was during their trip to france that percy very likely had an affair with mary s stepsister claire 11 on 22 february 1815 shelley gave birth prematurely to her first child clara who then died two weeks later over eight years she endured a similar pattern of pregnancy and loss one haemorrhage occurring until percy placed her upon ice to cease the bleeding 12 in the summer of 1816 mary percy and claire took a trip to visit claire s lover lord byron in geneva during the visit byron suggested that he mary percy and byron s physician john polidori have a competition to write the best ghost story to pass time stuck indoors 13 historians suggest that an affair occurred too even that the father of one of shelley s children may have been byron 12 mary was just eighteen years old when she won the contest with her creation of frankenstein 14 15 literary influences edit shelley s work was heavily influenced by that of her parents her father was famous for enquiry concerning political justice and her mother famous for a vindication of the rights of woman her father s novels also influenced her writing of frankenstein these novels included things as they are or the adventures of caleb williams st leon and fleetwood all of these books were set in switzerland similar to the setting in frankenstein some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in shelley s novel stem from these works she had in her possession other literary influences that appear in frankenstein are pygmalion et galatée by mme de genlis and ovid with the use of individuals identifying the problems with society 16 ovid also inspires the use of prometheus in shelley s title 17 the influence of john milton s paradise lost and samuel taylor coleridge s the rime of the ancient mariner are clearly evident in the novel in the frankenstein of the french revolution author julia douthwaite posits that shelley likely acquired some ideas for frankenstein s character from humphry davy s book elements of chemical philosophy in which he had written that science has bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him references to the french revolution run through the novel a possible source may lie in françois félix nogaret fr s le miroir des événemens actuels ou la belle au plus offrant 1790 a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named frankésteïn who creates a life sized automaton 18 both frankenstein and the monster quote passages from percy shelley s 1816 poem mutability and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose percy shelley s name never appeared as the author of the poem although the novel credits other quoted poets by name samuel taylor coleridge s poem the rime of the ancient mariner 1798 is associated with the theme of guilt and william wordsworth s tintern abbey 1798 with that of innocence many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers now called physical scientists with shelley s work because of several notable similarities two of the most noted natural philosophers among shelley s contemporaries were giovanni aldini who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio electric galvanism in london 19 and johann konrad dippel who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans while shelley was aware of both of these men and their activities she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes ideas about life and death discussed by percy and byron were of great interest to scientists of that time they discussed ideas from erasmus darwin and the experiments of luigi galvani as well as james lind 20 mary joined these conversations and the ideas of darwin galvani and perhaps lind were present in her novel shelley s personal experiences also influenced the themes within frankenstein the themes of loss guilt and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from mary shelley s own life the loss of her mother the relationship with her father and the death of her first child are thought to have inspired the monster and his separation from parental guidance in a 1965 issue of the journal of religion and health a psychologist proposed that the theme of guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for percy because of the loss of their child 15 composition edit draft of frankenstein it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld my man completed during the rainy summer of 1816 the year without a summer the world was locked in a long cold volcanic winter caused by the eruption of mount tambora in 1815 21 22 mary shelley aged 18 and her lover and future husband percy bysshe shelley visited lord byron at the villa diodati by lake geneva in switzerland the weather was too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned so the group retired indoors until dawn sitting around a log fire at byron s villa the company amused themselves by reading german ghost stories translated into french from the book fantasmagoriana 23 byron proposed that they each write a ghost story 24 unable to think of a story mary shelley became anxious she recalled being asked have you thought of a story each morning and every time being forced to reply with a mortifying negative 25 during one evening in the middle of summer the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life perhaps a corpse would be re animated mary noted galvanism had given token of such things 26 it was after midnight before they retired and unable to sleep she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the grim terrors of her waking dream 6 i saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together i saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out and then on the working of some powerful engine show signs of life and stir with an uneasy half vital motion frightful must it be for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator of the world 27 in september 2011 astronomer donald olson after a visit to the lake geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars concluded that her waking dream took place between 2 a m and 3 a m on 16 june 1816 several days after the initial idea by lord byron that they each write a ghost story 28 mary shelley began writing what she assumed would be a short story but with percy shelley s encouragement she expanded the tale into a full fledged novel 29 she later described that summer in switzerland as the moment when i first stepped out from childhood into life 30 shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half sister fanny 31 this was one of many personal tragedies that impacted shelley s work shelley s first child died in infancy and when she began composing frankenstein in 1816 she was likely nursing her second child who was also dead by the time of frankenstein s publication 32 shelley wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of bath in 1816 33 byron managed to write just a fragment based on the vampire legends he heard while travelling the balkans and from this john polidori created the vampyre 1819 the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave the group talked about enlightenment and counter enlightenment ideas as well mary shelley believed the enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly however she also believed the romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society 34 shelley s manuscripts for the first three volume edition in 1818 written 1816 1817 as well as the fair copy for her publisher are now housed in the bodleian library in oxford the bodleian acquired the papers in 2004 and they belong now to the abinger collection 35 36 in 2008 the bodleian published a new edition of frankenstein edited by charles e robinson that contains comparisons of mary shelley s original text with percy shelley s additions and interventions alongside 37 frankenstein and the monster edit the creature edit main article frankenstein s monster an english editorial cartoonist conceives the irish fenian movement as akin to frankenstein s creature in the wake of the phoenix park murders in an 1882 issue of punch 38 although the creature was described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and reanimated by the use of electricity this description is not consistent with shelley s work both the use of electricity and the cobbled together image of frankenstein s monster were more the result of james whale s popular 1931 film adaptation of the story and other early motion picture works based on the creature in shelley s original work victor frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter though the exact nature of the process is left ambiguous after a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature s body one anatomical feature at a time from raw materials supplied by the dissecting room and the slaughter house which he then brings to life using his unspecified process part of frankenstein s rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give him a name instead frankenstein s creation is referred to by words such as wretch monster creature demon devil fiend and it when frankenstein converses with the creature he addresses him as vile insect abhorred monster fiend wretched devil and abhorred devil john c engleworth a victorian literature professor at cornell university 36 posits that the creature was inspired by a man shelley met in her time in geneva with lord byron the man was a beggar and geometer by the name of noah burdick whom shelley described in her travel diary as sickly gaunt abysmally tall and lacking any human emotion morality or sensibilities 35 jackson blackwell a literary historian corroborates this viewpoint 39 in the novel the creature is compared to adam 39 the first man in the garden of eden the monster also compares himself with the fallen angel speaking to frankenstein the monster says i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel that angel would be lucifer meaning light bringer in milton s paradise lost which the monster has read adam is also referred to in the epigraph of the 1818 edition 40 did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me 41 the creature has often been mistakenly called frankenstein in 1908 one author said it is strange to note how well nigh universally the term frankenstein is misused even by intelligent people as describing some hideous monster 42 edith wharton s the reef 1916 describes an unruly child as an infant frankenstein 43 david lindsay s the bridal ornament published in the rover 12 june 1844 mentioned the maker of poor frankenstein after the release of whale s cinematic frankenstein the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as frankenstein this misnomer continued with the successful sequel bride of frankenstein 1935 as well as in film titles such as abbott and costello meet frankenstein illustration by theodor von holst from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition 44 origin of victor frankenstein s name edit mary shelley maintained that she derived the name frankenstein from a dream vision this claim has since been disputed and debated by scholars that have suggested alternative sources for shelley s inspiration 45 the german name frankenstein means stone of the franks and is associated with various places in germany including frankenstein castle burg frankenstein in darmstadt hesse and frankenstein castle in frankenstein a town in the palatinate there is also a castle called frankenstein in bad salzungen thuringia and a municipality called frankenstein in saxony until 1945 ząbkowice śląskie now a city in lower silesian voivodeship poland was mainly populated by germans and was the site of a scandal involving gravediggers in 1606 which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author 46 finally the name is borne by the aristocratic house of franckenstein from franconia radu florescu argued that mary and percy shelley visited frankenstein castle near darmstadt in 1814 where alchemist johann konrad dippel had experimented with human bodies and reasoned that mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality 47 a literary essay by a j day supports florescu s position that mary shelley knew of and visited frankenstein castle before writing her debut novel 48 day includes details of an alleged description of the frankenstein castle in mary shelley s lost journals however according to jörg heléne day s and florescu s claims cannot be verified 49 a possible interpretation of the name victor is derived from paradise lost by john milton a great influence on shelley a quotation from paradise lost is on the opening page of frankenstein and shelley writes that the monster reads it in the novel 50 51 milton frequently refers to god as the victor in paradise lost and victor s creation of life in the novel is compared to god s creation of life in paradise lost in addition shelley s portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of satan in paradise lost and the monster says in the story after reading the epic poem that he empathizes with satan s role parallels between victor frankenstein and mary s husband percy shelley have also been drawn percy shelley was the first born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of sir bysshe shelley 1st baronet of castle goring and richard fitzalan 10th earl of arundel 52 similarly victor s family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counsellors and syndics percy s sister and victor s adopted sister were both named elizabeth there are many other similarities from percy s usage of victor as a pen name for original poetry by victor and cazire a collection of poetry he wrote with elizabeth 53 to percy s days at eton where he had experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions and the way in which percy s rooms at oxford were filled with scientific equipment 54 55 modern prometheus edit the modern prometheus is the novel s subtitle though modern editions now drop it only mentioning it in introduction 56 prometheus in versions of greek mythology was the titan who created humans in the image of the gods so that they could have a spirit breathed into them at the behest of zeus 57 prometheus then taught humans to hunt but after he tricked zeus into accepting poor quality offerings from humans zeus kept fire from humankind prometheus took back the fire from zeus to give to humanity when zeus discovered this he sentenced prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of caucasus where each day an eagle pecked out his liver only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god as a pythagorean or believer in an essay on abstinence from animal food as a moral duty by joseph ritson 58 mary shelley saw prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil and blamed him for bringing fire to humanity and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat 59 percy wrote several essays on what became known as vegetarianism including a vindication of natural diet 58 in 1910 edison studios released the first motion picture adaptation of shelley s story byron was particularly attached to the play prometheus bound by aeschylus and percy shelley soon wrote his own prometheus unbound 1820 the term modern prometheus was derived from immanuel kant who described benjamin franklin as the prometheus of modern times in reference to his experiments with electricity 60 publication edit shelley completed her writing in april may 1817 and frankenstein or the modern prometheus was published on 1 january 1818 61 by the small london publishing house lackington hughes harding mavor jones 62 63 it was issued anonymously with a preface written for mary by percy bysshe shelley and with a dedication to philosopher william godwin her father it was published in an edition of just 500 copies in three volumes the standard triple decker format for 19th century first editions a variety of different editions a french translation frankenstein ou le prométhée moderne translated by jules saladin appeared as early as 1821 the second english edition of frankenstein was published on 11 august 1823 in two volumes by g and w b whittaker following the success of the stage play presumption or the fate of frankenstein by richard brinsley peake 64 this edition credited mary shelley as the book s author on its title page on 31 october 1831 the first popular edition in one volume appeared published by henry colburn richard bentley 65 this edition was heavily revised by mary shelley partially to make the story less radical it included a lengthy new preface by the author presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story this edition is the one most widely published and read now although a few editions follow the 1818 text 66 some scholars prefer the original version arguing that it preserves the spirit of mary shelley s vision see anne k mellor s choosing a text of frankenstein to teach in the w w norton critical edition reception edit frankenstein has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818 critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author walter scott writing in blackwood s edinburgh magazine praises the novel as an extraordinary tale in which the author seems to us to disclose uncommon powers of poetic imagination although he was less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language 67 la belle assemblée described the novel as very bold fiction 68 and the edinburgh magazine and literary miscellany hoped to see more productions from this author 69 on the other hand john wilson croker writing anonymously in the quarterly review although conceding that the author has powers both of conception and language described the book as a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity 70 in two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of william godwin the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of mary shelley the british critic attacks the novel s flaws as the fault of the author the writer of it is we understand a female this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex it is no reason why we should and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment 71 the literary panorama and national register attacks the novel as a feeble imitation of mr godwin s novels produced by the daughter of a celebrated living novelist 72 despite these reviews frankenstein achieved an almost immediate popular success it became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations mary shelley saw a production of presumption or the fate of frankenstein a play by richard brinsley peake in 1823 critical reception of frankenstein has been largely positive since the mid 20th century 73 major critics such as m a goldberg and harold bloom have praised the aesthetic and moral relevance of the novel 74 although there have also been critics such as germaine greer who criticized the novel for technical and narrative defects who claimed it has three narrators who speak in the same way 75 in more recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism lawrence lipking states e ven the lacanian subgroup of psychoanalytic criticism for instance has produced at least half a dozen discrete readings of the novel 76 frankenstein has frequently been recommended on five books with literary scholars psychologists novelists and historians citing it as an influential text 77 today the novel is generally considered to be a landmark work as one of the greatest romantic and gothic novels as well as one of the first science fiction novels 78 film director guillermo del toro describes frankenstein as the quintessential teenage book noting that the feelings that you don t belong you were brought to this world by people that don t care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering and tears and hunger are an important part of the story he adds that it s an amazing book written by a teenage girl it s mind blowing 79 professor of philosophy patricia maccormack says that the creature addresses the most fundamental human questions it s the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is why are we here what can we do 79 on 5 november 2019 bbc news listed frankenstein on its list of the 100 most influential novels 80 in 2021 it was one of six

greater than that of a proton protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit they are both referred to as nucleons 7 their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics protons and neutrons are not elementary particles each is composed of three quarks the chemical properties of an atom are mostly determined by the configuration of electrons that orbit the atom s heavy nucleus the electron configuration is determined by the charge of the nucleus which is determined by the number of protons or atomic number the number of neutrons is the neutron number neutrons do not affect the electron configuration but the sum of atomic and neutron numbers is the mass of the nucleus atoms of a chemical element that differ only in neutron number are called isotopes for example carbon with atomic number 6 has an abundant isotope carbon 12 with 6 neutrons and a rare isotope carbon 13 with 7 neutrons some elements occur in nature with only one stable isotope such as fluorine other elements occur with many stable isotopes such as tin with ten stable isotopes and some elements such as technetium have no stable isotope the properties of an atomic nucleus depend on both atomic and neutron numbers with their positive charge the protons within the nucleus are repelled by the long range electromagnetic force but the much stronger but short range nuclear force binds the nucleons closely together neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei with the exception of the single proton hydrogen nucleus neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear fission and fusion they are a primary contributor to the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements within stars through fission fusion and neutron capture processes the neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power in the decade after the neutron was discovered by james chadwick in 1932 8 neutrons were used to induce many different types of nuclear transmutations with the discovery of nuclear fission in 1938 9 it was quickly realized that if a fission event produced neutrons each of these neutrons might cause further fission events in a cascade known as a nuclear chain reaction 10 these events and findings led to the first self sustaining nuclear reactor chicago pile 1 1942 and the first nuclear weapon trinity 1945 dedicated neutron sources like neutron generators research reactors and spallation sources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in neutron scattering experiments a free neutron spontaneously decays to a proton an electron and an antineutrino with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes 11 free neutrons do not directly ionize atoms but they do indirectly cause ionizing radiation so they can be a biological hazard depending on dose 10 a small natural neutron background flux of free neutrons exists on earth caused by cosmic ray showers and by the natural radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable elements in the earth s crust 12 contents 1 description 2 discovery 3 beta decay and the stability of the nucleus 3 1 free neutron decay 3 2

of neutrons n the neutron number bound together by the nuclear force the atomic number determines the chemical properties of the atom and the neutron number determines the isotope or nuclide 10 the terms isotope and nuclide are often used synonymously but they refer to chemical and nuclear properties respectively isotopes are nuclides with the same atomic number but different neutron number nuclides with the same neutron number but different atomic number are called isotones the atomic mass number a is equal to the sum of atomic and neutron numbers nuclides with the same atomic mass number but different atomic and neutron numbers are called isobars the nucleus of the most common isotope of the hydrogen atom with the chemical symbol 1h is a lone proton the nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium d or 2h and tritium t or 3h contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons respectively all other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons the most common nuclide of the common chemical element lead 208pb has 82 protons and 126 neutrons for example the table of nuclides comprises all the known nuclides even though it is not a chemical element the neutron is included in this table 13 the free neutron has a mass of 939565413 3 ev c2 or 1 674927471 10 27 kg or 1 00866491588 da 4 the neutron has a mean square radius of about 0 8 10 15 m or 0 8 fm 14 and it is a spin ½ fermion 15 the neutron has no measurable electric charge with its positive electric charge the proton is directly influenced by electric fields whereas the neutron is unaffected by electric fields but the neutron has a magnetic moment so the neutron is influenced by magnetic fields the neutron s magnetic moment has a negative value because its orientation is opposite to the neutron s spin 16 a free neutron is unstable decaying to a proton electron and antineutrino with a mean lifetime of just under 15 minutes 879 6 0 8 s 5 this radioactive decay known as beta decay is possible because the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than that of the proton the free proton is stable however neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable depending on the nuclide beta decay in which neutrons decay to protons or vice versa is governed by the weak force and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos or their antiparticles nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium 235 the heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons protons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus the concept of isospin in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances the binding energy of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms nuclear reactions such as nuclear fission therefore have an energy density that is more than ten million times that of chemical reactions because of the mass energy equivalence nuclear binding energies reduce the mass of nuclei ultimately the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible in nuclear fission the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide e g uranium 235 causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons the positively charged light nuclides then repel releasing electromagnetic potential energy the neutron is classified as a hadron because it is a composite particle made of quarks the neutron is also classified as a baryon because it is composed of three valence quarks 17 the finite size of the neutron and its magnetic moment both indicate that the neutron is a composite rather than elementary particle a neutron contains two down quarks with charge 1 3e and one up quark with charge 2 3e like protons the quarks of the neutron are held together by the strong force mediated by gluons 18 the nuclear force results from secondary effects of the more fundamental strong force discovery edit main article discovery of the neutron the story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century leading ultimately to the atomic bomb in 1945 in the 1911 rutherford model the atom consisted of a small positively charged massive nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons in 1920 ernest rutherford suggested that the nucleus consisted of positive protons and neutrally charged particles suggested to be a proton and an electron bound in some way 19 electrons were assumed to reside within the nucleus because it was known that beta radiation consisted of electrons emitted from the nucleus 19 about the time rutherford suggested the neutral proton electron composite several other publications appeared making similar suggestions and in 1921 the american chemist w d harkins first named the hypothetical particle a neutron 20 21 the name derives from the latin root for neutralis neuter and the greek suffix on a suffix used in the names of subatomic particles i e electron and proton 22 23 references to the word neutron in connection with the atom can be found in the literature as early as 1899 however 21 throughout the 1920s physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was composed of protons and nuclear electrons 24 25 but there were obvious problems it was difficult to reconcile the proton electron model for nuclei with the heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics 26 27 the klein paradox 28 discovered by oskar klein in 1928 presented further quantum mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within a nucleus 26 observed properties of atoms and molecules were inconsistent with the nuclear spin expected from the proton electron hypothesis both protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of 1 2ħ isotopes of the same species i e having the same number of protons can have both integer or fractional spin i e the neutron spin must be also fractional 1 2ħ but there is no way to arrange the spins of an electron and a proton supposed to bond to form a neutron to get the fractional spin of a neutron in 1931 walther bothe and herbert becker found that if alpha particle radiation from polonium fell on beryllium boron or lithium an unusually penetrating radiation was produced the radiation was not influenced by an electric field so bothe and becker assumed it was gamma radiation 29 30 the following year irène joliot curie and frédéric joliot curie in paris showed that if this gamma radiation fell on paraffin or any other hydrogen containing compound it ejected protons of very high energy 31 neither rutherford nor james chadwick at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge were convinced by the gamma ray interpretation 32 chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments that showed that the new radiation consisted of uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton 8 33 34 these particles were neutrons chadwick won the 1935 nobel prize in physics for this discovery 2 models depicting the nucleus and electron energy levels in hydrogen helium lithium and neon atoms in reality the diameter of the nucleus is about 100 000 times smaller than the diameter of the atom models for an atomic nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by werner heisenberg 35 36 37 and others 38 39 the proton neutron model explained the puzzle of nuclear spins the origins of beta radiation were explained by enrico fermi in 1934 by the process of beta decay in which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a at the time undiscovered neutrino 40 in 1935 chadwick and his doctoral student maurice goldhaber reported the first accurate measurement of the mass of the neutron 41 42 by 1934 fermi had bombarded heavier elements with neutrons to induce radioactivity in elements of high atomic number in 1938 fermi received the nobel prize in physics for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons 43 in 1938 otto hahn lise meitner and fritz strassmann discovered nuclear fission or the fractionation of uranium nuclei into light elements induced by neutron bombardment 44 45 46 in 1945 hahn received the 1944 nobel prize in chemistry for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei 47 48 49 the discovery of nuclear fission would lead to the development of nuclear power and the atomic bomb by the end of world war ii beta decay and the stability of the nucleus edit see also valley of stability beta decay stable isobars and neutron emission since interacting protons have a mutual electromagnetic repulsion that is stronger than their attractive nuclear interaction neutrons are a necessary constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one proton see diproton and neutron proton ratio 50 neutrons bind with protons and one another in the nucleus via the nuclear force effectively moderating the repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the nucleus the neutrons and protons bound in a nucleus form a quantum mechanical system wherein each nucleon is bound in a particular hierarchical quantum state protons can decay to neutrons or vice versa within the nucleus this process called beta decay requires the emission of an electron or positron and an associated neutrino these emitted particles carry away the energy excess as a nucleon falls from one quantum state to a lower energy state while the proton or neutron changes to a neutron or proton such decay processes can occur only if allowed by basic energy conservation and quantum mechanical constraints the stability of nuclei depends on these constraints free neutron decay edit main article free neutron decay outside the nucleus free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 879 6 0 8 s about 14 minutes 40 seconds therefore the half life for this process which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ln 2 0 693 is 610 1 0 7 s about 10 minutes 10 seconds 11 51 this decay is only possible because the mass of the proton is less than that of the neutron by the mass energy equivalence when a neutron decays to a proton this way it attains a lower energy state beta decay of the neutron described above can be denoted by the radioactive decay 52 n0 p e νe where p e and νe denote the proton electron and electron antineutrino respectively for the free neutron the decay energy for this process based on the masses of the neutron proton and electron is 0 782343 mev the maximal energy of the beta decay electron in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy has been measured at 0 782 0 013 mev 53 the latter number is not well enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the neutrino which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy as well as neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods a small fraction about one in 1000 of free neutrons decay with the same products but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray n0 p e νe γ this gamma ray may be thought of as an internal bremsstrahlung that arises from the electromagnetic interaction of the emitted beta particle with the proton internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons as discussed below a schematic of the nucleus of an atom indicating β radiation the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus the accompanying antineutrino is omitted in the rutherford model for the nucleus red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge the inset shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today an electron and antineutrino are created in this process a very small minority of neutron decays about four per million are so called two body neutron decays in which a proton electron and antineutrino are produced as usual but the electron fails to gain the 13 6 ev necessary energy to escape the proton the ionization energy of hydrogen and therefore simply remains bound to it as a neutral hydrogen atom one of the two bodies in this type of free neutron decay almost all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino the other body the hydrogen atom recoils with a speed of only about decay energy hydrogen rest energy times the speed of light or 250 km s the transformation of a free proton to a neutron plus a positron and a neutrino is energetically impossible since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton but a high energy collision of a proton and an electron or neutrino can result in a neutron bound neutron decay edit main article atomic nucleus while a free neutron has a half life of about 10 2 min most neutrons within nuclei are stable according to the nuclear shell model the protons and neutrons of a nuclide are a quantum mechanical system organized into discrete energy levels with unique quantum numbers for a neutron to decay the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state in stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled meaning they are each occupied by two protons with spin up and spin down the pauli exclusion principle therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei the situation is similar to electrons of an atom where electrons have distinct atomic orbitals and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states with the emission of a photon by the exclusion principle neutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by beta decay as described above in this case an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay one example of this decay is carbon 14 6 protons 8 neutrons that decays to nitrogen 14 7 protons 7 neutrons with a half life of about 5 730 years inside a nucleus a proton can transform into a neutron via inverse beta decay if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron this transformation occurs by emission of a positron and an electron neutrino p n0 e νe the transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through electron capture p e n0 νe positron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus and quickly annihilate when they encounter electrons competition of beta decay types edit three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope copper 64 29 protons 35 neutrons which has a half life of about 12 7 hours this isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron so either the proton or the neutron can decay this particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay by positron emission 18 or by electron capture 43 or neutron decay by electron emission 39 decay of the neutron by elementary particle physics edit the feynman diagram for beta decay of a neutron into a proton electron and electron antineutrino via an intermediate heavy w boson within the theoretical framework of standard model for particle physics the neutron is composed of two down quarks and an up quark the only possible decay mode for the neutron that conserves baryon number is for one of the neutron s quarks to change flavour via the weak interaction the decay of one of the neutron s down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a w boson by this process the standard model description of beta decay the neutron decays into a proton which contains one down and two up quarks an electron and an electron antineutrino the leading order feynman diagram for β decay of a proton into a neutron positron and electron neutrino via an intermediate w boson the decay of the proton to a neutron occurs similarly through the electroweak force the decay of one of the proton s up quarks into a down quark can be achieved by the emission of a w boson the proton decays into a neutron a positron and an electron neutrino this reaction can only occur within an atomic nucleus which has a quantum state at lower energy available for the created neutron intrinsic properties edit mass edit the mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by mass spectrometry since it has no electric charge but since the masses of a proton and of a deuteron can be measured with a mass spectrometer the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the binding energy of deuterium expressed as a positive emitted energy the latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy b d displaystyle b_ d of the single 2 224 mev gamma photon emitted when a deuteron is formed by a proton capturing a neutron this is exothermic and happens with zero energy neutrons the small recoil kinetic energy e r d displaystyle e_ rd of the deuteron about 0 06 of the total energy must also be accounted for m n m d m p b d e r d displaystyle m_ n m_ d m_ p b_ d e_ rd the energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by x ray diffraction techniques as was first done by bell and elliot in 1948 the best modern 1986 values for neutron mass by this technique are provided by greene et al 54 these give a neutron mass of mneutron 1 008644904 14 da the value for the neutron mass in mev is less accurately known due to less accuracy in the known conversion of da to mev c2 55 mneutron 939 56563 28 mev c2 another method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta decay of the neutron when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron are measured electric charge edit the total electric charge of the neutron is 0 e this zero value has been tested experimentally and the present experimental limit for the charge of the neutron is 2 8 10 22 e 6 or 3 13 10 41 c this value is consistent with zero given the experimental uncertainties indicated in parentheses by comparison the charge of the proton is 1 e magnetic moment edit main article neutron magnetic moment even though the neutron is a neutral particle the magnetic moment of a neutron is not zero the neutron is not affected by electric fields but it is affected by magnetic fields the magnetic moment of the neutron is an indication of its quark substructure and internal charge distribution 56 the value for the neutron s magnetic moment was first directly measured by luis alvarez and felix bloch at berkeley california in 1940 57 alvarez and bloch determined the magnetic moment of the neutron to be μn 1 93 2 μn where μn is the nuclear magneton in the quark model for hadrons the neutron is composed of one up quark charge 2 3 e and two down quarks charge 1 3 e 56 the magnetic moment of the neutron can be modeled as a sum of the magnetic moments of the constituent quarks 58 the calculation assumes that the quarks behave like pointlike dirac particles each having their own magnetic moment simplistically the magnetic moment of the neutron can be viewed as resulting from the vector sum of the three quark magnetic moments plus the orbital magnetic moments caused by the movement of the three charged quarks within the neutron in one of the early successes of the standard model in 1964 mirza a b beg benjamin w lee and abraham pais theoretically calculated the ratio of proton to neutron magnetic moments to be 3 2 which agrees with the experimental value to within 3 59 60 61 the measured value for this ratio is 1 45989805 34 4 a contradiction of the quantum mechanical basis of this calculation with the pauli exclusion principle led to the discovery of the color charge for quarks by oscar w greenberg in 1964 59 the above treatment compares neutrons with protons allowing the complex behavior of quarks to be subtracted out between models and merely exploring what the effects would be of differing quark charges or quark type such calculations are enough to show that the interior of neutrons is very much like that of protons save for the difference in quark composition with a down quark in the neutron replacing an up quark in the proton the neutron magnetic moment can be roughly computed by assuming a simple nonrelativistic quantum mechanical wavefunction for baryons composed of three quarks a straightforward calculation gives fairly accurate estimates for the magnetic moments of neutrons protons and other baryons 58 for a neutron the result of this calculation is that the magnetic moment of the neutron is given by μn 4 3 μd 1 3 μu where μd and μu are the magnetic moments for the down and up quarks respectively this result combines the intrinsic magnetic moments of the quarks with their orbital magnetic moments and assumes the three quarks are in a particular dominant quantum state baryon magnetic momentof quark model computed μ n displaystyle mu _ mathrm n observed μ n displaystyle mu _ mathrm n p 4 3 μu 1 3 μd 2 79 2 793 n 4 3 μd 1 3 μu 1 86 1 913 the results of this calculation are encouraging but the masses of the up or down quarks were assumed to be 1 3 the mass of a nucleon 58 the masses of the quarks are actually only about 1 that of a nucleon 62 the discrepancy stems from the complexity of the standard model for nucleons where most of their mass originates in the gluon fields virtual particles and their associated energy that are essential aspects of the strong force 62 63 furthermore the complex system of quarks and gluons that constitute a neutron requires a relativistic treatment 64 but the nucleon magnetic moment has been successfully computed numerically from first principles including all of the effects mentioned and using more realistic values for the quark masses the calculation gave results that were in fair agreement with measurement but it required significant computing resources 65 66 spin edit the neutron is a spin 1 2 particle that is it is a fermion with intrinsic angular momentum equal to 1 2 ħ where ħ is the reduced planck constant for many years after the discovery of the neutron its exact spin was ambiguous although it was assumed to be a spin 1 2 dirac particle the possibility that the neutron was a spin 3 2 particle lingered the interactions of the neutron s magnetic moment with an external magnetic field were exploited to finally determine the spin of the neutron 67 in 1949 hughes and burgy measured neutrons reflected from a ferromagnetic mirror and found that the angular distribution of the reflections was consistent with spin 1 2 68 in 1954 sherwood stephenson and bernstein employed neutrons in a stern gerlach experiment that used a magnetic field to separate the neutron spin states they recorded two such spin states consistent with a spin 1 2 particle 67 69 as a fermion the neutron is subject to the pauli exclusion principle two neutrons cannot have the same quantum numbers this is the source of the degeneracy pressure which makes neutron stars possible see also delta baryon structure and geometry of charge distribution edit an article published in 2007 featuring a model independent analysis concluded that the neutron has a negatively charged exterior a positively charged middle and a negative core 70 in a simplified classical view the negative skin of the neutron assists it to be attracted to the protons with which it interacts in the nucleus but the main attraction between neutrons and protons is via the nuclear force which does not involve electric charge the simplified classical view of the neutron s charge distribution also explains the fact that the neutron magnetic dipole points in the opposite direction from its spin angular momentum vector as compared to the proton this gives the neutron in effect a magnetic moment which resembles a negatively charged particle this can be reconciled classically with a neutral neutron composed of a charge distribution in which the negative sub parts of the neutron have a larger average radius of distribution and therefore contribute more to the particle s magnetic dipole moment than do the positive parts that are on average nearer the core electric dipole moment edit main article neutron electric dipole moment the standard model of particle physics predicts a tiny separation of positive and negative charge within the neutron leading to a permanent electric dipole moment 71 but the predicted value is well below the current sensitivity of experiments from several unsolved puzzles in particle physics it is clear that the standard model is not the final and full description of all particles and their interactions new theories going beyond the standard model generally lead to much larger predictions for the electric dipole moment of the neutron currently there are at least four experiments trying to measure for the first time a finite neutron electric dipole moment including cryogenic neutron edm experiment being set up at the institut laue langevin 72 nedm experiment under construction at the new ucn source at the paul scherrer institute 73 nedm experiment being envisaged at the spallation neutron source 74 75 nedm experiment being built at the institut laue langevin 76 antineutron edit main article antineutron the antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron it was discovered by bruce cork in 1956 a year after the antiproton was discovered cpt symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles so studying antineutrons provides stringent tests on cpt symmetry the fractional difference in the masses of the neutron and antineutron is 9 6 10 5 since the difference is only about two standard deviations away from zero this does not give any convincing evidence of cpt violation 11 neutron compounds edit dineutrons and tetraneutrons edit main articles dineutron and tetraneutron the existence of stable clusters of 4 neutrons or tetraneutrons has been hypothesised by a team led by francisco miguel marqués at the cnrs laboratory for nuclear physics based on observations of the disintegration of beryllium 14 nuclei this is particularly interesting because current theory suggests that these clusters should not be stable in february 2016 japanese physicist susumu shimoura of the university of tokyo and co workers reported they had observed the purported tetraneutrons for the first time experimentally 77 nuclear physicists around the world say this discovery if confirmed would be a milestone in the field of nuclear physics and certainly would deepen our understanding of the nuclear forces 78 79 the dineutron is another hypothetical particle in 2012 artemis spyrou from michigan state university and coworkers reported that they observed for the first time the dineutron emission in the decay of 16be the dineutron character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two neutrons the authors measured the two neutron separation energy to be 1 35 10 mev in good agreement with shell model calculations using standard interactions for this mass region 80 neutronium and neutron stars edit main articles neutronium and neutron star at extremely high pressures and temperatures nucleons and electrons are believed to collapse into bulk neutronic matter called neutronium this is presumed to happen in neutron stars the extreme pressure inside a neutron star may deform the neutrons into a cubic symmetry allowing tighter packing of neutrons 81 detection edit main article neutron detection the common means of detecting a charged particle by looking for a track of ionization such as in a cloud chamber does not work for neutrons directly neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable but the experiments are not as simple to carry out other means for detecting neutrons consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei are more commonly used the commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon mainly neutron capture or elastic scattering 82 neutron detection by neutron capture edit a common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from neutron capture reactions into electrical signals certain nuclides have a high neutron capture cross section which is the probability of absorbing a neutron upon neutron capture the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation for example an alpha particle which is then detected the nuclides 3he 6li 10b 233u 235u 237np and 239pu are useful for this purpose neutron detection by elastic scattering edit neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei causing the struck nucleus to recoil kinematically a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions charge and or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal a major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector methods such as pulse shape discrimination can be used in distinguishing neutron signals from gamma ray signals although certain inorganic scintillator based detectors have been developed 83 84 to selectively detect neutrons in mixed radiation fields inherently without any additional techniques fast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator and are therefore capable of measuring the neutron s energy time of arrival and in certain cases direction of incidence sources and production edit main articles neutron source neutron generator and research reactor free neutrons are unstable although they have the longest half life of any unstable subatomic particle by several orders of magnitude their half life is still only about 10 minutes so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them continuously natural neutron background a small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on earth in the atmosphere and deep into the ocean the neutron background is caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere these high energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil there in striking atomic nuclei among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus within the earth s crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals the neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events such as hypothesized interactions that might be caused by particles of dark matter 12 recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of mev 85 recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10 9 and 10 13 per ms and per m2 depending on the detection altitude the energy of most of these neutrons even with initial energies of 20 mev decreases down to the kev range within 1 ms 86 even stronger neutron background radiation is produced at the surface of mars where the atmosphere is thick enough to generate neutrons from cosmic ray muon production and neutron spallation but not thick enough to provide significant protection from the neutrons produced these neutrons not only produce a martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct downward going neutron radiation but may also produce a significant hazard from reflection of neutrons from the martian surface which will produce reflected neutron radiation penetrating upward into a martian craft or habitat from the floor 87 sources of neutrons for research these include certain types of radioactive decay spontaneous fission and neutron emission and from certain nuclear reactions convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides often beryllium or deuterium and induced nuclear fission such as occurs in nuclear reactors in addition high energy nuclear reactions such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei small tabletop particle accelerators optimized to produce free neutrons in this way are called neutron generators in practice the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production one noted neutron producing radioisotope californium 252 decays half life 2 65 years by spontaneous fission 3 of the time with production of 3 7 neutrons per fission and is used alone as a neutron source from this process nuclear reaction sources that involve two materials powered by radioisotopes use an alpha decay source plus a beryllium target or else a source of high energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes beta decay followed by gamma decay which produces photoneutrons on interaction of the high energy gamma ray with ordinary stable beryllium or else with the deuterium in heavy water a popular source of the latter type is radioactive antimony 124 plus beryllium a system with a half life of 60 9 days which can be constructed from natural antimony which is 42 8 stable antimony 123 by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor then transported to where the neutron source is needed 88 institut laue langevin ill in grenoble france a major neutron research facility nuclear fission reactors naturally produce free neutrons their role is to sustain the energy producing chain reaction the intense neutron radiation can also be used to produce various radioisotopes through the process of neutron activation which is a type of neutron capture experimental nuclear fusion reactors produce free neutrons as a waste product but it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy and converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge fusion reactors that generate neutrons are likely to create radioactive waste but the waste is composed of neutron activated lighter isotopes which have relatively short 50 100 years decay periods as compared to typical half lives of 10 000 years 89 for fission waste which is long due primarily to the long half life of alpha emitting transuranic actinides 90 some nuclear fusion fission hybrids are proposed to make use of those neutrons to either maintain a subcritical reactor or to aid in nuclear transmutation of harmful long lived nuclear waste to shorter lived or stable nuclides neutron beams and modification of beams after production edit free neutron beams are obtained from neutron sources by neutron transport for access to intense neutron sources researchers must go to a specialized neutron facility that operates a research reactor or a spallation source the neutron s lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or accelerate them charged particles can be accelerated decelerated or deflected by electric or magnetic fields these methods have little effect on neutrons but some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the neutron s magnetic moment neutrons can be controlled by methods that include moderation reflection and velocity selection thermal neutrons can be polarized by transmission through magnetic materials in a method analogous to the faraday effect for photons cold neutrons of wavelengths of 6 7 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high degree of polarization by use of magnetic mirrors and magnetized interference filters 91

frm ii ill isis neutron and muon source jinr sinq historic ipns hfbr under construction ess vte the neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions for example neutron capture often results in neutron activation inducing radioactivity in particular knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons the fissioning of elements like uranium 235 and plutonium 239 is caused by their absorption of neutrons cold thermal and hot neutron radiation is commonly employed in neutron scattering facilities where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses x rays for the analysis of condensed matter neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering cross sections sensitivity to magnetism energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy and deep penetration into matter the development of neutron lenses based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron gamma ray tomography 92 93 94 95 a major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt gamma rays from elements in materials this forms the basis of neutron activation analysis naa and prompt gamma neutron activation analysis pgnaa naa is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a nuclear reactor whilst pgnaa is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around bore holes and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts another use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules when a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus it loses a large fraction of its energy by measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei a neutron probe may determine the water content in soil medical therapies edit main articles fast neutron therapy and neutron capture therapy of cancer because neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing it can be exploited for medical treatments however neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side effect of leaving the affected area radioactive neutron tomography is therefore not a viable medical application fast neutron therapy uses high energy neutrons typically greater than 20 mev to treat cancer radiation therapy of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation if radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas normal tissue will have time to repair itself while tumor cells often cannot 96 neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than gamma radiation 97 beams of low energy neutrons are used in boron neutron capture therapy to treat cancer in boron neutron capture therapy the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted the tumor is then bombarded with very low energy neutrons although often higher than thermal energy which are captured by the boron 10 isotope in the boron which produces an excited state of boron 11 that then decays to produce lithium 7 and an alpha particle that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell but insufficient range to damage nearby cells for such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million 109 neutrons per second per cm2 is preferred such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor protection edit exposure to free neutrons can be hazardous since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to molecules and atoms and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of radiation such as protons the normal precautions of radiation protection apply avoid exposure stay as far from the source as possible and keep exposure time to a minimum but particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure for other types of radiation e g alpha particles beta particles or gamma rays material of a high atomic number and with high density makes for good shielding frequently lead is used however this approach will not work with neutrons since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number as it does with alpha beta and gamma radiation instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter see the section on detection above for example hydrogen rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons this often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials after slowing neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation such as lithium 6 hydrogen rich ordinary water affects neutron absorption in nuclear fission reactors usually neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required clarification needed the deuterium in heavy water has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium normal light hydrogen deuterium is therefore used in candu type reactors in order to slow moderate neutron velocity to increase the probability of nuclear fission compared to neutron capture neutron temperature edit main article neutron temperature thermal neutrons edit thermal neutrons are free neutrons whose energies have a maxwell boltzmann distribution with kt 0 0253 ev 4 0 10 21 j at room temperature this gives characteristic not average or median speed of 2 2 km s the name thermal comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating see kinetic theory for energies and speeds of molecules after a number of collisions often in the range of 10 20 with nuclei neutrons arrive at this energy level provided that they are not absorbed in many substances thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross section than reactions involving faster neutrons and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily i e with higher probability by any atomic nuclei that they collide with creating a heavier and often unstable isotope of the chemical element as a result most fission reactors use a neutron moderator to slow down or thermalize the neutrons that are emitted by nuclear fission so that they are more easily captured causing further fission others called fast breeder reactors use fission energy neutrons directly cold neutrons edit cold neutrons are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid deuterium such a cold source is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source cold neutrons are particularly valuable for neutron scattering experiments 98 the use of cold and very cold neutrons vcn have been a bit limited compared to the use of thermal neutrons due to the relatively lower flux and lack in optical components however innovative solutions have been proposed to offer more options to the scientific community to promote the use of vcn 99 100 cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid hydrogen ultracold neutrons edit ultracold neutrons are produced by inelastic scattering of cold neutrons in substances with a low neutron absorption cross section at a temperature of a few kelvins such as solid deuterium 101 or superfluid helium 102 an alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons exploiting the doppler shift 103 104 fission energy neutrons edit main article nuclear fission a fast neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to 1 mev 1 6 10 13 j hence a speed of 14000 km s 5 of the speed of light they are named fission energy or fast neutrons to distinguish them from lower energy thermal neutrons and high energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as nuclear fission neutrons produced in fission as noted above have a maxwell boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to 14 mev a mean energy of 2 mev for 235u fission neutrons and a mode of only 0 75 mev which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in fertile materials such as 238u and 232th fast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation this is done with a neutron moderator in reactors typically heavy water light water or graphite are used to moderate neutrons fusion neutrons edit the fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off the d t rate peaks at a lower temperature about 70 kev or 800 million kelvins and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy further information nuclear fusion criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions d t deuterium tritium fusion is the fusion reaction that produces the most energetic neutrons with 14 1 mev of kinetic energy and traveling at 17 of the speed of light d t fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite reaching near peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14 1 mev that will be produced 14 1 mev neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons and are very effective at fissioning even non fissile heavy nuclei and these high energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower energy neutrons this makes d t fusion neutron sources such as proposed tokamak power reactors useful for transmutation of transuranic waste 14 1 mev neutrons can also produce neutrons by knocking them loose from nuclei on the other hand these very high energy neutrons are less likely to simply be captured without causing fission or spallation for these reasons nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes d t fusion 14 1 mev neutrons to cause more fission fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non fissile materials such as depleted uranium uranium 238 and these materials have been used in the jackets of thermonuclear weapons fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs such as reactor grade plutonium this physical fact thus causes ordinary non weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain nuclear proliferation discussions and treaties other fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons d d fusion produces a 2 45 mev neutron and helium 3 half of the time and produces tritium and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time d 3he fusion produces no neutron intermediate energy neutrons edit transmutation flow in light water reactor which is a thermal spectrum reactor a fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron cross sections for both capture and fission reactions often have multiple resonance peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range these are of less significance in a fast neutron reactor where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range or in a well moderated thermal reactor where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei not with either fissile or fertile actinide nuclides but in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei there are greater possibilities for transient changes in reactivity that might make reactor control more difficult ratios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse more captures without fission in most nuclear fuels such as plutonium 239 making epithermal spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a nuclide that is not fissile with thermal or epithermal neutrons though still fissionable with fast neutrons the exception is uranium 233 of the thorium cycle which has good capture fission ratios at all neutron energies high energy neutrons edit high energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by particle accelerators or in the atmosphere from cosmic rays these high energy neutrons are extremely efficient at ionization and far more likely to cause cell death than x rays or protons 105 106 see also edit wikimedia commons has media related to

six seconds apart more than four standard deviations commenting that our 2006 2008 and 2010 reviews stayed with 885 7 0 8 s but we noted that in light of serebrov 05 our value should be regarded as suspect until further experiments clarified matters since our 2010 review pichlmaier 10 has obtained a mean life of 880 7 1 8 s closer to the value of serebrov 05 than to our average and serebrov 10b claims their values should be lowered by about 6 s which would bring them into line with the two lower values but those re evaluations have not received an enthusiastic response from the experimenters in question and in any case the particle data group would have to await published changes by those experimenters of published values at this point we can think of nothing better to do than to average the seven best but discordant measurements getting 881 5 1 5 s note that the error includes a scale factor of 2 7 this is a jump of 4 2 old and 2 8 new standard deviations this state of affairs is a

also starred in the lead role as the title character a descendant of the infamous dr victor frankenstein peter boyle portrayed the monster 4 the film co stars teri garr cloris leachman marty feldman madeline kahn kenneth mars richard haydn and gene hackman the film is a parody of the classic horror film genre in particular the various film adaptations of mary shelley s 1818 novel frankenstein or the modern prometheus produced by universal pictures in the 1930s 5 much of the lab equipment used as props was created by kenneth strickfaden for the 1931 film frankenstein 6 to help evoke the atmosphere of the earlier films brooks shot the picture entirely in black and white a rarity in the 1970s and employed 1930s style opening credits and scene transitions such as iris outs wipes and fades to black the film also features a period score by brooks longtime composer john morris a critical favorite and box office hit young frankenstein ranks no 28 on total film magazine s readers list of the 50 greatest comedy films of all time 7 no 56 on bravo s list of the 100 funniest movies 8 and no 13 on the american film institute s list of the 100 funniest american movies 9 in 2003 it was deemed culturally historically or aesthetically significant by the united states national film preservation board and selected for preservation in the library of congress national film registry 10 11 it was later adapted by brooks and thomas meehan as a stage musical the film received nominations for the academy award for best sound and best adapted screenplay the latter of which was a nomination shared with wilder and brooks on its 40th anniversary brooks considered it by far his finest although not his funniest film as a writer and director respectively 12 contents 1 plot 2 cast 3 production

physician at an american medical school and engaged to elizabeth a socialite he becomes exasperated when anyone brings up the subject of his grandfather victor frankenstein the infamous mad scientist with whom he does not want to be associated and insists that his surname is pronounced fronkensteen 13 when a solicitor informs him that he has inherited his family s estate in transylvania after the death of his great grandfather the baron beaufort von frankenstein frederick travels to europe to inspect the property at the transylvania train station he is met by a hunchbacked bug eyed servant named igor whose own grandfather worked for victor and a beautiful young female assistant named inga hearing that the professor pronounces his name fronkensteen igor insists that his name is pronounced eyegor rather than the traditional eegor arriving at the estate frederick meets frau blücher the intimidating housekeeper after discovering the secret entrance to victor s laboratory and reading his private journals frederick decides to resume his grandfather s experiments in re animating the dead he and igor steal the corpse of a recently executed criminal and frederick sets to work experimenting on the large corpse he sends igor to steal the brain of a deceased scientist and saint hans delbrück startled by his own reflection igor drops and ruins delbrück s brain taking a second brain labeled abnormal igor returns with it and frederick transplants it into the corpse thinking he has transplanted delbrück s brain frederick brings the creature to life by electrical charges during a lightning storm the creature takes its first steps but frightened by igor lighting a match he attacks frederick and nearly strangles him before he is sedated meanwhile unaware of the creature s existence the townspeople gather to discuss their unease at frederick continuing his grandfather s work inspector kemp a one eyed police official with a prosthetic arm whose german accent is so thick that even his own countrymen cannot understand him 14 proposes to visit the doctor whereupon he demands assurance that frankenstein will not create another monster returning to the lab frederick discovers blücher setting the creature free she reveals the monster s love of violin music and her own romantic relationship with frederick s grandfather the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch and escapes the castle while roaming the countryside the monster has encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit references to 1931 s frankenstein and 1935 s bride of frankenstein respectively 15 frederick recaptures the monster and locks himself in a room with him he calms the monster s homicidal tendencies with flattery and a promise to guide him to success embracing his heritage as a frankenstein at a theater full of illustrious guests frederick shows the creature following simple commands the demonstration continues with frederick and the monster both in top hats and tuxedos performing the musical number puttin on the ritz a stage light suddenly explodes and frightens the monster interrupting the performance the audience boo and throw vegetables at the monster who becomes enraged and charges into the audience where he is captured and chained by police back in the laboratory inga attempts to comfort frederick and they fornicate on the suspended reanimation table the monster escapes from prison the same night that frederick s fiancée elizabeth arrives unexpectedly for a visit the monster takes her captive as he flees elizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his enormous schwanzstucker 16 while the townspeople hunt for the monster frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle and recaptures him just as the kemp led mob storms the laboratory frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who reasons with and placates the mob elizabeth with her hair styled after that of the female creature from bride of frankenstein marries the now erudite and sophisticated monster while inga in bed with frederick asks what her new husband got in return during the transfer procedure frederick growls wordlessly and embraces inga who as elizabeth did when abducted by the monster sings the refrain ah sweet mystery of life 17 cast edit gene wilder as dr frederick frankenstein peter boyle as the

lou cutell as frightened villager ian abercrombie as second villager production edit in a 2010 interview with los angeles times mel brooks discussed how the film came about i was in the middle of shooting the last few weeks of blazing saddles somewhere in the antelope valley and gene wilder and i were having a cup of coffee and he said i have this idea that there could be another frankenstein i said not another we ve had the son of the cousin of the brother in law we don t need another frankenstein his idea was very simple what if the grandson of dr frankenstein wanted nothing to do with the family whatsoever he was ashamed of those wackos i said that s funny 20 in one of the scenes of a village assembly one of the authority figures says that he already knows what frankenstein is up to based on five previous experiences this is a reference to the first five universal films 21 in a gene wilder dvd interview he says the film is based on frankenstein 1931 the bride of frankenstein 1935 son of frankenstein 1939 and the ghost of frankenstein 1942 in a 2016 interview with creative screenwriting brooks elaborated on the writing process he recalled little by little every night gene and i met at his bungalow at the bel air hotel we ordered a pot of earl grey tea coupled with a container of cream and a small kettle of brown sugar cubes to go with it we had a pack of british digestive biscuits and step by step ever so cautiously we proceeded on a dark narrow twisting path to the eventual screenplay in which good sense and caution are thrown out the window and madness ensues 22 brooks and wilder argued over the sequence where frankenstein and his creation perform puttin on the ritz brooks felt it would be too silly to have the monster sing and dance but eventually yielded to wilder s arguments in defense of the sequence 5 20 unlike in many of his other films brooks does not appear onscreen in a significant role in young frankenstein though he recorded several voice parts and portrays a german villager in one short scene in 2012 brooks explained why i wasn t allowed to be in it that was the deal gene wilder had he said if you re not in it i ll do it laughs he said you have a way of breaking the fourth wall whether you want to or not i just want to keep it i don t want too much to be you know a wink at the audience i love the script he wrote the script with me that was the deal so i wasn t in it and he did it 23 brooks and producer michael gruskoff originally agreed a deal with columbia pictures but columbia wouldn t agree to a budget of more than 1 75 million whereas brooks wanted at least 2 3 million columbia also weren t happy making it in black and white so brooks and gruskoff instead went to 20th century fox for distribution after they agreed to a higher budget 21 24 principal photography began on february 19 1974 and wrapped on may 3 1974 25 to recreate the visual style of the old universal horror films brooks shot the film in black and white employed vintage style opening credits used wipes and irises for scene transitions and even used the original kenneth strickfaden lab equipment from the 1931 frankenstein 5 marty feldman added a comic twist to his character by deliberately swapping which side the hump on his back was located when doctor frankenstein asks him about it igor replies simply what hump wilder had written the role specifically for feldman 26 reception edit young frankenstein was a box office success upon release the film grossed 86 2 million on a 2 78 million budget 3 young frankenstein received critical acclaim from critics and currently holds a 94 fresh rating on rotten tomatoes based on 64 reviews with an average rating of 8 6 10 the consensus reads made with obvious affection for the original young frankenstein is a riotously silly spoof featuring a fantastic performance by gene wilder 27 vincent canby of the new york times called the film mel brooks funniest most cohesive comedy to date adding it would be misleading to describe young frankenstein written by mr wilder and mr brooks as astoundingly witty but it s a great deal of low fun of the sort that mr brooks specializes in 28 roger ebert gave the film a full four stars calling it brooks most disciplined and visually inventive film it also happens to be very funny 29 gene siskel gave the film three stars out of four and wrote part homage and part send up young frankenstein is very funny in its best moments but they re all too infrequent 30 variety declared the screen needs one outrageously funny mel brooks film each year and young frankenstein is an excellent followup for the enormous audiences that howled for much of 1974 at blazing saddles 31 charles champlin of the los angeles times praised the film as a likable unpredictable blending of slapstick and sentiment 32 gary arnold of the washington post who disliked blazing saddles reported being equally untickled with young frankenstein and wrote that wilder and brooks haven t dreamed up a funny plot they simply rely on the old movie plots to get them through a rambling collection of scene parodies and a more or less constant stream of puns double entendres and other verbal rib pokers and thigh slappers 33 tom milne of the uk s the monthly film bulletin wrote in a mixed review that all too often brooks resorts to the most clichéd sort of carry on smut and criticized marty feldman s grotesquely unfunny mugging but praised a couple of sequences the flower throwing scene and the monster s encounter with the blind man as very close to brilliance and called peter boyle as the monster one of the undiluted pleasures of the film and the only actor ever to suggest that he might play the part as well as karloff 34 in his book comedy horror films a chronological history 1914 2008 bruce g hallenbeck lauded many of young frankenstein s scenes as classic comedy moments and also praised the attention to detail the film shows in paying heartfelt homage to the classic horror films it references he summed up that young frankenstein is a movie for film buffs but written directed and performed in such a way that average joes and josephines can enjoy it just as much for its outrageous and wacky humor 5 walk this way edit igor s line walk this way in the film inspired the song of the same name by aerosmith 35 according to gene wilder the joke was added while shooting the scene by mel brooks inspired by the old talcum powder joke 36 a partially contradictory account appears in eye marty feldman s posthumously published autobiography feldman recalls spontaneously doing the walk this way shtick to make his colleagues laugh with brooks then insisting despite wilder s and feldman s reservations that it stay in the film 37 home media edit young frankenstein became available on dvd on november 3 1998 38 the film was then released on dvd for the second time on september 5 2006 39 the film was then released on dvd for the third time on september 9 2014 as a 40th anniversary edition along with a blu ray release 40 musical adaptation edit main article young frankenstein musical brooks adapted the film into a musical

ma pa kent one dead we re going with the version where pa kent has died that s the day superboy becomes a man 76 dialogue between several characters implies that young clark is a costumed adventurer but he is never referred to as superboy 75 legal status edit the superboy character has been the subject of a legal battle between time warner the owner of dc comics and the estates of jerry siegel and joe shuster on november 30 1938 siegel pitched the idea for the character of superboy to detective comics the corporate forerunner to dc comics but the company declined the offer siegel pitched the idea again in december 1940 but again the company declined to use the material siegel enlisted in the u s army in july 1943 while he was stationed overseas detective comics directed joe shuster to draw a superboy comic strip for publication in more fun comics no notice was given to siegel and no consent from him was granted 77 78 siegel sued for copyright infringement and won a court appointed special referee declared the character of superboy unique and not derivative from the character of superman but appeals by both siegel and national comics publication the new name of detective comics led to a consent decree in which the parties agreed that superboy was the sole property of national comics 78 79 in 1969 siegel and shuster sought to recover their copyright to superman as the original 28 year copyright for the character had expired in siegel v national periodical publications inc 364 f supp 1032 s d n y 1973 aff d 508 f 2d 909 2nd cir 1974 the united states district court for the southern district of new york held that the 1948 agreement assigned not only the original 28 year copyright term but also the 28 year copyright renewal term as well to national periodical publications detective comics successor 80 in 1976 congress enacted a new copyright act this law extended existing copyrights for 19 years but it also gave creators of works the right to seek to recover their copyright when the extension was up the siegel claims edit in 1997 joanne siegel siegel s surviving wife and laura siegel larson siegel s daughter filed a notice exercising their rights to terminate dc comics copyright on the superman character the date of termination was 1999 but dc comics provided joanne siegel with certain benefits that induced the parties to keep negotiating a tolling agreement was signed to allow negotiations to keep moving 81 a the siegels shusters and dc comics began drafting an agreement and this agreement now referenced the superboy character and some indicia as well 81 on october 19 2001 larson s attorney issued a letter in which he claimed that the heirs accepted d c comics offer of october 16 2001 in respect of the superman and spectre properties 83 further negotiations broke down in 2002 and the siegel heirs filed suit in the u s district court for the central district of california claiming their half of the superboy copyright 84 on march 23 2006 judge ronald s w lew of the district court for the central district of california issued a summary judgment ruling that siegel s heirs had successfully reclaimed the copyright to the superboy character and related indicia as of november 17 2004 85 86 judge lew s decision left the parties in the unenviable situation of the siegels owning the copyright to superboy but time warner owning the trademark leaving neither party fully able to take advantage of their respective properties alone 87 at a subsequent trial in october 2006 time warner now the parent company of dc comics defended itself against a copyright infringement suit by the siegels by arguing that judge lew s summary judgment was incorrect in siegel v time warner 496 f supp 2d 1111 c d cal 2007 judge stephen g larson vacated judge lew s summary judgment and ordered a new trial on the issues b larson s ruling did not determine whether superboy was such a unique character that the character enjoyed its own copyright protection he said it was up to future litigation to determine whether the differences between superman and superboy were trivial and did not create a copyrightable character 86 attorney jesse j kruger however noted that character reboots and retcons could create enough differences so that any future version of superboy might avoid a claim by the siegels 86 the legal dispute affected dc comics treatment of the various incarnations of superboy in the secret origin of the teen titans back up story march 28 2007 in the weekly 52 limited series an illustration of superboy was changed into wonder girl 88 in the sinestro corps war storyline in the green lantern titles and in the countdown to final crisis limited series the superboy prime character was referred to as superman prime a development that came about in part because of the legal dispute 89 on march 26 2008 in siegel v warner bros entertainment inc 542 f supp 2d 1098 1145 c d cal 2008 judge larson ruled again that the superboy character was not a work for hire 90 larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the siegel heirs claim to the superman and superboy works 91 c the siegels regained the copyright to the superman character story and indicia as they appeared in action comics 1 but not prior to or after that 92 93 judge larson later expanded his ruling to allow the siegel heirs to claim additional plots superman characters costuming and indicia 94 95 this included the story of superman s origin as a kryptonian rocketed to earth from a dying planet in a spaceship created by his father 96 dc comics celebrated the decisions as they restored certain retconned versions of the superboy character to the company s use on june 28 2008 dc comics vice president and executive editor dan didio said in reference to the legion of three worlds comic at the wizard world chicago convention we ve got geoff johns writer we ve got george pérez artist we ve got superboy prime yes we can say that again 97 in january 2013 the ninth circuit court of appeals returned all rights over the superboy character and other indicia to dc comics 98 the appellate court held in larson v warner bros entertainment no 11 56034 d c no 2 04 cv 08400 odw rz 9 cir january 10 2013 that the district court for the central district of california erred when it said in 2008 that dc and the siegel heirs had not reached an agreement in 2001 resolving the dispute over the copyright the court of appeals remanded the case back to the district court with an order to find that a contract existed copyright attorney dallas kratzer said that the ninth circuit s ruling rendered moot all of the other questions in this lawsuit 99 the hollywood reporter said the ruling likely precludes any further attempt by the siegel heirs to terminate dc comics copyright ownership of the character although an appeal to the u s supreme court is not barred the ninth circuit also ruled 100 that dc comics could move ahead with a tortious interference lawsuit against siegel attorney marc toberoff whom dc accuses of interfering with the 2001 settlement 101 on remand the district court for the central district of california found that the 2001 agreement had terminated the siegel heirs rights to superboy the siegel heirs appealed arguing that the 2001 agreement did not cover the superboy copyrights because the rights at that time were not the siegels to grant 102 103 they also argued that the agreement alienated their copyrights contrary to law 103 d finally the heirs argued that joanne siegel had rescinded the 2001 agreement in 2002 an action in which dc comics had agreed 102 103 the ninth circuit court of appeals rejected all these arguments 102 the shuster claims edit joe shuster died in 1992 after his death dc comics and his sister jean shuster peavy entered into an agreement in which the company paid shuster s debts made survivor payments to shuster s brother frank and paid jean 25 000 a year for the rest of her life jean shuster peavy and frank shuster agreed to turn over all copyright interest in shuster s detective comics characters to dc comics the agreement also barred the shuster family from asserting these rights in the future 104 the agreement did not however specifically mention superman or superboy 105 in 2003 the joe shuster estate filed suit to recover shuster s copyright interest in superman superboy and other characters dc comics counter sued arguing the 1992 agreement barred any such claim in 2012 the u s district court for the central district of california held in dc comics v pacific pictures corp no cv 10 3633 odw rzx 2012 wl 4936588 c d cal oct 17 2012 that the 1992 agreement s broad all inclusive language was more than adequate to cover the superman and superboy copyrights in which shuster had an interest thus the estate was barred from seeking their termination under the copyright act whatever interest shuster had in superboy stayed with dc comics 105 the u s supreme court declined to hear the shuster family s appeal in october 2014 leaving the district court s ruling intact 106 in other media edit the adventures

powers jonathan s superhero outfit is very similar to kon el s original superboy costume notes edit sometimes the statute of limitations may run out during negotiations rather than have negotiations end and the parties return to court the parties will sign a tolling agreement in which they agree not to invoke the statute of limitations this preserves the rights of the aggrieved party but also may serve as an inducement to keep bargaining 82 judge larson determined that the 1947 agreement was conclusive as to matters of law and the issues therein could not be relitigated e g it met the requirements for collateral estoppel larson concluded that the superboy character was not a work for hire however because of the way in which the character first saw light in more fun comics larson was not able to determine whether publication had occurred as defined by the copyright act publication was essential to asserting copyright and detective comics could not publish a character to which they lacked the rights larson was also unable to determine if superboy was a joint work by both siegel and shuster judge larson noted that although there was a 2001 letter from the siegels saying they had agreed to terms offered by time warner the subsequent confusion over what these terms were and the inclusion of what the siegels claimed were new provisions not previously discussed by the parties meant that in fact no agreement had been reached under california law 17 u s c 203 a 5 and 17 u s c 304 c 5 says that termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant references edit indicia changed to superboy the legion of super heroes with issue 231 the indicia changed to adventures of

communicationssuperman revenge squad morgan edge is a fictional character appearing in american comic books published by dc comics originally a supporting character he is a media mogul who acquires the daily planet and employs clark kent as a television journalist for his wgbs tv network after the crisis on infinite earth series which led to a revision of the dc universe the character was changed to a superman villain and one of the known leaders of intergang 1 adrian pasdar portrayed morgan edge in the arrowverse series supergirl in superman lois adam rayner played a version of the character who is also superman s kryptonian half brother named tal rho contents 1 publication history 2 fictional character biography 2 1 pre crisis 2 2 post crisis 2 3 the new 52 3 in other media 4 see also 5 references 6 external links publication history edit morgan edge first appeared in superman s pal jimmy olsen 133 and was created by jack kirby 2 kirby based his physical appearance on actor kevin mccarthy while his personality was inspired by television executive james t aubrey 3 according to kirby s production assistant mark evanier kirby wanted to explore the theme of organized crime gaining a foothold in corporate america particularly a giant media conglomerate given the shady background of the company that acquired warner bros and dc it was something of an inside joke 3 however under prodding from editorial staff who preferred edge to be an ongoing supporting character rather than a villain who would ultimately have to be brought to justice and thus written out of the series the morgan edge connected to intergang was revealed to be an imposter 3 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in his original incarnation edge was the president of the galaxy broadcasting system owners of television station wgbs the media corporation which eventually bought the daily planet edge was in many ways a stereotype of a ruthless capitalist intervening in the planet s homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older perry white but he was a decent man who had moments of good heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees including clark kent following the takeover of the planet edge transferred kent to the news division making him a traveling correspondent and later anchorman on wgbs this move added several tv co workers to the superman supporting cast including fretful producer josh coyle sports broadcaster steve lombard 4 weather forecaster oscar asherman and co anchor lana lang who had been one of clark s childhood friends in smallville as one of the wealthiest men in metropolis edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered superman the subject of many of his network s news stories whom he like most others failed to realize was also clark kent although rarely integral to a plotline edge was a supporting character in many superman stories for a while it appeared that edge was connected to the apokolips sponsored crime organisation intergang but this was revealed to be a clone created by the evil factory a genetics laboratory working for darkseid 5 for example this clone attempted to have jimmy olsen the guardian and incidentally a random daily planet employee named goody rickels a don rickles lookalike murdered as part of a cover up 6 it was later revealed that morgan edge s birth name was morris edelstein after he won his first tv station in a game of poker morris edelstein changed his name to morgan edge because he was ashamed of his lower class jewish background and kept the details of his past closely guarded 7 post crisis edit when dc continuity was rebooted after the crisis on infinite earths edge remained president of wgbs but his ties to the planet and friendship with superman were retconned away and he was genuinely connected to intergang he was eventually exposed by the daily planet in articles by clark kent and cat grant who was working for wgbs undercover edge was imprisoned but even managed to cause trouble there by publishing his autobiography on the edge which dumped upon his father vincent edge as well as cat grant revealing that she slept her way into a scoop after his release from jail morgan edge returned as sponsor of the superman revenge squad prior to his imprisonment one of his actions generated much fan anger in which edge sadistically and gleefully ran over a raccoon on the road prompting one fan to write in saying lex luthor treats people like animals but even he does not run them over intentionally recently morgan edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit with the show edge of reason where he gives off anti kryptonian spin for general lane he is also seen in a flash forward panel in adventure comics vol 2 1 making a mysterious deal with despero 8 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe morgan edge appears as a powerful and self centered media mogul and the new owner of the daily planet he is seen as the sponsor of the challengers of the unknown program before they all leave due to his ruthless business strategy this version of morgan edge is depicted as a bald african american man with a goatee 9 although a tough businessman edge did recognize talent and awarded lois lane the editorship of the daily planet edge s multiple media holdings become a benefit to superman as lois lane now director of edge s metropolis news station has said building s security cameras hacked to provide vital intelligence on a rampaging villain 10 prior to dc rebirth in the last issue of the 2011 justice league series it is mentioned that lex luthor had bought the daily planet from him 11 in other media edit a character inspired by morgan edge named bill church jr appeared in lois clark the new adventures of superman citation needed portrayed by bruce campbell similarly to edge church jr is the head of intergang and owns a tv station called multiworld communications as well as a supermarket chain to help him launder money additionally he has a father named bill church sr portrayed by peter boyle and a wife named mindy church portrayed by jessica collins morgan edge appears in smallville portrayed by rutger hauer original likeness and by patrick bergin surgically altered likeness this version is a metropolis crime lord and an old friend of lionel luthor who he grew up with in suicide slum after learning clark kent stole money from one of edge s gangs while under the influence of red kryptonite edge recruits clark to steal a package which the latter later discovers is his own blood sample from lionel s luthorcorp office when jonathan kent destroys the sample edge takes him and martha kent hostage in retaliation clark procures a new sample from himself and gives it to edge who in turn gives it to lionel promising to give him the source edge s thugs kidnap clark and attempt to bring him to metropolis but the latter escapes

miniaturized city was rescued from braniac superman placed it in his fortress of solitude where he would occasionally shrink himself and sometimes one or more guests to pay a visit to the kandorian inhabitants in kandor superman had no powers and was branded an outlaw due to a misunderstanding to protect themselves superman and jimmy created vigilante identities inspired by batman and robin however as neither bats nor robins existed on krypton superman chose the names of two native avian species nightwing for himself and flamebird for jimmy 1 at one point nightwing and flamebird teamed up with their inspirations batman and robin for an adventure in kandor which would prove especially important to the young robin 2 in superman 166 january 1964 the imaginary sons of superman go to

betty kane as bat girl fans were introduced to a similar character called mary elizabeth bette kane also known as flamebird 5 the krypton connection edit nightwing secret files 1 tells the post crisis tale of how dick grayson became nightwing but retroactively erases the notion that superman and jimmy olsen ever held the titles of nightwing or flamebird respectively the connection between bette kane s flamebird and grayson s nightwing was conjectural until 2001 s superman the man of steel 111 wherein superman and lois lane travel to a version of the kryptonian past and assume the names themselves 6 this once again associated superman with the roles directly and he revealed to lois that he had indeed related tales of both kryptonian legends to dick and bette 7 kara zor el edit this

attackers weapons furthermore unlike in previous portrayals flamebird appears to be the dominant partner it is later revealed that her real name is thara ak var chief of security for new krypton whom alura partially blames for zor el s death thara also apparently freed chris kent from the phantom zone making him the new nightwing thara s name is a reference to the pre crisis flamebird and his wife

dreams and visions involving the creature for most of her life 10 new 52 edit following the events of infinite crisis it is revealed that bette is the cousin of current batwoman kate kane in detective

to take superman s place during multiple issues of the funeral for a friend storyline after the death of superman event this led to the debut of superboy kon el in the following reign of the supermen crossover event fictional character biography edit project bloodhound edit after a career in the united states military as a soldier paul westfield became the executive director of project cadmus a secret government agency based outside of metropolis when the guardian head of security at cadmus fought the vigilante gangbuster who was revealed to be an entranced superman 1 2 he reported his encounter to westfield westfield felt that superman was a potential threat to earth and in response to guardian s report he began the early phase of a counter measure he devised called project bloodhound and monitored superman for months after incidents involving the krypton man westfield was convinced that superman s mental state was deteriorating and sends the dogs of the project mac blood and tracker to capture him while captured superman s mind was probed by the dna alien dubbilex and his thoughts were transferred to a computer after superman was rescued by the hairies advanced humanoid creations of cadmus westfield guardian and dubbilex learned from the probe that superman reluctantly killed three kryptonians general zod zaora and quex ul who killed every being on a pocket

his mentally unstable commander to save his unit of fifteen men during a war westfield relented 4 death and return of superman edit westfield wanted cadmus to create a cloned replacement for the fallen superman lex luthor posing as his own son in a clone body and his security force team luthor intervened with the planned retrieval of superman s body by federal authority a team of cadmus troops accompanied by westfield steals superman s body from the tomb at project cadmus the original plan to clone superman via a dna sample was unsuccessful as all cloning techniques were proven useless on his kryptonian body superman s body was given an electron capillary scan by the other directors of cadmus and the results along with educated guesswork created data stored on a disc that contained an approximation of superman s genetic code westfield wanted to create the clone of superman immediately and sends auron a cybernetic super soldier cloned from the guardian and created by westfield s secret genetic engineering team to retrieve the disk by force via the code word sanction blue before westfield could obtain the disk the clones of the original newsboy legion convinced auron that he was just like the original guardian based on having a link with him via his dna he rebels against westfield and departs with the digital dna disk to protect superman s legacy 5 6 after the refusal of the other directors to make a new scan and the retrieval of superman s body by lois lane supergirl and lex luthor who actively tried to stop any effort to resurrect superman by cloning westfield and his secret team of scientists genetically altered a human clone to look like superman and made the clone to be the closest human equivalent to a kryptonian as they could based on their research carl packard the project head of auron s creation was the project head for the clone s creation and was given full authority to explore whatever methods to create the clone while westfield provided him with the dna cellstock after twelve failed attempts the thirteenth clone known as experiment 13 was grown from a single cell to a teenage boy in less than a week the clone was given implanted memories and underwent an artificial maturation process to match the age of the original superman during the maturation the clone was to be programmed with command words like auron to be under westfield s control but the clone s mind refused all mental programming 7 the clone escaped from cadmus due to the actions of the newsboy legion clones he became the fourth superman claiming to be superman resurrected and refused to be called superboy following reign of the supermen superboy reveals on television that he was a result of cadmus dna experiments and that cadmus was after him after westfield secretly sent payback dnaliens to capture superboy he later sends the guardian and the clone returned to cadmus with superman the guardian superboy learned from the scientists of project cadmus that he was created from only human dna and was genetically engineered to both look like superman and mimic his major powers by a telekinetic field after learning the truth superboy agreed to let superman have the rights to the name superman trademark and symbol while superman agreed to let him use the superboy name superboy decides to go on a world tour to establish his new name and project cadmus assigns dubbilex to chaperone superboy 8 battle for metropolis edit in the battle of metropolis story arc a clone plague erupts into open warfare in the streets of metropolis

clawster took advantage of the conflict between the two forces to attack cadmus troops and innocent civilians westfield tries to exterminate the underworlders with a missile aimed at the heart of metropolis but the missile was destroyed by superman dabney donovan the creator of the underworlders and the true mastermind behind the clone virus murders westfield and cuts off westfield s ear as a trophy and possibly a source for more dna experiments as a result of the conflict the project cadmus facility was destroyed but in reality cadmus went underground and used the destruction as a cover 9 10 after a restructuring of project cadmus his replacement mickey cannon would become the sole director of project cadmus with all other directors removed legacy edit it was revealed that superboy s cellstock preserved by carl packard at the ruins of the former cadmus facility was on file at cadmus computer database superboy was a cellular match to a director and only the head of security or the executive director had full access to their cellblocks it is later revealed to superboy carl packard and the directors of cadmus that superboy was created from the cellstock of paul westfield westfield revealed via a recorded message to his superiors that he secretly provided his own genetic material based on his belief that the clone would follow westfield s own thinking as auron did with the guardian 11 westfield s preserved cellstock proved to be unusable when superboy s dna was unraveling and roxy leech one of superboy s closest friends became his new dna pattern during the meltdown arc in volume three of superboy 12 during the hypertension story arc of the superboy series a superboy from another hypertime reality was grown to full age to become superman but later became black zero in the midst of anti clone sentiment black zero conquered his world and the paul westfield of his universe considered a father figure to him was placed in charge black zero rescued other worlds

senate a parallel universe version of the character is later introduced in the show s final season who serves as clark and his allies adversary and plays a pivotal role in bringing lex back from his

restoration afterward darkseid possesses lionel s corpse to attack clark however clark destroys lionel s body dispelling darkseid s threat 23 portrayal edit lionel luthor was created by alfred gough and miles millar specifically for smallville to provide a parallel to the kents as an experiment in extreme parenting 24 the character chloe sullivan allison mack was also created for the show lex s father has previously been depicted in other media lionel luthor is portrayed in the program by john glover glover said he appreciates the clear canvas he had to work with when developing his portrayal of lionel in season one glover traveled from new york to vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in new york at the time 25 when portraying the character s struggle with terminal liver disease glover was inspired by a friend s battle with cancer he said his friend was a cheerleader to people who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad when glover s friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later this helped glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide which lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal 26 character development edit storyline progression edit in season two lionel moves from being recurring figure to a regular character this season features the gradual unveiling of lionel s increasing involvement with the characters of the show it begins with more direct involvement when luthor hires martha kent as his assistant and then indirectly when he becomes the conservator of the kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mystery of the symbols on the cave walls 27 during season three lionel becomes the villain of the show when he tries to discover clark s secret and drives lex into a psychotic breakdown this allows lionel to use electroshock therapy on lex to erase his knowledge of lionel s co opting of morgan edge to kill lionel s parents for their life insurance 26 the creative team experimented with lionel s character in season four creating a storyline in which lionel is reformed executive producer greg beeman said the character development failed and as a result lionel returned to his normal self john glover found playing lionel as a straight arrow was boring 28 season five explores the relationship between martha and lionel both annette o toole and al gough said lionel was slightly attracted to martha but that she would never act on that feeling the producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters 29 most of lionel s motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was good 30 glover said he believes lincoln cole s ian tracey actions in mercy made lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character by the end of the fifth season lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other 30 smallville s writer and executive producer brian peterson said the creative team wanted to remind the audience that lionel was still the same lionel luthor they had come know so they delayed revealing lionel s usual antics until season six s promise in which he blackmails lana into marrying lex peterson wanted to slap the audience in the face with a reminder of lionel s former character although lionel blackmails lana into marrying lex john glover said lionel was trying to protect clark for which he needed lana s help by the time season six began airing john glover realized lex was starting to become more villainous and that his time on the show would be limited glover hoped lionel would still be able to influence his son as the show progressed he believed his character would be useless on the show without such influencing abilities glover said the conflict between lex and his father is very positive for the show because lionel s attempt to bond with lex and the distrust between them makes drama 31 characterization edit john glover characterizes lionel as a businessman who is disappointed with his son to glover lionel is this rich and powerful businessman who sees his son as a wuss and fraidy cat it was important to glover that lionel appear as human as possible glover said he does not want to simply twirl his mustache 25 glover described lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants he characterizes lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily lionel uses that ability to further his goals the character can also get past people s defenses and manipulate them glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than lionel 27 lionel s character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the sinister nature of the character 32 lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or clinical blue background lionel s signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power by growing it out and refusing to style it lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash 33 relationships edit the relationship between lionel and his son lex is strained it has been likened to the relationship between norman and harry osborn in the spider man movie 1 glover tried to make lionel appear as though he is trying to toughen lex up the character is made to go out of his way to give lex tests so lex can prove himself 25 glover sees the character as a rich and powerful businessman who is disappointed in his son glover s goal for season one was to show lionel s attempts to make lex tougher he interprets the character s motto in his raising of lex as no risk no rewards 25 what i was working on and continue to work on is to see him strengthen lex lionel doesn t seem to be a man who wants his son to be afraid so he s gone out of his way to give him tests so he can prove himself that s what locking him inside the plant in jitters was all about lionel makes the decision to close the gate it s a tough decision but he knows that if lex survives he will be a stronger person no risk no reward glover explains lionel s parenting techniques 25 glover believes lionel has two competing agendas with lex for lex to become his own man and for lex to follow in his father s steps this becomes frustrating for lex because lionel wants his son to be both loyal follower and the best person he can be this all plays into lionel s pretty huge ego 26 john glover believes if lionel and lex were not related lionel would have destroyed lex early on because he views his son as weak lionel is also bound by the fact that lex is his heir although he does not trust lex lionel s distrust of lex partially arises because he believes lex is a coward john glover said it s not that lionel is meant to be a foe it s just that the poor boy s weak so lionel must mold him lionel is continually trying to strengthen his son to teach him lex is just a hard student 28 lionel also has a key relationship with martha kent clark kent s adoptive mother this relationship first develops in season two when lionel hires martha to be his assistant 27 it is further developed in season five 29 glover felt lionel s attraction to martha grows in season five when jonathan kent dies because he now sees martha as a single woman and is now more attainable glover believes lionel was seeking to attain martha s goodness and the attraction is not based on lust when lionel is in martha s company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior writer holly harold said his relationship with martha parallels lex s relationship with lana both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side 30 annette o toole said martha s interest in lionel is like watching a dangerous animal it s that attraction you have for a very beautiful dangerous animal you know you can t stop watching it but at the same time you feel oh my god he s going to kill me o toole also said she believes martha s motivation is to get close enough to lionel to know what he is planning to do to clark when martha left the show writer todd slavkin said they wanted to give the character more of a send off than they achieved on screen slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave john schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in the writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the u s senate creating a parallel to clark where martha fights injustice on the political stage 34 o toole and al gough said martha has a small attraction to lionel and that nothing serious would come from it 29 glover believes martha influenced lionel to start believing that sacrifice is necessary to make the world a better place when she leaves at the end of season six lionel no longer has that influence he is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality according to series writer caroline dries the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act dries said this is embodied when he threatens lana into marrying lex later revealing it was to protect clark 31 glover describes his off screen relationship with annette o toole the reason martha and lionel have such good chemistry glover said that when martha and lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and o toole are sharing a conversation and that trust is visualized on the camera 30 reception edit for his portrayal of lionel luthor

the second in 2004 35 36 by season four one reviewer said lionel should have left the show after succumbing to his terminal liver disease in season three maurice cobbs of dvd verdict said lionel was
