she can steal power of a target being is unknown but potentially limitless as she borrows alan scott s abilities during the prison breakouts while he is in space she also stole the powers of dark orko

the ability to steal the powers of two beings simultaneously in the helmet of fate miniseries she takes the powers of two heroes of her choice while in school and exudes magical abilities of her own
