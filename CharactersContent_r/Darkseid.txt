other methods most notably through his minion glorious godfrey who could control people s minds with his voice he had a special interest in earth as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most if not all fragments of the anti life equation darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the equation this has caused him to clash with many superheroes of the dc universe most notably the kryptonian superman darkseid worked behind the scenes using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow earth including working through intergang a

and for all however darkseid s life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time where he was reborn as boss dark side aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain libra

racer to darkseid and making contact with him frees turpin from darkseid s control wonder woman having been freed from possession by one of darkseid s minions then uses her lasso of truth to bind

and many abilities his best known and most used ability is shooting omega beams from his eyes powered by a cosmic energy source called the omega effect the beams are an intense form of heated energy that can act as a concussive force can disintegrate organisms or objects can cause a target to have never existed and can resurrect fallen beings killed by them during the final crisis darkseid used his omega beams to grant power to mary marvel and her powers afterwards were based on anti life rather than magic darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy and can direct the beams to travel in straight lines curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy some super powered beings such as superman and doomsday can resist the beams although in the case of superman with a great deal of pain orion and diana were able to deflect them firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story galactus was unaffected by them darkseid sometimes uses the beams to punish those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright darkseid can teleport himself or others through time and space 44 his omega sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate

several hundred thousand years he is not invincible and has been killed on several occasions 50 darkseid is able to drain the life force of other godly beings to rejuvenate himself or return to his
