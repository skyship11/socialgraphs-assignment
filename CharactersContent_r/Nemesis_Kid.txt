planet myar and is an enemy of the legion of super heroes created by jim shooter nemesis kid first appeared in adventure comics 346 july 1966 1 contents 1 fictional character biography 2 powers and abilities 3 in other media 4 see also 5 references 6 external links fictional character biography edit in his first appearance hart druiter applied to the legion of super heroes to be a member along with princess projectra karate kid and ferro lad 2 he identified himself as a native of the planet myar the alchemy planet and claimed he had created a mystical potion that gave him his powers he was actually sent to infiltrate the legion of super heroes on behalf of the alien khunds when his deception was revealed he tried to frame karate kid as the traitor when that failed he fled 3 he later became a founding member of the legion of super villains under tarik the mute 4 when a later incarnation of the group invaded the planet orando under druiter s leadership nemesis kid engaged karate kid in single combat before the fight ended karate kid sacrificed himself to stop the legion of super villains plans dealing nemesis kid a final blow karate kid s widow queen projectra attacked nemesis kid using her power to generate illusions though he had adapted an immunity to her illusions projectra intimidated him with her noble fury over the death of her consort thus immobilizing him from counterattacking and or preventing him from concentrating to gain a new adaptation then she broke his neck executing him as her royal privilege as ruler of orando at least five years later nemesis kid was resurrected by mordru along with every other corpse in the 30th century as part of the sorcerer s scheme to take over the universe his reanimated corpse retained his powers but he was defeated and his body was incinerated presumably disposing of him for good in his original pre crisis appearances nemesis kid only suffered three defeats in single combat duo damsel defeated him since his power would not work on her two bodies 5 projectra intimidated him from using his power thus freeing her to execute him look into my eyes churl as a resurrected corpse he proved immune to projectra s illusions but she turned his strength against him and threw him into a fire incinerating his corpse nemesis kid did not appear in the reboot legion in the threeboot continuity he appeared in supergirl and the legion of superheroes 22 as a member of a group later identified as mekt ranzz s wanderers other than a talent for computer hacking possibly metahuman enhanced he displayed no super human abilities powers and abilities edit nemesis kid possessed the superhuman ability to spontaneously develop the powers appropriate to defeat any single opponent for the duration of the battle though against more than one opponent his powers would either work against only one target allow him to escape the situation via teleportation or fail to work at all in one recorded instance karate kid 1 he displayed the ability to choose adaptations but his choices were less than successful in all other cases his power somehow sensed what would be most effective against a given opponent and generated an adaptation automatically nemesis kid never manifested any but the most basic and direct power to counter an opponent thus against superboy or supergirl he would gain superior strength and resistance to damage rather than the ability to emit kryptonite radiation his power only provided abilities to beat a single opponent s skill set because of this he typically sought out the most powerful opponent whenever possible nemesis kid s powers were never shown to give him immunity to harm caused by an opponent which is why both superboy and karate kid could injure him and projectra was ultimately able to kill him his power simply seemed to assure that he would inevitably win a conflict against a single opponent it is not known what the upper limits of his powers were or if they could generate an adaptation powerful enough to match cosmic menaces such as the anti monitor the monarch imperiex or mordru while nemesis kid could adapt to defeat robots in the first issue brainiac 5 built a cell that could resist nemesis kid s adaptations he escaped it by adapting the power of time travel and traveling to a point in time when the cell wasn t built it was never shown if nemesis kid could adapt to defeat non sentient items such as automated weaponry firing upon him or adapt to an opponent in anything other than a physical contest despite his villainous nature he somehow passed the legion s customary and undepicted test of a candidate s good character which could indicate other forms of adaptation on at least one occasion nemesis kid displayed a profound fear response when he and his lsv partners were confronted by the heroic legion this allowed projectra to defeat him with a simple demonic illusion which reduced him to a fearful wreck nemesis kid was purportedly a skilled alchemist but he has never displayed any ability and or interest in creating other mystical potions so the claim may have been a cover story to disguise his power s true origin he has a passing knowledge of 30th century technology and a basic understanding of tactics and strategy in other media edit nemesis kid appeared in the legion of super heroes episode the karate kid voiced by keith ferguson unlike his original comic book incarnation this version was truly a hero and had the inherent ability to temporarily nullify anyone else s superpowers and was a member of a special unit of the science police the origin and extent of his abilities is not revealed he joined the legion and assisted in taking down grimbor the chainsman grimbor uses a weapon that he claims is inspired by nemesis kid s power and it appears to be identical in effect but whether there is some closer connection between the two is not revealed presumably there is an upper limit to his nullification ability as the legion have not used nemesis kid in subsequent anticipated encounters against imperiex see also edit one of us is a traitor references edit wells john 2014 american comic book chronicles 1965
