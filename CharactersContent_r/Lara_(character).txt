1939 where she was first named lora her first comic book appearance after being mentioned in the 1942 text novel the adventures of superman by george lowther where she was named lara for the first time was in more fun comics 101 in january february 1945 a 1948 retelling of superman s origin story 6 subsequently delved into detail about lara though her more familiar silver age aspects became more firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades after the establishment of dc s multiverse in the early 1960s the golden age version of superman s mother was stated as having been named lora and lived on the krypton of the earth two universe 7 8 the silver age lara meanwhile lived on the krypton of the earth one universe a definitive synopsis of the silver age lara s life summarizing the various stories revealing her history came in the 1979 miniseries the world of krypton not to be confused with the post crisis on infinite earths late 1980s comic special of the same name as summarized in the world of krypton and in various other stories lara was a promising astronaut in krypton s space program 1 however krypton s space program was soon permanently grounded after jax ur blew up one of krypton s inhabited moons 9 eventually lara met scientist jor el with the two having several adventures together before getting married 3 such as a time traveling lois lane attempting to seduce jor el after failing to marry their son in the future 10 some time later lara gave birth to the couple s only child kal el early in jor el and lara s marriage the couple are briefly watched by the guardians of the universe who note that lara or her husband would have made an excellent green lantern 11 lara and her husband jor el were shown to be practitioners of the kryptonian martial art of klurkor 12 when krypton was about to explode lara and jor el placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by jor el in most retellings jor el wanted lara to accompany their son to earth but lara refused saying their son would have a better chance of reaching earth without her extra weight 13 kal el s spaceship then took off leaving lara and jor el to perish modern age versions edit after the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths and john byrne s 1986 miniseries the man of steel rewrote superman s origins details about lara s background and character were changed 14 under byrne s version lara inhabited a cold emotionally sterile krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden lara s grandmother lady nara and seyg el jor el s father were the ones who arranged the union between them so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet s register of citizens when another kryptonian died a rare and untimely death jor el however was considered a throwback for actually expressing emotions toward his wife lara and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past kryptonian eras in this version of the mythos lara was a librarian and historian of high rank and thought it horrifying that kal el would be sent to a primitive planet such as earth in one story the adult kal now superman is transported to the past and encounters his parents moments before krypton s destruction lara is disgusted by what she sees and tells kal not to approach her finding him repellent even as she is ashamed of her feelings in the 2004 superman miniseries superman birthright lara along with krypton and jor el more or less again became their silver age versions though with updated touches in this version lara is treated as a fully equal partner to jor el in constructing kal el s spacecraft and in designing various key components in the 2009 series superman secret origin by geoff johns superman is first introduced to his birth mother in his teens by the spaceship that brought him to the earth as a baby she is introduced to kal el by a hologram of jor el as his mother this moment shocks

in the choices of their lives and who unlike the members of other guilds cannot change guilds lara became a member of her husband s science guild when she married him and was thereby granted all the freedoms granted to other science guild members a member of krypton s military guild describes this as being raised up the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline lara is a member of krypton s military forces one of the most talented students on the military academy lara is both a skilled fighter and a bright scientist lara appears in the krypton

is eventually freed by her son and accepted into the superman family though jor el didn t make it out superman uses a specific crystal that allows him to resurrect jor el for 24 hours that would allow the two to spend more time with each other when the family tries to stop brainiac the villain stops his assault and moves kandor when he discovers that lara is pregnant telling the group that their family isn t complete yet 16 lara gives birth in baltazar s super powers book where her time in the phantom zone has altered the baby s dna to look like brainiac 17 in the elseworlds series superman

intercepts joe chill s attempted mugging thus unknowingly preventing the creation of batman jor el s own actions further hindering the opportunity for mankind to develop its own heroes in the belief that his family are enough lara eventually rejects jor el s desire to micromanage humanity out of fear of earth being destroyed as krypton was relocating to her own estate of lara land where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using kryptonian technology to heal injuries however the manipulation of lex luthor allows him to turn her son bru el into a kryptonite powered superhuman who nearly kills jor el before lara takes the blast herself this attack also infecting her with a secret virus that kills her after a few days of exposure in superman adventures based on the animated series the story arc family reunion sees superman accidentally travel to a parallel universe where a single kryptonian city survived krypton s destruction with its natives including jor el and lara however after spending years drifting in space lara has become bitter and egotistical abducting the local superman and supergirl and brainwashing them into being dedicated kryptonian soldiers to the point that they are willing to conquer earth and enslave humanity to ensure krypton s survival when the prime superman arrives in this world he joins forces with jor el to force the kryptonian forces back to the city at which point jor el reveals that he intends to destroy the city so that the resulting explosion will send superman home when lara asks if he is really willing to destroy the remaining few hundred kryptonians to save all of earth jor el grimly observes that she has just answered her own question and triggers the self
