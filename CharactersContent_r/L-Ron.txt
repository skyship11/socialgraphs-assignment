first encountered batman it was batman who first revealed to francine that kirk had mutated himself into the feral man bat at one point batman had captured the man bat and tried to give him an antidote to his condition but the man bat fought him at every turn he even tried bringing francine to the batcave in the hopes that she could convince langstrom to take the antidote willingly kirk escaped however and when he next reunited with francine forced her to take the same bat gland extract that he had taken as proof of her love and devotion to him although francine was terrified she knew that somewhere within the man bat s insanity lay the soul of the man she loved francine took the serum and like kirk mutated into a creature with bat like qualities the two man bats decided to marry one another at their wedding they donned latex masks to disguise their features but batman interrupted the ceremony and exposed them in front of all their guests batman fought against francine and kirk and was finally able to defeat them by using the cathedral s bells to incapacitate them upon doing so batman administered his cure to both of them turning them back to normal a few months later the langstroms traveled to las vegas nevada to study a rare breed of vampire bat that had surfaced following underground nuclear tests in new mexico while examining one of the bats francine pricked her finger on a fang and the toxin activated the dormant man bat gene that still resided in her body she transformed into a monster once again but this time with more vampiric characteristics including enhanced strength in this iteration francine could only transform into a she bat during the nights of the full moon an uncontrollable savage francine began terrorizing the streets of las vegas biting victims upon the neck and drinking their blood when news of her rampage reached gotham city batman believed that it was kirk langstrom who had become the man bat he flew out to vegas and fought the she bat on the roof of a vegas casino after the initial fight batman deduced that his opponent was not kirk langstrom at all but francine finding kirk the two tracked francine to a cave where batman ensnared her with his batrope he then administered the same antidote he had used in the past and francine was once again cured this treatment did not last long however a year later a professor of medieval history from antioke university known as baron tyme used his sorcery to take control of francine turning her back into the she bat he had francine attack and kill a former colleague of his named professor raymond arthur kirk langstrom became the man bat again and used hypnosis to break baron tyme s hold over her kirk defeated tyme and the sorcerer apparently died in his tower chamber when the room caught on fire batman consulted with langstrom about his wife s condition and insisted that he give francine a full blood transfusion kirk brought francine to his home town of chicago where she lived with him at the lakeshore manor apartments he kept a steady vigil over her condition and fortunately for them both the blood transfusion appeared to have cured her the langstroms had two children rebecca and aaron while rebecca was a normal human excluding the times when her whole family was mutated into man bats aaron was born a mutant bat creature due to the serum in his parents systems she also served as the lead scientist for the outsiders to help them with their missions in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe francine langstrom is reimagined as a more villainous character in this new timeline she met kirk as a research assistant and supposedly loved him for his conviction in developing the man bat serum for curing deafness when kirk transformed into the man bat to help cure the city of the man bat epidemic she decided to bring kirk back so he could perfect the formula for its original purpose then she would take the formula herself and transform into the she bat with some reported deaths kirk began to think that he lacked control over the beast but he discovered that francine s man bat formula differentiated from his as the bat she used was a south american vampire bat it is revealed that francine only married kirk to ensure the company that he would complete the serum and then have him killed so she could inherit a large sum of money she developed her own serum after kirk turned into the man bat in order to keep her job kirk tried to help cure her but she preferred her new form and attacked kirk but ultimately refused to kill him kirk combined the two serums in order to become a stronger beast and defeat francine and francine mocked him by acknowledging that he could only beat her by becoming like her she is later charged for the murders that she committed as the she bat 20 she is later released from arkham by the penguin and sent to attack harley quinn demonstrating that she has much better control over her transformation than kirk does she injects the man bat formula into harley and her friend tony to turn them into man bats however harley ultimately regains control over herself after francine threatens harley s friends and defeats the she bat 21 francine langstrom in other media edit francine langstrom appears in media set in the dc animated universe voiced by meredith macrae introduced in batman

was saved hawkman convinced her to fight the avatar and it left her seeking another host 29 although now back to her human form she still craved the meteor s power as it was more addictive than any

lionel luthor smallville edit lillian portrayed by alisen down had a long and prolific role in the tv series smallville lillian came from a wealthy family how she met lionel is unclear but they were married sometime before the 1980s by all accounts lillian was a caring beautiful and sophisticated person as well as comments made by lex and lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality had ambitions of her own and often stood up to lionel eventually lillian began to wonder about the special projects that lionel had she searched for answers and found something called veritas however alexander saw her going through his father s briefcase so lillian asked him not to tell anyone when lionel found out he immediately blamed alexander and forced him to tell the truth when alexander did lillian insisted lionel explain what veritas was but lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again lillian felt angered and disgusted by alexander s betrayal sometime later lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life lionel hired a nurse named rachel dunleavy to assist her rachel and lionel subsequently had an affair resulting in the birth of lionel s illegitimate son lucas it is unclear whether lillian knew of the affair or the child lillian was helped by a nanny pamela jenkins who alexander regarded as a second mother lionel was often absent from home and lillian insisted that he take alexander on one of his business trips to smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 lionel s resulting shame and constant critique of alexander bothered lillian greatly sometime in the early 1990s lionel insisted that they have another child an idea that lillian was highly opposed to presumably because of her poor health however when alexander was 11 lillian became pregnant again she insisted that alexander be allowed to come home for school from excelsior academy and lionel complied her pregnancy was strenuous and lillian was bedridden for much of it on alexander s disastrous 12th birthday which no one attended lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of st george which he kept into adulthood and later gave to clark kent after baby julian s birth lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually one evening lionel sent the baby s nanny home and insisted that lillian bond with the child lillian expressed her concern that lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce a threat that she had apparently made many times and that lionel had called tiresome on returning home from work one night lionel discovered alexander in the baby s nursery alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing julian while trying to stop him from crying lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck alexander their relationship never recovered even after he became an adult it was not until years later after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories that he remembered that lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions hoping to spare him from lionel s maltreatment alexander took the blame correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife sometime before her death lillian along with lex and lionel went to a ranch in montana to spend time together during that time a snake spooked lillian s horse prompting lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better after julian s death lillian s health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when alexander was 13 he later confessed to clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her lex also told lana lang that he was away at boarding school when lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school lillian left her shares of luthorcorp to her son and pamela lillian s death was

showed lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from lionel and luthorcorp however at the end of the vision lana his dream wife suffered complications during childbirth because of lex s lack of resources and estrangement from his father he was unable to transfer lana to a better facility and she died this led lex to believe that lana died because he lacked enough money and power with these everything else in life could be secured as a result lex ignored his mother s warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption after realizing this lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son s choice when lex was injected with the limbo drug which placed its users in a state of clinical death he met lillian again who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice when lex was shot and went into a coma clark kent and lionel used a machine that allowed clark to enter lex s mind in order to find lois lane and kara kent in lex s mind clark met a young version of lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult lex in the memory featuring lillian snooping in lionel s briefcase clark witnessed lionel s verbal and physical abuse of both lex and lillian as well as watched lex try to help his mother up but lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away
