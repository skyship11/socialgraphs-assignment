atom which was cut from the body of an alien lifeform known as the silver shield after being captured by project atom this skin makes her nearly invulnerable and grants her a measure of superhuman strength enough to throw a car with ease and hurt wonder girl and other moderately powered super beings with a punch she can fly and fire blasts of energy bombshell can generate energy waves capable of scrambling the minds of others and can control electromagnetically powered technology like the electronic parts of cyborg bombshell s origin is different from captain atom s and major force s in that she was not exposed to a nuclear explosion in the course of acquiring her dilustel coating she was merely covered with the alien material thus there is no risk of a radiation hazard if her quantum metal skin is breached in fact damaging the metal coating beyond a certain point temporarily negates her powers teen titans 63 reveals that the metal had managed to bond to her body and she can bring forth a new coating whenever she wants to with all the powers of the original references edit teen titans vol 3 38 teen titans vol 3 40 teen titans vol 3 41 teen titans vol 3 43 teen titans
