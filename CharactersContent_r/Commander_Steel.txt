ross the relaunched justice society of america features another member of the heywood family during an interview with newsarama new series writer geoff johns announced him as a brand new character with new powers 27 he debuted in justice society of america 2 with the name of nathan buckeye heywood nathan is the grandson of henry heywood and cousin of henry heywood iii formerly a football star at the ohio state university nathan retired after shattering his kneecap and having his leg amputated due to an undiagnosed infection the incident left nathan addicted to painkillers while attending a heywood family reunion he is attacked by the fourth reich a team of metahuman neo nazis ordered by vandal savage to wipe out the bloodlines of golden age heroes the fourth reich fails to completely destroy the heywood bloodline as both nathan and a few children manage to survive both nathan s brother and mother are turned to metal statues by the villain reichsmark nathan jams his crutch into reichsmark s mouth causing him to spit liquid metal blood onto nathan hawkman takes him to dr mid nite who notes that the metal is being absorbed by nathan s skin nathan s brother and mother in their metal forms are moved to the rooftop of the jsa brownstone 28 later it is revealed that the metal has grown out from where nathan s amputated leg once was forming metallic bone muscles and flesh waking in his hospital room nathan is shown to have superhuman strength dr mid nite informs nathan that he is now a being of living steel due to an unknown reaction to reichsmark s blood however the steel tissues do not give nathan tactile response meaning he cannot feel textures or temperatures nor gauge exerted pressures and his weight has greatly increased causing his footsteps to crack the ground he is given a costume a second skin of a stainless steel alloy developed by dr mid nite and mr terrific specifically to restrict his movements and reduce his strength to a more manageable level they chose the costume s colors because of heywood s heritage he then joins the justice society to defeat the fourth reich 8 afterwards the press asks if he is the new commander steel nathan denies it saying that he is just an ordinary citizen so he is called citizen steel by power girl 29 when the third world survivor gog appears nathan is one of the jsa members who sides with him hoping that gog can restore his sense of touch the old god continually ignores his presence 30 it is later revealed that gog is rooting himself into the earth which would cause its destruction if he ever left and when the unconverted jsaers battle him they are blown away by winds created by gog nathan alone is able to withstand the winds gog offers nathan his greatest wishes fulfilled if he sides with him and worships him but nathan refuses and joins the fight against him for this act gog induces excruciating pain in nathan 31 nathan then tears off his suit and unleashes his full strength against gog actually managing to topple the giant which gives gog s former herald magog the chance to cut off his head and send him to the source wall 32 following gog s defeat nathan takes time off from the jsa to be with his family this consists of survivors of the attack on the reunion various children most of whom call him uncle nathan 33 or uncle nate 34 during the events of blackest night nathan helps fight off the hordes of black lanterns attacking manhattan he tries to help power girl during her battle with the newly reanimated kal l but is knocked aside by the hero who mockingly refers to him as a paperweight compared to him 35 following the split in the justice society nathan opted to join power girl s more youth oriented team of jsa all stars 36 powers and abilities edit originally commander steel could lift 1 000 pounds but when he appeared in the pages of the all star squadron he was attributed super human strength without an exact limit citizen steel s metallic body grants him superhuman strength and allows him to take direct blows from opponents as powerful as gog and remain standing and in turn knocking him to the ground the only one in the jsa able to do so but at the cost of reducing his sense of touch so that he cannot really feel anything he comes in contact with making it hard for him to judge how much effort he should put into doing things his alloy suit limits his strength to controllable levels but at a cost of slowing him down as well as making him so heavy that he has been shown cracking pavements just by walking upon removing his suit he is able to unleash his full strength without a speed penalty 37 other versions edit earth 2 edit in september 2011 dc comics cancelled and relaunched its entire line of monthly comics in an initiative called
