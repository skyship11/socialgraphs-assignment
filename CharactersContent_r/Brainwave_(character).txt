member of the team hawkman had ray palmer shrink and enter brainwave s body guided by dr mid nite palmer planned to operate on king s brain specifically the abnormal mass of nerve fibers leading from the auditory cortex to a growth on the side of the inferior colliculus the supposed source of brainwave s powers while a member of black adam s group brainwave acted both maliciously and in a calculating fashion seemingly being depicted as a supervillain again his telepathy is also portrayed at being at a high point as he is able to will the powerful captain marvel to turn back into young billy batson by forcing him to say shazam the source of these actions are found in hank s brain where palmer encounters mr mind a captain marvel villain who is feeding on brainwave s growth he finds it especially delicious unlike regular humans palmer eventually gets past the worm and successfully incapacitates brainwave he is taken back with the jsa and left in the care of his mother merry pemberton it is unknown when brainwave became a host for mr mind 7 later brainwave was recruited by doctor fate to save sand from the dreaming in that mental plane he was able to destroy sand s

and taking on a post crisis version of jonah hex henry and all of infinity inc took over for the justice society on a seemingly returned earth 2 henry king jr has been portrayed differently over his many appearances being heroic at first appearing as a villain secondly and with a third portrayal as a mixture of the two but largely heroic powers and abilities edit both king sr and jr have a variety of mental powers king sr was originally much stronger but upon his death he somehow passed his powers on to his son vastly increasing king jr s power level chief among their powers is telepathy both are able to dominate many minds at once and cause people to see illusions or even have complete control over them proximity seems key to the effectiveness of this power even though it had no defined range king jr mentioned how even strong wills could not resist him when he was right next to them while many telepaths filter out the thoughts of others king jr allows the millions of minds he constantly comes across to flow freely through his mind lesser used powers of the kings include telekinesis the creation of realistic three dimensional holograms and the ability to fire blasts of psionic energy other versions edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in the earth 2 series the earth 2 version of henry king jr was incarcerated at arkham base with todd
