s origins writer doug moench and artist don newton introduced harvey bullock in batman 361 july 1983 as a device to resolve the ongoing plotline with gotham city s corrupt mayor hamilton hill and subsequent who s who in the dc universe entries acknowledged this as the new bullock s first appearance 3 however in later years batman fans began pointing out that a lt bullock appeared in three panels of detective comics 441 1974 written by archie goodwin pencilled by howard chaykin and published almost a decade before moench admitted that he must have read this comic because he is an archie goodwin fan but denied that harvey bullock is the same character he argued that it is unlikely that he drew on goodwin s lt bullock even unconsciously since there are discrepancies of both personality and continuity between his character and goodwin s and he distinctly remembers taking the name bullock from guitarist hiram bullock 3 archie goodwin is legally harvey bullock s sole creator moench said he decided not to contest this because he did not want to make a case against goodwin s widow anne goodwin whom he considers a friend 3 following the conclusion of the hamilton hill storyline moench decided he enjoyed writing harvey bullock enough to keep him on as a supporting character which necessitated some softening of his original characterization as a corrupt cop 3 bullock was one of several batman supporting cast members swept out of the batman family of titles when denny o neil became the batman editor in 1986 but in 1987 writer paul kupperberg brought him into the vigilante cast kupperberg recalled harvey bullock was a character very much in my wheelhouse a wise cracking loudmouth with a brooklyn accent and a problem with authority although he wasn t originally intended to be a permanent member of the vigilante cast he was brought in for a guest shot as a character to help vigilante s handler harry stein grease the wheels in gotham city for them on whatever case they were on i had fun writing him and the interaction between harvey and harry stein another slob with his own way of doing things clicked i don t think they were using him much if at all in the batman books by then so we got permission from the bat office to have the character on semi permanent loan for vigilante and its successor title checkmate 3 fictional character biography edit prior to the 1985 1986 dc maxi series crisis on infinite earths bullock was a crooked police detective under instructions from gotham city s mayor hamilton hill to sabotage commissioner gordon s career 1 when he is formally re introduced in batman 361 july 1983 in the story entitled the most successful species written by doug moench and penciled by don newton his method of doing so was to pretend to be exceedingly clumsy thereby spoiling whatever gordon was trying to do seemingly accidentally after inadvertently giving gordon a heart attack however bullock turns over a new leaf 4 his character later develops into a well meaning cop who probably was exceedingly clumsy similar to the later animated version he also forms a close bond with robin based initially on their mutual love of old movies subsequent to this he is a bishop in the spy organization checkmate post crisis edit following the continuity changes brought about in most of dc s comics by crisis bullock is perhaps the most controversial police officer in the gotham city police department his colleagues in the major crimes unit swear up and down that he is a good cop despite his reputation for taking bribes 5 using excessive force and having ties to organized crime he is not without endearing qualities however including a fondness for doughnuts and a hidden sentimental streak he also has a brief relationship with a widow he meets at work 6 this new post crisis bullock was retconned as having been loyal to gordon from the start even before he is promoted to detective he stays by gordon during one of the joker s rampages saving his life eventually without batman s assistance bullock and gordon stop the joker from causing an explosion that would have leveled gotham city during the entire case bullock

events of batman the long halloween bullock and the group are then joined by crispus allen and together they take down a gathering of gotham s freaks such as the joker clayface and scarecrow 7 later bullock is partnered with renee montoya and they both become very loyal to each other for a time bullock works with the international spy agency checkmate 8 they confront threats ranging from
