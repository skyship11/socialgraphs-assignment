remember the explosion on the island and then nothing but darkness am i supposed to be dead elasti girl teen titans 32 march 2006 when writer artist john byrne revived the doom patrol in 2004 elasti girl was among the team members reintroduced as if none of the events in prior doom patrol continuity had ever happened this situation was explained as an after effect of superboy prime s pounding on the barrier to reality which created ripples that changed reality for several characters including the original doom patrol the patrol members retain no memories of their previous lives until superboy prime breaks the phantom zone barrier during his battle with the teen titans and their allies at that moment their minds discern visions of the previous doom patrols and rita remembers everything her husband her son and her own death rita is seen in issue 7 of the 2005 storyline infinite crisis as one of the many heroes defending the city of metropolis from the army calling themselves the secret society of super villains she personally battles the giant villain giganta rita makes a cameo in issue 50 of the 2006 07 series 52 she is seen on a monitoring screen fighting black adam next to the leaning tower of pisa infinite crisis ultimately retconned byrne s reboot out of continuity one year later edit following the one year later storyline the doom patrol changes considerably losing several members and gaining beast boy bumblebee and vox 9 the explanation for rita s resurrection is that chief salvaged a piece of elasti girl s skull and used his technology to regrow her entire body due to its malleable form consequently elasti girl is very docile and is reluctant to question the chief the chief hints that her malleable form hampers her thinking abilities leading to her lack of personal initiative which makes her dependent upon caulder a k a the chief as he observes her interaction with the chief robin suspects that the chief has brainwashed rita and the other patrol members rita s husband mento is under the control of his mento helmet and believes that his wife would never love him without it following their battle against the brotherhood the titans and the doom patrol witness the chief working to convince kid devil that he is a freak and that the titans actually dislike him this pushes the teams to confront the chief mento finally removes his helmet and pointedly tells the chief that he is no longer the leader of the patrol and if he ever again insults his wife and son he will use his powers to destroy the chief s intellect rita firmly stands behind her husband breaking out of the chief s control in the most recent doom patrol series rita changed her codename to elasti woman 10 it was revealed that when the chief regrew her he did so using protoplasm to eliminate weaknesses such as bones and internal organs and therefore rita is no longer human when she sleeps rita loses her human shape and reverts to a puddle of goo having to reshape herself when she wakes up every morning powers and abilities edit rita has the ability to expand and shrink her body her powers of expansion allow her to become as large as a skyscraper she has the ability to shrink to mere inches during one adventure she was exposed to a gas that caused her to reduce to a microscopic scale and enter a sub atomic universe that experience has not been repeated
