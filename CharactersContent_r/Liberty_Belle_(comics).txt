was libby lawrence 1 her powers of enhanced speed strength and stamina were linked to the ringing of the liberty bell in philadelphia early in her mystery woman career she had an arrangement with tom revere a guard at the liberty bell when she signaled him he would ring the bell for her and trigger her powers 2 in her later years after decades of super strength many began to theorize about the nature of her powers some believed the sonic vibrations of the bell triggered a metahuman gene some believed that it was mystical because libby is connected to the power of the spirit of america like the heroes uncle sam and general glory most of liberty belle s heroic exploits took place during the second world war and she was one of the founding members and later chairwoman of the all star squadron 3 in her public identity she was the famous radio columnist libby lawrence and therefore well known both in and out of costume during the war she married speedster johnny quick after the war

seven issues with the last being published in 1987 as he did with several other characters roy thomas took some liberties with liberty belle s golden age continuity by having her retroactively marry johnny quick in 1942 while all her golden age appearances throughout the 1940s depict her as a single woman with a semi romantic relationship with captain rick cannon of g2 army intelligence thomas also wrote a story depicting the death of tom revere in 1942 despite the fact that he was a supporting character from the golden age liberty belle stories most of which take place in 1943 and later
