live in western europe between aquaman and wonder woman before using nuclear weapons to end the war 9 in other media edit teen titans edit red star from the teen titans episode snowblind red star features prominently in the teen titans episode snowblind voiced by jason marsden he assists starfire during a mission in russia and quickly becomes a friend and ally to her and the titans the origin of red star s powers is explained via flashback as one nearly identical to that of marvel comics s captain america wherein a lowly yet patriotic citizen is recruited to a secret government project led by professor chang to be transformed into a supersoldier he is one of the few superheroes in the series to be acknowledged by his real name being addressed as captain kovar by raskov a former general suggested to be in charge of the program red star is granted superior strength stamina and the ability to generate radiation thanks to the government experiment he lacks control over his radiation which builds up in proportion to his emotional state for this reason red star has been living in voluntary exile in an abandoned siberian nuclear power plant where he uses the facilities to funnel his excess radiation into liquid capsules whenever the energy builds up too much a leakage in the containment unit made the radiation melt up the snow outside which seeped into a pond where it eventually created a plasma monster which wreaks havoc on the surrounding settlements acting out red star s latent resentments red star gets blamed for the creature s actions partly because of the destruction he had inadvertently caused when his powers went berserk the first time red star spends a lot of time with starfire during the episode encouraged by starfire to embrace his powers instead of fighting them back red star fights the creature and destroys it by pumping it full of an overdose of radioactive energy however this causes energy within his body to rise to uncontrollable levels leading him to ask starfire to take him into space where his power is released in a gigantic explosion before his departure the titans make red star an honorary member and his people who previously shunned and feared him now see him as a hero red star reappears alive in titans together along with starfire and bumblebee in the headquarters of the brotherhood of evil to help the titans fight the assembled supervillains how he survived the outburst of his energy is never explained though his newly acquired flight ability would allow him to return easily after the explosion he also acquired the ability to create fire from his hands like his comic book counterpart arrow edit main articles arrow tv series list of arrow episodes and list of arrow characters red star s father konstantin kovar is
