links development edit during an interview co creator john broome discussed the genesis for the idea i remember in the beginning we both got the feeling that it had something to do with king arthur and the knights of the round table we thought if we could make a modern version of that spirit and the feeling that would be a new kind of comic that hadn t been done and we would enjoy doing it so we worked out a third world war where life was almost destroyed and crime was all over and the atomic knights stand for justice and faith and all that so that is the way the story began 2 the original atomic knights edit the only atomic knights cover appearance in strange adventures 144 the giant dalmatians are also present on the cover the atomic knights appeared in every third issue of strange adventures in the early 1960s beginning with 117 june 1960 and running through 160 january 1964 3 in all there were 15 early 1960s atomic knights stories created by writer john broome and artist murphy anderson they were a band of heroes living in and protecting the post apocalyptic future of 1992 following the catastrophic hydrogen war of 1986 a petty tyrant named the black baron ruled a small section of the midwestern united states with an iron fist he was opposed by sgt gardner grayle and the atomic knights who wore medieval suits of armor that were impervious to the baron s energy weapons the armor having been irradiated in the war 4 the other knights were twins wayne and hollis hobard bryndon smith the last scientist left on earth and brother and sister douglas and marene herald the group became a symbol of hope to the survivors of the cataclysm 5 the atomic knights mid 70s incarnation the 15 atomic knights stories in strange adventures took place in real time three months usually passed between the events of each story as well as in the real world and generally dealt with post holocaust recovery as the knights would fend off menaces and attempt to rebuild the area around their home base of durvale though they also managed to travel to los angeles detroit new orleans new york and washington d c the atomic knights concept then lay dormant for more than a decade until cary bates used the knights as guest stars in the mid 1970s series hercules unbound beginning with 10 april may 1977 hercules kamandi and the atomic knights all inhabited the same comics
