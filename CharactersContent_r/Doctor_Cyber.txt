powers and abilities edit the first doctor cyber had no powers but wore an armored suit that allowed her to physically fight wonder woman on near equal terms the suit enhanced her strength and endurance and also allowed her to redirect energy when fired at the suit she also used a variety of weaponry that included laser pistols mind control serum an invisibility screen rocket sleds and myriad robot assassins after her disfigurement she often used plain and unattractive women as henchmen so as not to be reminded of her lost beauty the second doctor cyber also wore an armored suit but while its full abilities and limitations are as yet unknown in keeping with her name they are more implicitly cybernetic in nature as her limbs were able to stretch to impossible lengths it does seem that she is a cyborg and not merely a person in armor post rebirth doctor cyber developed a device that would enable her to remotely interface with mechanical components this automated robotics system could physically interface with the neurological mechanics of the brain from a world away but ran the risk of subsuming a human mind who piloted it in the virtual reality after her body died veronica
