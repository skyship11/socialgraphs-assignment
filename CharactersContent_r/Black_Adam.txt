strongly opinionated attitude despite this he has stated on many occasions that he respects the justice society particularly members such as jay garrick several other jsa members are shown to be skeptical of adam s reformation primary among them is the atom smasher who later becomes adam s close friend after adam sympathizes with his decision to kill the near immortal extant to save his mother the writers also created added tension in the book by having captain marvel who is wholly unconvinced that adam has reformed join the team one jsa story arc issues 39 through 44 features marvel hawkgirl and mr terrific venturing back in time to ancient egypt where they meet the mighty adam before his corruption during this visit the mighty adam is grateful to meet captain marvel since marvel

learning about the loss of adam s family adam rebuffs the offer commenting that marvel cannot truly understand him stating that while they are not enemies they will never be friends johns and goyer used this story arc to slightly alter adam s origin the hero now hails from the fictional north african nation of kahndaq not egypt although he serves the egyptian prince khufu who is later reincarnated as jsa member hawkman the character of blaze is completely removed from the origin story and adam s rage is described as having resulted from the conquering of kahndaq and the murder of

could have spared them his escape and the hassle of a trial by simply killing kobra when he was first captured adam then turns his attentions to his old homeland of kahndaq now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the united nations late 2003 began the publication of a jsa hawkman crossover story arc titled black reign written by geoff johns alone which features

protect his people and his nation although his arrogance is still a handicap when the spectre attacked kahndaq after being corrupted by eclipso black adam actually told his people that the jsa were
