brainstorming session with the editors and writers of superman comics in response to a concern by some writers that most of superman s foes at this point either relied on technology or their intellect to outmaneuver superman or had some natural advantage against him wanting to create a new foe with great physical power to match him several writers proposed having superman die at the hands of a bestial foe and editor mike carlin scribbled this idea on the wall chart as doomsday for superman inspired they chose doomsday as the name for this villain 4 doomsday had a cameo appearance in superman the man of steel 17 november 1992 and made his first full appearance in superman the man of steel 18 december 1992 5 fictional character biography edit doomsday is depicted as a monstrous genetically engineered being from the depths of prehistoric krypton his creator imbued him with few feelings mostly hate and desire for destruction which led to his destroying worlds and eventually finding earth where he met superman 6 the character is best known as superman s murderer in the 1992 storyline the death of superman the ultimate killing machine edit originally known as the ultimate doomsday was born in prehistoric times on krypton long before the humanoid kryptonian race gained dominance over the planet about 250 000 years ago it was at that time a violent hellish world where only the absolute strongest of creatures could survive 7 8 in a cruel experiment involving evolution intended to create the perfect living being the alien scientist bertron released a humanoid infant born in vitro in a lab onto the surface of the planet where he was promptly killed by the harsh environment the baby s remains were collected and used to clone a stronger version this process was repeated over and over for decades as a form of accelerated natural evolution the agony of these repeated deaths was recorded in his genes driving the creature insane and to hate all life doomsday in promotional artwork for dc comics t shirts art by dan jurgens and brett breeding as it evolved the child eventually became able to survive the high temperatures and searing atmosphere only to be quickly slain by the vicious predators that inhabited the planet over time and without the assistance of bertron s technology he gained the ability to thrive on solar energy without the need for food or air to return to life and adapt to overcome whatever had previously killed him the ultimate hunted and exterminated the dangerous predators of krypton he then killed bertron whom he had come to identify as an enemy 7 the ultimate escaped krypton via a ship that regularly arrived to deliver supplies to bertron who had wanted little contact with the planet s natives and went on a killing spree across several planets it began 245 000 years earlier on planet bylan 5 where apokoliptian prince uxas the future darkseid was about to wed a princess to obtain that planet s chemical deposits for apokolips s weapons factories the ultimate killed uxas ally master mayhem almost instantly and instilled great fear in uxas having watched their fight just as the ultimate and uxas were about to meet in combat uxas was forced to flee the ultimate s rampage had caused the planet s atmosphere to become toxic thereby rendering the chemicals worthless to apokolips the ultimate hitched a ride on an escaping shuttle which crashed on khundia the warring khundian clans united to build protective armor for a warrior named kobald who they hoped would survive long enough to force the ultimate onto a rocket once the rocket was in space the ultimate killed kobald and the resulting explosion sent him hurtling through space he next crossed paths with a green lantern named zharan pel beating him to death the ultimate took the lantern s power ring and sensing the power of the guardians of the universe headed towards them the thousands of green lanterns that were sent to stop him were slaughtered he continued to oa where a single guardian fought him wary of the others joining the fight fearing the ultimate would absorb their powers as he believed was happening to his powers he as a last resort sacrificed himself in battle to defeat him the release of energies by the guardian caused a tear in space through which the ultimate fell eventually arriving on the planet calaton he ravaged that world for three years 7 with only the capital city left the royal family combined their life forces into a single energy being the radiant 7 9 the radiant killed the ultimate with a huge blast of energy laying waste to over a fifth of his planet in the process in common calatonian burial procedures the ultimate s seemingly dead body was suited and shackled to prevent his spirit from escaping into the afterlife and he was shot into space because the murders he committed made him unworthy of burial on calaton eventually his metallic casket crashed on earth the force of the impact driving it deep underground 7 the death of superman edit main article the death of superman doomsday s first full appearance on the cover of superman the man of steel 18 december 1992 art by jon bogdanove and dennis janke after freeing one arm and breaking out of his buried vault the ultimate went on a rampage in midwestern america where he first encountered the justice league he defeated the entire team of superheroes in a matter of minutes which attracted the attention of superman 9 most notable is that the creature fought the whole time literally with one hand tied behind his back due to his ancient burial cables yet was still able to lay waste to all opposition and much of the surrounding area the only justice leaguer who could defend herself against the creature was maxima the creature gained its new name when league member booster gold remarked that the rampage resembled the arrival of doomsday the comment reached the broadcast media and led to the creature becoming known by its new name of doomsday five leaguers including superman combined their energy powers to take down doomsday but succeeded only in destroying the last of his burial cables allowing him to use both hands thus worsening the crisis during his rampage doomsday s interest was captured by billboards and television spots advertising violent wrestling competitions held in metropolis which appealed to his blood lust and enticed the otherwise mindless creature to head towards the city in counterattacking the creature superman found that his opponent s power was more than a match for his own and was getting stronger he realized that if doomsday actually reached metropolis the resulting battle could conceivably destroy the city and kill millions of innocent people doomsday developed a strong desire to murder superman a desire that was later explained in the hunter prey miniseries from the agony of continually dying during his creation process doomsday developed in his genes the ability to sense anyone kryptonian as well as an overriding instinct to treat any such being as an automatic threat in the space of a few issues of the superman comic book series doomsday battled superman in a titanic struggle leading the hero to conclude that the creature would continue to attack relentlessly and endlessly with no fear or compassion matters came to a head in superman vol 2 75 wherein both doomsday and superman beat each other to death in front of the daily planet building in metropolis 9 following the battle four super beings appeared and took up superman s mantle two of them declaring themselves to be the real superman one was a half man half machine who greatly resembled superman with cybernetic implants where superman had sustained the greatest amount of damage from doomsday s blows this superman took custody of doomsday s body after strapping the body to an asteroid with an electronic device attached the cyborg flung doomsday into deep space on a trajectory supposedly certain to never intersect any other planet the issue ended with a panel of a reawakened and laughing doomsday still chained to the asteroid but otherwise alive rematch hunter prey edit after passing through a wormhole doomsday s asteroid was found by a deep space scavenger ship upon examination of the peculiar looking drifting rock the ship s crew retrieved the object hoping to find something of value the scavenger vessel happened to be on a route to apokolips the home of the now powerful tyrant darkseid now empowered by the fabled omega force long after his first encounter with doomsday doomsday was fully rested and after slaughtering the crew of the salvage ship found himself landing on the harsh world this was to be the setup for a final showdown between doomsday and superman who had been uneasy about the possibility of doomsday s resurrection with the help of his justice league contacts superman procured a mother box a sentient computer after darkseid s servant desaad contacted earth about a problem on apokolips unknown to superman doomsday had faced and beaten darkseid in single combat even after withstanding the full effect of darkseid s omega beams and was laying waste to apokolips before superman could deal with doomsday desaad opened a boom tube to calaton the first world where doomsday was successfully defeated and sent doomsday through to what he believed was his defeat at the hands of the radiant doomsday was able to adapt however and overcome any opponent because of the process by which he was created so although the radiant had defeated him once he would not be able to defeat him again likewise even though superman had killed doomsday once before he was unable to do so again superman while knowing this having learned doomsday s history by the time manipulating waverider was obsessed with stopping doomsday and followed him to calaton he fought doomsday again with the help of the mother box but despite it providing him with extra weapons such as an ultrasonic gun and an energy sword superman met with defeat as doomsday s evolutions rendered him immune to superman s attacks such as his auditory channels being sealed by new bone growths or his knuckle bones being able to shoot out of his body to pin superman in the air eventually with his left arm having suffered a compound fracture and most of his weapons lost superman was forced to use one of waverider s time travel devices to leave doomsday stranded at the end of time where doomsday met the one force he could not overcome entropy upon returning superman to the present the mother box healed superman s injuries and then died on apokolips darkseid despite being beaten to near death by doomsday became fascinated with him after witnessing his abilities first hand and learning his origin from waverider the doomsday wars edit doomsday returned yet again in the miniseries the doomsday wars in this series prin vnok an underling of brainiac uses his technology to travel to the end of time to retrieve doomsday to combine the beast s massive power with brainiac s formidable intellect after brainiac s original body was badly injured in his last fight with superman this was explained as having taken place at the time of the timeline s reconstruction following the events of zero hour the reconstruction of time meant that brainiac was able to change the events of doomsday s defeat he was unable to erase doomsday s consciousness with drugs however because he reacted too fast for the process to work with doomsday s strength of will too strong for brainiac to permanently overwhelm him on his own brainiac instead chose to use a human host to genetically engineer a doomsday clone without the mind of the original while temporarily lodging in doomsday s head to use the creature s strength until he would be forced out he chose to use pete ross and lana lang s newborn baby born eight weeks premature and transported by superman to a hospital brainiac intercepted superman and stole the baby to hurt his long time foe correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to superman and feeling that the baby s still malleable dna would make him ideal for the plan in the end superman thwarted brainiac s plot by driving him out of doomsday s body via the use of a telepathy blocking psi blocker simultaneously rescuing the baby from brainiac s equipment after his foe s treatments brought the child to full term before infusing him with doomsday s dna he then lured doomsday to the moon where he placed him in a kind of stasis with four justice league teleporters perpetually transporting between those four booths doomsday would never be more than 25 integrated and was thus unable to escape our worlds at war edit following these events doomsday was released by manchester black s suicide squad to battle imperiex a threat judged to be greater than doomsday himself 9 once freed doomsday slaughtered the squad then went on to battle imperiex s numerous probes his mind having been altered by black to regard them as the threat he normally perceived superman to be which had thus far managed to seriously injure or kill most of earth s heroes doomsday tore through numerous probes with seemingly little effort while aided by superman the only time the two enemies would come close to teaming up before finally confronting imperiex imperiex proved too much for doomsday he blasted the creature reducing him to a glowing skeleton sentience edit superman vol 2 175 commemorated the 100th issue since the death of superman in battle with doomsday by staging a rematch doomsday s skeleton was retrieved and his flesh regrown by lex luthor using superman s kryptonian dna who gave doomsday to darkseid to repay earth s war debt to apokolips darkseid sought to control doomsday since their last encounter by this time doomsday had evolved intelligence and sentience luthor arranged for the joker to set doomsday loose in washington d c to demonstrate that he was in good working condition it also happened to be the anniversary of the day that superman had died while stopping doomsday despite being weakened by kryptonite exposure when luthor attempted to exploit doomsday s kryptonian origins superman s heart was restarted by black lightning and he reached doomsday just as the monster was struggling with the martian manhunter learning from j onzz that doomsday wanted to kill luthor because he blamed luthor for his death in the imperiex war superman would soon fight doomsday again and this time humbly defeat the creature by knocking him out and proving to himself and the world that doomsday would never again be superman s equal you re different now you can think for yourself so think about this before you were a mindless thing nothing could hurt you you couldn t feel pain much less understand it but once you have felt it it changes you forever and you ll begin to understand something new fear i ve lived with it all my life you don t want to die again do you the agony of what s happened to you affects your speed your strength and that little bit of doubt that you cannot win today grows you understand now don t you you will never hurt me again you will never kill me again never again darkseid attempted to replicate doomsday producing an army of doomsday clones darkseid was unable to duplicate perfectly the creature in all its raw power but still used the replicates as his foot soldiers typically for diversions or intimidations they were defeated by a combination of heat vision and batman s explosive batarangs during an attack on paradise island while darkseid kidnapped the newly arrived kara zor el supergirl 10 when superman traveled to apokolips to reclaim the life of steel mortalla darkseid s wife ordered his troops to release doomsday to help darkseid doomsday s short freedom was quickly halted by steel in the entropy aegis an armor with incredible power that had been built out of the remains of an imperiex probe 11 doomsday disappeared and was seen wandering the harsh lands of apokolips with his newfound intelligence doomsday managed to escape apokolips and return to earth upon his arrival doomsday encountered a series of emotions previously alien to him love compassion and kindness exploring the full range of these new emotions doomsday made his way to metropolis once more though not in the destructive manner he had before upon his arrival in metropolis doomsday found superman at the brink of death at the hands of gog and intervened to help superman in an ultimately futile fight against gog s army in a new future doomsday was remembered as one of earth s greatest heroes who continued superman s legacy by leading an army under his name against the army of gog this new timeline ended when it was revealed that superman was still alive trapped and tortured with kryptonite for two centuries by gog ultimately superman managed to convince gog of the error of his ways gog offered to correct the past by returning doomsday to an earlier point in the timeline but in the process doomsday would lose his intelligence and humanity returned to the present an unconscious doomsday was transported away by a younger version of gog to an unknown location for an unknown purpose infinite crisis edit during infinite crisis doomsday was freed from captivity in a cavern near the center of the earth by doctor psycho and warp doctor psycho mind controlled him and used him as the spear carrier of a super villain assault on metropolis 12 as he came into full view in front of green arrow he was stopped by kal el and kal l who made quick work of the villain as for the first time since the crisis on infinite earths the two supermen acted as a team 13 new krypton edit main article superman new krypton doomsday returned in the final page of superman 681 crashing in metropolis shortly after the representatives of kandor met with the president doomsday was then apparently killed on earth s moon when superman supergirl and many of kandor s inhabitants jumped him to death in action comics 871 crushing the monster s skull after the fight doomsday s mangled corpse ended up in the hands of general sam lane who was in charge of a mysterious government agency determined to halt the kryptonian invasion of earth it has been hinted at that general lane sent doomsday after the kandorians in the first place and the creature is only one of the weapons at lane s disposal general lane put lex luthor to work on apparently improving doomsday who by the end of new krypton had still not awoken from his most recent death during the fight zor el superman s uncle told him that doomsday was created by kryptonians on ancient krypton through forced evolution and as a result the creature hates all kryptonians reign of doomsday edit main article reign of doomsday doomsday returned to carve a new path of destruction throughout the dc universe his journey started in the steel one shot and continued into outsiders vol 4 37 justice league of america vol 2 55 superman batman annual 5 superboy vol 4 6 and into the milestone action comics 900 14 15 doomsday exhibiting an increased broadened power set which seemed to adapt to each of his opponents attacked defeated and abducted steel the cyborg superman the eradicator supergirl and superboy before taking them to a cloaked satellite at the former location of new krypton superman discovered that this was all part of a plot by lex luthor after locating the satellite superman attempted to free his allies only for them all to discover the apparently still inert body of doomsday as well as three separate clones each with a different power set 16 attempting to flee from the clones with doomsday the superman family discovered that their ship was on course for earth with the potential to trigger an extinction level event if it were to strike their attempt to divert the ship was interrupted by a being called doomslayer who resembled a cyborg version of doomsday and was later revealed to be a doomsday who was tossed down an infinite tube that gave it time to evolve doomslayer effortlessly tore eradicator apart and proclaimed that earth must die for the future 17 doomslayer believed the original doomsday to be an infection so it planned to destroy earth as it considered earth to be ground zero for doomsday s infection superman and his friends escaped the ship with the original doomsday and stopped the ship from crashing onto earth pushing it into metropolis s bay afterward doomslayer attacked the city with the doomsday clones determined to erase all trace and knowledge of doomsday from existence 18 the clones spread across the world wreaking havoc while doomslayer s second plan was to entice the doomsdays to reach the earth s core so that he could expand the universe inside the ship s tower and destroy the planet from within thus erasing all knowledge of doomsday from the universe in s t a r labs superman s allies used the original doomsday s body to try to find a way to stop the doomsday clones doomsday awakened but eradicator who was thought to be killed by doomslayer was in control as eradicator and the heroes attacked the doomsday clones he warned that doomsday s mind was beginning to awaken 19 in the final battle a weakened superman made contact with the ship s artificial intelligence before it reached earth s core hoping to have the tower teleport away meanwhile the doomsday clones were defeated by earth s heroes and sent back into the pit in which the tower was located eradicator arrived and defended superman now very weak from doomslayer quickly throwing superman out of the tower and allowing himself to be trapped with doomslayer before the tower teleported away 20 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe doomsday made his official debut in september 2013 as a part of villains month 21 in batman superman 3 1 doomsday attacked krypton many years ago when lara was a lieutenant in the elite military seminary colonel zod faced him wearing an ancient armor of krypton s warrior founders but their battle caused the death of thousands of kryptonians zod apparently defeated doomsday sending him to the phantom zone years later general zod now also imprisoned in the phantom zone communicated with the child kara zor el telling her how he admired the creature because it destroyed everything an attribute he sought for his people to be strong as years of complacency had made the kryptonians weak zor el narrated a prophecy in which the last knight of the house of el will travel to a distant planet after the destruction of krypton the last knight will be found by doomsday later and will battle him to save his people sacrificing his own life to do so 22 in superman wonder woman doomsday mysteriously appears in the north atlantic ocean and fights wonder woman breaking her arm before vanishing after describing her attacker to superman both travel to the fortress of solitude where diana identifies doomsday on a phantom zone viewing device superman assumes that the walls of the phantom zone are failing which has allowed the momentary escapes for doomsday months later the creature once again escapes the phantom zone to wreak havoc across the globe changing into an even deadlier form now every living thing in its vicinity dies and even physical structures crumble superman wonder woman steel and the justice league struggle to defeat it even calling on the aid of lex luthor in the end superman drags doomsday s body to the planet venus and incinerates it believing doomsday dead superman returns to earth only to watch in horror as the creature teleports there finally realizing he has no choice superman kills doomsday slicing the monster in half and as it disintegrates inhaling its ash like remains to contain them within his indestructible body however soon after he starts to change mentally showing signs of exacerbated stress and aggression and gradually physically as well resembling doomsday more and more it is revealed that doomsday was released by the phantom king xa du on instigation of brainiac the latter orchestrated it to get rid of superman as he prepared to assimilate the consciousnesses of all human beings in the world superman managed to take control of the raging power and fury of doomsday for long enough however to attack and defeat brainiac s gigantic mother ship dragging it into a black hole ridding himself of the doomsday infection in the process 23 dc rebirth edit in dc rebirth after the death of the new 52 superman the pre flashpoint superman appears to confront lex luthor as he attempts to proclaim his new role as metropolis s protector in the absence of the man of steel but their fight is interrupted when doomsday emerges from a coffin that was being transported by an unidentified group in a hovercar above them 24 as superman and lex attempt to fight the creature superman is troubled to realize that this doomsday operates at a strength level similar to the creature he faced for the first time in his world but also has some degree of strategic planning attacking passing trains and civilians to distract superman and luthor 25 as wonder woman appears to assist doomsday departs but superman and wonder woman are able to intercept him before he reaches superman s wife lois and their son jon 26 while wonder woman takes lois and jon to the jla watchtower for safety superman is confused when an unknown group appears and attacks doomsday 27 but they are swiftly defeated he subsequently manages to lure doomsday to his own makeshift fortress lois and jon plea to diana to help clark when he struggles in containing him and she soon joins the battle again this allows clark time to use the phantom zone projector to trap his foe but he is unaware that the unknown group led by mr oz intercepted the phantom zone beam and have captured doomsday for their own unknown purposes 28 after the merging of the timelines of both pre and post flashpoint superman in superman reborn doomsday had become smarter and escaped from his confinement when tim drake who had also been imprisoned by mr oz opened all the cells to escape tim drake from the titans tomorrow timeline who had also been imprisoned there came to his rescue and stunned doomsday several times with rounds of kryptonite ammunition unable to take him down he tricked him into re entering his cell by chasing a hologram of superman 29 powers and abilities edit doomsday developed in one of the harshest habitats in all of existence prehistoric krypton through cloning technology the infant continually returned to life and evolved becoming resistant or immune to whatever killed him before ultimately permanently acquiring the capability to regenerate and evolve without technology after the radiant killed him the first time they fought doomsday grew immune to the radiant s energy projection and even managed to withstand darkseid s full omega effect 1 the amount of damage dealt to doomsday determined the length of time it took for him to fully recover during his outwardly undamaged death at superman s hands he only needed some days to recover but when imperiex reduced him to a skeleton it took months his entombment in a calatonian burial suit and metal vault lasted hundreds of millennia after being killed by the radiant and subsequently undergoing the impact of the casket on earth his body was sealed underground in total darkness deprived of solar energy necessary to nourish his kryptonian anatomy he could only revive extremely slowly and naturally citation needed doomsday had a highly accelerated healing factor that allowed him to quickly regenerate from most damage when his side was cut by superman with a plasma sword it closed within moments as a result of his engineering doomsday did not need to eat drink breathe or sleep and his body was almost solid mass with no internal organs the masses of bone like material covering his body likely acting as some form of exoskeleton 1 resistance edit doomsday also was able to develop evolve resistance from ordinary injuries superman once used a sound gun to greatly discomfort him but doomsday s auditory canals closed up making him impervious to superman s weapon 1 waverider once paralyzed doomsday with energy while seeking to perceive doomsday s presence but the second attempt backfired as doomsday triggered a feedback burst that briefly disrupted waverider 1 in essence doomsday gradually became more invulnerable if not injured beyond his ability to recover which has so far been undefined doomsday developed weapons and abilities that countered the powers of an opponent he managed to cancel out the pure energy radiant by slamming into him while generating a dark counter energy to greatly extend his claws and develop a poison to strike superman in flight and reel him in 1 to breathe flames against the fire sensitive martian manhunter and apparently neutralize his defensive phase shifting power 30 doomsday s skeleton protruded through his skin in razor sharp spurs which provided protection to his few vital organs brain eyes and nervous system and acted as claw like weapons on his hands elbows and knees in addition the tips of these protrusions are lethally poisonous doomsday was immensely resistant to heat cold and conventional damage allowing him to survive in the most inhospitable worlds or in the vacuum of space his superhuman endurance and invulnerability were able to withstand darkseid s full powered omega effect without any apparent damage this is an immunity he shares with superman being as he is technically kryptonian 1 waverider s words suggest that doomsday s body could have been completely destroyed after his battle with the radiant suggesting that his healing factor has its limits but at this point doomsday was left so damaged that he remained comatose for several thousand years while trapped and cut off from the solar energy he required to sustain himself after his subsequent evolutions it is unlikely that anything is capable of doing sufficient damage to him to bring him to this state again 1 strength edit doomsday possessed enormous superhuman strength that is significantly greater than superman and at one point this enabled him to effortlessly stand his ground against the entire justice league including superman and orion 31 he was able to break superman s left arm with limited effort as well as outmatch and beat darkseid unconscious in combat 1 however his strength has limits the immensely strong calatonian alloy cables in which he was entombed continued to partially restrain him during his initial rampage on earth with the last of the cables only being destroyed when the justice league unleashed a full power assault to try and stop him it was never stated how long he had struggled to free his left hand before his escape doomsday possessed seemingly inexhaustible stamina and was not noticeably slowed down from fighting superman for an entire day his speed and agility were vastly disproportionate to his bulky stature and he was able to match superman in this regard once even managing to grab the flash while the hero was in motion he could not fly but traveled by leaping miles at a time superman took advantage of this in their first battle by trying to keep him airborne by flying into the sky after being regrown by lex luthor doomsday was genetically part kryptonian due to his genes having been spliced with kal el s however with the exception of his flame breath he displayed no additional abilities in fact he was shown to be weaker than previously when he was single handedly beaten by superman this was attributed to intelligence that he developed causing him to fear the death that awaited him if he lost but did not explain how a simple minor concussion could incapacitate his healing factor for the time he remained unconscious 30 he apparently lost his intelligence when he was sent back in time reverting him to his original state of fearlessness once he gained some of superman s kryptonian dna he became susceptible to kryptonite unlike superman it caused him pain but could not kill him this rendered him controllable but given his ability to adapt this may not be permanent it is unknown if he must first die and resurrect in order to gain immunity to something other powers edit during his confrontation with steel doomsday spontaneously developed the power of flight and the ability to cover his body with metallic armor capable of resisting even steel s paralyzing nanites 32 in a later confrontation with the outsiders as he sought to confront the eradicator he demonstrated the ability to absorb energy from looker and halo s attacks and send it back to them in a massive burst manipulating raw power like the eradicator 33 during his battle with the cyborg superman the cyborg tore through portions of doomsday s body which were quickly replaced with bionic parts of his own giving itself vast technopathy 34 when confronting superboy the monster showcased a blue glow in its eyes indicating tactile telekinesis power even greater than his own 35 but it has since been revealed that these doomsdays were actually clones of the original each specifically designed to take out steel henshaw eradicator and superboy putting them at a disadvantage when pitted against the other supermen 36 in the dcu revamp doomsday was revealed to grow and evolve in stages since its genesis growing as well as gaining in biomass and power over the course of its own development cycle it was soon revealed that when it killed superman post reboot it was only in its larval stage 37 while undergoing its adolescence phase the monster created a giant clump of its own biomass as a makeshift cocoon which steadily built up its physiological structure to its current state by feeding on the natural wildlife around it whence it hatched from its incubator doomsday became only that much greater an extinction level threat now able to move to and from the phantom zone at will using it as a hub for spontaneous teleportation 38 this was made possible due to its physical strength being vastly augmented to the point it could breach the dimensional barrier through physical force alone 39 he d grown so powerful in such a short amount of time that the creature could overpower the demigoddess diana of themyscira in a straight forward battle with ease going so far as to break both of her arms 40 doomsday was still in the stages of his evolution to help it along he developed a form of death aura which sapped the life out of anything and everything around him within a couple hundred yards 41 growing more and more powerful the more he killed and the more lifeforce he consumed an extension of this power was a toxic spore cloud he emitted from his own body which expedited the leeching process doomsday s deadly miasma had the effect of making everything around him wither and die at an accelerated rate such as sand glossing over into black onyx sentient life burst into flames several meters away even buildings spontaneously dissolving at a molecular level upon exposure to his poisonous fugue even a solar powered kryptonian couldn t stand to be in his presence for more than a few minutes at a time 42 the virulent also has the effect of turning anyone and everyone affected by it into an iteration of doomsday himself 43 moreover those who kill him become a receptacle for his essential self taking on his more vicious and bloodthirsty characteristics as well as his powers 44 other versions edit in the non continuity book all star superman grant morrison s modern take on the silver age includes the d n a p r o j e c t which is resurrected by a scientist named leo quintum under quintum s guidance the p r o j e c t was dedicated to the engineering of new human forms including bizarro worker drones giants called voyager titans who could travel through space under their own power and microscopic nanonauts who could unlock the mysteries of the sub atomic world the p r o j e c t s ultimate goal was to create a replacement superman in case something were to happen to the original in all star superman 4 it was revealed that the p r o j e c t with support from the u s army s cadmus division created a formula to bestow superman level strength and durability on a normal human but all of their test subjects ultimately burned out jimmy olsen shot himself with a syringe gun containing a formula marked do not open until doomsday and transformed into a hulking gray skinned figure with bony protrusions he succeeded in stopping a black kryptonite afflicted superman and transformed back into his normal form before the formula had a chance to kill him it is not discussed as to whether superman fought an original doomsday in this universe 45 during the lifeline storyline that ran in wonder woman an imperfect duplicate of doomsday was created by an artificial intelligence based on the son of scientist doctor julian lazarus 46 but was destroyed when wonder woman s allies were able to feed the clone so much power that its bones covered it and it reverted to a statue like state that she could shatter with relative ease 47 in an attempt to understand death mister mxyzptlk created a temporary copy of doomsday which he called bada bing bada boomsday although he erased it once again after it temporarily killed him this version had light yellow skin instead of the grey tinge of the mainstream version in addition to more spikes 48 in the tangent universe doomsday was a member of the doom patrol 49 in jla avengers 4 doomsday was shown in a panel near the end of the heroes battle against krona s enthralled army of villains where he was apparently defeated by thor 50 in the young justice crossover story world without young justice the past of all of the team members was changed superboy was now one of two clone attempts after superman s death his nemesis was a teenage

amanda waller was forced to contribute towards the repairs of smallville in return for her dealings in the aab project to remain secret 57 in the superman batman storyline mash up elements of doomsday

lying dormant in an underground vault project six s dna was used by the government s sam lane to create supersoldiers the volunteer supersoldier was neil sinclair 59 later project six controlled by general nathaniel adam via a mental interface was sent to attack booster gold who was believed to be an atlantean threat 60 during the battle adam s control device was disrupted by a metahuman woman named alexandra gianopoulos which caused project six s true personality to surface 61 project six attacked and nearly beat booster gold to death with booster only survived because project six was at a more basic level of evolution than the doomsday with which booster was familiar with the immediate threat defeated project six began to rampage killing innocent people but after regaining consciousness booster gold put project six s helmet back on returning control back to general adam however the general believing that project six was naturally mindless and incapable of doing anything without being under the control of something else attributed its rampage to booster commanding project six to capture him 62 when general adam attempted to have booster gold subjected to mind crippling interrogation due to his disbelief of booster s story booster gold shot down a girder knocking the control helmet off him at the same time an image of project superman appeared on a computer screen the two events caused project six s true personality to resurface again as project six rampaged badly beating booster gold alexandra put on the control helmet forcing him to rip open his own chest killing himself 63 doomsday prominently appeared in injustice gods among men prequel comic while entering a submarine looking for a captured lois lane superman encountered him he grabbed

off and superman watched in horror as lois perished along with their unborn son and metropolis exploded as a result of his actions this had a traumatic effect on superman causing him to have a new

antagonist 65 performed by dario delacio created as general zod s and faora s son from the strongest creatures dna on krypton this version had the human esque alter ego camouflage of paramedic davis bloome portrayed by sam witwer that mutated into the recognizable monster form and blacked out for the periods when doomsday was active and was portrayed as a tragic villain rather than a completely uncontrollable monster 66 a flashback in eternal revealed he was attached to clark s ship arriving as genetic material and met the luthors in 1989 befriending lex before sent to adoption as davis 67 when clark kent s secret is revealed to the world in infamous davis realized clark was the kryptonian he had been sent to kill at the time when doomsday went after chloe sullivan clark went back in time and altered history so davis never learned this 68 resulting in davis increasingly struggling to control his alter ego as he and clark discover their connection to each other in the season finale chloe sullivan splits davis and doomsday using black kryptonite and clark is able to trap doomsday deep below the earth while keeping davis alive believing davis could be saved however davis snaps anyway and kills jimmy olsen realizing that chloe had only been with him to protect clark and was still in love with jimmy before he could kill chloe jimmy pushes davis onto spikes impaling and killing him before jimmy succumbs to his own wounds ending the confrontation in a mutual kill 69 jimmy s death at davis s hands sends clark into a state of depression as clark chose to save davis rather than kill as originally stressed by colleagues until chloe manages to make clark see this error witwer s contract gave him the option to return in season 9 as general zod in the event the show was renewed though he considered his time on the show enjoyable and was flattered by the offer to stay on he ultimately passed on the role as he felt it would be difficult for both the characters and

course back to earth 72 doomsday was considered to make an appearance in superman the animated series but paul dini refused to include doomsday 73 doomsday appears in justice league in a better world doomsday arrives in metropolis via meteorite later revealed to be the remains of the rocket that was supposed to take him off world and begins attacking the city the justice lords having arrived from their dimension arrive to stop doomsday doomsday nearly defeats them but justice lord superman lobotomizes doomsday with his heat vision doomsday appears in justice league unlimited the episode the doomsday sanction revealed that cadmus extracted doomsday after being defeated and kept him prisoner after doomsday s brain had regenerated disgraced and enraged cadmus member dr achilles milo released doomsday to kill amanda waller after explaining that doomsday s hatred of superman was manufactured however doomsday killed milo instead and went to fight superman like his comic book counterpart his skull had adapted a heavy bone plate to prevent the same trick from working twice after a brutal fight doomsday is defeated when superman threw him into an active volcano encasing him in lava the justice league then tried to get some answers from the captured doomsday regarding cadmus which did not work as doomsday was unaffected by martian manhunter s telepathy superman then resorted to sending doomsday into the phantom zone since he s too dangerous to imprison anywhere else 74 doomsday also appeared briefly in the legion of super heroes animated series in the episode phantoms he is shown as a prisoner within the phantom zone along with many other phantom zone villains doomsday appeared in teen titans go making his first appearance in the great disaster in doomsday

director tim burton 75 doomsday in batman v superman dawn of justice doomsday is portrayed by elden henson in the 2011 short film the death and return of superman 76 77 robin atkin downes voices and provides motion capture for doomsday in the 2016 film batman v superman dawn of justice 78 and was assisted in voicing him by gary a hecker 72 after learning kryptonian information from the historical archives on a scout ship that crashed lex luthor uses general zod s body to create a kryptonian deformity an act which had been forbidden by the kryptonian council prior to the planet s destruction he finds out from the computer that this has been done before once by the council meaning that the real doomsday could still be out there luthor places the lifeless corpse into the genesis chamber and gives the creature life with his own blood in the climax of the film luthor sets the creature loose upon hatching from its egg sack to kill superman after batman declines to do so deeming the creature the man of steel s doomsday during the battle doomsday displays massive superhuman strength durability and stamina as well as the ability to evolve and regenerate at an incredibly fast pace growing bone protrusions and gaining more muscle mass in addition to being able to absorb energy and fire heat blasts from his eyes and mouth when superman flies the monster into space and the military fires a nuclear missile with the hopes of incinerating him doomsday survives and absorbs the nuclear energy gaining the ability to discharge electrical blasts from his body capable of levelling a few city blocks at once although wonder woman soon joins the battle doomsday s strength proves to be far greater than that of the two heroes combined however batman later surmises that because doomsday was created from kryptonian technology he shares superman s vulnerability to kryptonite lois retrieves the spear while wonder woman cuts off doomsday s right hand and holds him down using the lasso of truth and batman uses his last kryptonite round to weaken the monster doomsday is then killed when superman impales him with batman s kryptonite spear but not before the creature gets a chance to stab the hero with a new large bone protrusion from his severed wrist resulting in the demise of both characters superman was later resurrected in justice league in the same chamber used to create doomsday

that the real doomsday is alive and out in the universe 81 82 animation edit doomsday appears in the 2007 animated direct to video film superman doomsday doomsday s origin was simplified with a superman robot informing superman that kryptonian records reporting him as an improperly programmed doomsday biomechanical supersoldier a literal weapon of mass destruction or doomsday device one which could not determine friend from foe destroying everyone and everything in sight because it must after going on a killing spree it was engaged in battle by superman throughout metropolis doomsday was finally defeated when a severely wounded superman flew him into outer space then returned with him slamming him into the pavement and killing him the blast resulted in the mortal wounding of superman though superman s condition was discovered by the robot to be merely a deathlike reduced metabolic healing state unlike the comics there was nothing to indicate doomsday returned from the dead an army of doomsday clones appear in superman batman apocalypse they are created by darkseid and sent to attack themyscira however these clones are significantly weaker than the original doomsday after a lengthy battle the doomsday clones are all killed when superman uses his heat vision to incinerate them after the battle the heroes realize the clones were only used to distract them as darkseid killed lyla and kidnapped kara zor el doomsday appears in a two part animated film that serves as a more faithful re adaptation of the death of superman set in the animated movie continuity that began in justice league the flashpoint paradox and justice league war in the first part titled the death of superman meteorite holding doomsday emerged from a boom tube and crashes to earth while obliterating hank henshaw s shuttle doomsday whose containment suit is gradually destroyed goes on a killing rampage and overpowers most of the justice league while reaching metropolis when doomsday defeats wonder woman and nearly kills her with her own broken sword superman arrives and confronts the monster throughout the fight doomsday continually adapts and gains new abilities to combat his kryptonian opponent including gaining a flawed copy of superman s heat vision that is painful to use lex luthor jumps into the fray with a warsuit and attempts to destroy doomsday himself to gain the glory and get a sample of him for his cloning project but the beast destroys his suit and almost kills luthor until superman saves him and continues the fight the resulting long brawl takes its toll on superman s physical well being before lois s attempt to save superman provokes doomsday to execute her via a bone protrusion to which superman saves her by flying into doomsday hard enough to break the monster s neck but is skewered on the bone spike and dies of his injuries in lois arms by the end of the film doomsday s corpse is in custody of s t a r labs doomsday s exact fate is never established but reign of the supermen reveals that he is actually an apokoliptian biological weapon created by darkseid and sent to earth to kill superman before darkseid s next attack which was also the reason the meteor destroyed henshaw s shuttle as it came into earth orbit as darkseid was able to rebuild henshaw as a half robotic superman clone and brainwash him to serve as darkseid s agent in justice league dark apokolips war darkseid is shown to have an army of paradooms which are genetic hybrids of doomsday and the parademons which he had created to strengthen his army doomsday makes a
