intended to kill clark s friends and co workers kenny concluded that when they had competed as children clark had possessed all of the powers he possesses as superman and thus had cheated refusing to believe clark s insistence that his powers only fully developed when he was an adult seeing no other option superman attempted to forsake his identity as clark kent and go into hiding but kenny eventually tracked him down and knocked him unconscious 7 kenny then proceeded to place clark in a fake smallville set twenty years in the past filled with android versions of its citizens programmed to hate superman and regard kenny as a hero 8 several of them attacked superman including imitations of clark s parents jonathan and martha kent conduit also added an android of lois to the mix although this one was the same age as the real lois due to her not being part of the childhood kenny was trying to duplicate while superman dealt with that conduit waited for him at a duplication of the smallville high school football stadium where the two agreed to fight one on one without their powers making it just clark and kenny 9 kenny eventually resorted to using his powers and the hand to hand combat escalated to an all out brawl that heavily damaged the stadium in a desperate attempt to defeat clark kenny channeled electrical energy that was powering an audience of robots all of which were built in the image of kenny s father into himself as a result kenny overloaded and died his last words being to say that this is all clark s fault saddened by kenny s death superman returned
