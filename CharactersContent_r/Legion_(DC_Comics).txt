death he set out to kill his replacement hal jordan when he found jordan his ring was depleted thus leading legion to believe he had lost the trail in a rage he destroyed everywhere the ring had been jordan took the opportunity to go to abin sur s spaceship to recharge his ring which again attracted legion jordan detonated the ships reactors using his ring to protect himself and afterwards believed legion to be dead 3 however legion had escaped to the moon to continue his vendetta when jordan was taken to be trained by kilowog legion went to oa for a final assault on the guardians he easily broke through their defenses and jordan and kilowog were forced to assist in oa s defense nothing seemed able to stop him and many lanterns were killed he reached the guardian s citadel but jordan thinking quickly covered him with mud so his ring could affect him and shattered his armor believing this would kill him instead its consciousness absorbed the power of oa and grew to immense proportions 2 the guardians fled oa but jordan stayed to confront legion he hurled himself into the central power battery gaining immense power and was able to hurl legion into space where the other green lanterns took him back to tchk tchk to hopefully begin a new life 4 legion made no further appearances following the series and has been retconned out of dc comics continuity following the
