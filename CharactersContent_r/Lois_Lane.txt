lois lane back in the 1930s our heroine was of course a working girl whose priority was grabbing scoops what inspired me in the creation was glenda farrell the movie star who portrayed torchy blane a gutsy beautiful headline hunting reporter in a series of exciting motion pictures because the name of the actress lola lane who also played torchy appealed to me i called my character lois lane strangely the characterization of lois is amazingly like the real life personality of my lovely wife 4 an early sketch of lois lane by joe shuster modeled on joanne carter artist joe shuster based lois physical appearance on a model named joanne carter carter had placed an ad in the cleveland plain dealer newspaper in the situation wanted column advertising herself as a model 5 shuster corresponded with her and hired her as the model for lois lane shuster s depiction of lois was modeled on her hairstyle and facial features to me she was lois lane she was a great inspiration for me

shuster for lois lane carter said in the 1983 nemo magazine interview joe was redrawing the strip and it was going to be more realistic rather than cartoony i used to model for him every saturday

battled criminals and often defeated them using her quick wits and considerable skill in the kryptonian martial art of klurkor taught to her by kryptonian survivors in the bottle city of kandor 32 there were several cameos of the new gods including desaad and darkseid lois lane was the backup series in the daring new adventures of supergirl in 1982 to 1983 33 during the silver and bronze age lois backstory became more fully fleshed out with various stories explaining her life before becoming employed at the daily planet this backstory was attributed to the lois lane of earth one 34 as summarized in various stories lois was born to sam and ella lane and grew up on their farm in the small town of pittsdale 8 at the age of two lois suffered measles and at the age of three whooping cough 35 at an unspecified time during lois childhood her younger sister lucy lane was born 35 while lois was a toddler she encountered a rattlesnake in the woods near the lane family farm the snake was scared away by one of kal el s baby toys which had landed nearby in one of jor el s experimental rockets 36 during lois adolescence she won a youth contest run by the daily planet with the prize being a trip to metropolis to spend a week working as a cub reporter for the newspaper there she first met clark kent of smallville who was the other winner of the contest lois found clark dull and became more interested in asking him for information about superboy after learning clark came from smallville during the week in metropolis lois made a bet with clark to see who would get the most scoops which turned out to be lois as clark was forced to constantly go into action as superboy lois met superboy for the first time while uncovering a criminal enterprise for one of her stories at the end of the week clark paid off lois bet an ice cream sundae and the two returned to their respective hometowns 37 lois would meet superboy but not clark kent again during her adolescence while attending an all girls summer camp near smallville there lois met lana lang a fellow camper for the first time 38 lois would make further attempts at landing a job with the daily planet during her teenage years 39 and spent time writing for her hometown s newspaper the pittsdale star 8 upon finishing high school lois left pittsdale and attended raleigh college to study journalism while in college lois worked for the student newspaper the raleigh review as a reporter and eventually its co editor 40 after graduating from college lois became permanently employed at the daily planet clark kent and jimmy olsen later joined the planet s staff but lois remained the newspaper s star reporter 41 winning the pulitzer prize 42 she was very dependent on superman however he told her that having to rescue her so often from problems she caused prevented him from helping others 43 for example when late for a deadline lois jumped off a cliff expecting superman to catch her as he has done a thousand times and fly her to her destination 44 when asked on a sunday morning talk show what she would do if trapped in an underground mine with rescue impossible before the air ran out lois admitted that she would impatiently await superman because i ve got a deadline to meet 45 eventually lois realized that she had wasted a good part of her career by staying in metropolis for superman s sake and left 46 as both a journalist and as a woman she had to get on with her life 47 after the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths writer john byrne revised the superman legend and eliminated the silver age version of lois from continuity before this happened a final non canonical imaginary story whatever happened to the man of tomorrow was written by alan moore meant as a send off for the pre crisis versions of the characters including lois published at the same time but in earth one continuity was a two issue miniseries lois lane in which she investigates missing children 48 49 modern age edit lois lane as she appears on the cover of the man of steel 2 october 1986 art by john byrne lois underwent a character alteration beginning with john byrne s the man of steel miniseries which significantly rewrote superman s origin and history in this modern version of events lois was portrayed as a tough as nails reporter who rarely needed rescuing she was depicted as strong opinionated yet sensitive lois first real relationship in this version was with jose delgado who she later discovered acted as a vigilante josé s legs are shattered in a battle with a lexcorp cyborg human hybrid gone amok delgado eventually recovered he and lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated due to delgado accepting help from a lexcorp subsidiary arl 50 51 another major change made was that lois did not fall in love with just superman although she was attracted to him one reason was the revised nature of the superman clark kent relationship in the original silver age stories superman had been the man who disguised himself as clark kent in this newly revised concept it was clark kent who lived a life in which his activity as superman was decidedly secondary lois initially resented the rookie clark kent getting the story on superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview this sometimes ill tempered rivalry remained the case until the adventures of superman 460 463 and action comics 650 following clark s brief rampage under the influence of the eradicator lois was hesitant to forgive clark for selling out to collin thornton and running newstime magazine but forgave him in a span of mere minutes when he returned to ask for his job back clark elected to repay lois by finally letting go of his self imposed inhibitions and passionately kissed her the two became a couple and eventually lois accepted a proposal of marriage 12 13 clark shortly after revealed to her that he was superman 52 53 dc comics had planned on lois and clark being married in 1993 s superman vol 2 75 with the then upcoming television show lois clark the new adventures of superman dc decided they did not want to have the two married in the comics and not married on tv partially as a result of this superman was killed in superman 75 instead dying in lois arms after a battle royal with the monster doomsday after a period of time superman returned to life and both he and lois resumed their relationship though not without a few problems such as a brief reappearance of clark s former college girlfriend the mermaid lori lemaris lois eventually decided to take an overseas assignment to assert her independence and not be dependent on clark who had begun to overprotect her when clark became convinced lois was in danger he and her father sam allied to aid her secretly when lois returned to metropolis she had been through several life threatening exploits and was slightly amused when clark informed her his powers had been depleted and that he was her editor due to perry white s cancer upon discovering clark still had her wedding ring within a handkerchief lois warmly broke down teasing clark and finally agreeing to become his wife lois and clark were finally married in the comic book superman the wedding album december 1996 which featured the work of nearly every living artist who had ever worked on superman 15 the issue was published during the week of october 6 1996 coinciding with an episode of the television series lois clark the new adventures of superman which featured the wedding of the two characters 54 55 the wedding album itself spent part of its opening pages accommodating and reconciling the then current comic storyline of lois and clark having broken off their engagement since their marriage clark and lois continue to be one of the strongest relationships in comics in 2006 the couple took the next step in adopting a newly arrived kryptonian boy who they named chris kent the boy is later discovered to be the son of jor el s foe general zod although initially uneasy about raising a super powered child lois has shown immense aptitude of being
