mother arcane reveals that when she was a baby she already had power over the rot and she accidentally killed her by filling her with the rot to make him talk abigail lets him feel rot but she now says he will never escape his hell and will never touch rot again arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him he became stronger than he had been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and alec holland as she teleports away arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal on earth a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten he throws it away and arcane s eye appears in it 9 in swamp thing vol 5 36 when the swamp thing goes in the rot to warn abigail about the new realm of machines she initially assumes that he is there because of arcane who has escaped 10 it is eventually shown that he has returned to earth but since he is not the avatar of the rot he can only gain strength from consuming rotten items like corpses and garbage and as such is terribly weakened he joins forces with the new realm of metal which promises him the power that he lost and his power does grow greatly in this time he later poisons the green from within when the swamp thing is weakened in an attempt to destroy it but this fails when all the avatars of the green are awakened and use their power to cleanse the green to its original state abigail challenges arcane in the final war against metal and while she has the upper hand arcane eventually escapes in futures end it is revealed that five years in the future a series of events conspired to ensure that all avatars swore to stay off of earth and within their own realms to prevent chaos arcane only agreed to this if he was allowed to bind himself to abigail forever as seen when his left hand and her right are completely fused in a twisted embrace and when he calls her his daughter wife in doing so he allowed himself to leech off her power as the true avatar of the rot and ensuring that the swamp thing could not fight him without risking harm or death to the one he loved however the swamp thing has made the decision to destroy the rot using the power of a life through a white lantern ring arcane attempts to dissuade him by citing the necessity of death and rot but the swamp thing counters it by saying that fungi the grey and bacteria the divided have already decided to take over the role of rot while metal will keep them in check arcane then tries to give up abigail but the swamp thing believes that there is enough life in her to let her survive and in the worst case death is better than the hell that she lives in arcane briefly tries to fight back but abigail makes her move to distract him long enough for the swamp thing to activate the white lantern ring and bringing about the death of anton arcane powers and abilities edit anton arcane possesses the knowledge of creating synthetic organs and skin from those he made his un men with arcane initially wants to build

manipulate rot death and decay to his will especially within living beings when the swamp thing and animal man are trapped inside the rot arcane use this living rot on everyone except those who have a strong enough connection to the red animals or the green plants such as poison ivy or the man bat there are certain ways to prevent the living rot such as using the man bat serum if before being
