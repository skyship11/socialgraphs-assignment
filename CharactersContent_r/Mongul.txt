also decides to rename the yellow lanterns as the mongul corps after himself 30 soon after sinestro is brought to korugar and confronts mongul first using an override built into mongul s rings sinestro defeats him thus reclaiming the sinestro corps then he imprisons mongul in the corps central power battery intending to kill him once the black lantern corps is dealt with 31 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe mongul is once again reintroduced as lord and master of the planetary siege engine warworld in his introduction he is laying waste to a planet he is poised to conquer as he brought a resisting general aboard his vessel in order to show him the devastation of his homeworld just before killing him and adding his remains to a trophy room on warworld 32 mongul makes a brief appearance in the superman doomed story arc he manages to escape the phantom zone alongside similarly powerful villains such as non and prepares to attack earth upon learning that brainiac has arrived on earth mongul stricken with fear immediately heads back into the phantom zone 33 wonder woman later enters the phantom zone and traps him in her lasso of truth before ordering mongul s warworld to attack brainiac s ship sometime after his imprisonment mongul would escape the phantom zone with warworld in tow eventually setting his sights on revenge against sinestro and his fear corps for prior injuries long past by seeking to lure him out using black mercies on korugarian refugees then draining his ring to uselessness through leftover technologies of the old universal survivor relic which he had integrated into warworld s systems 34 mongul would use him as a bargaining chip to call the rest of his corpsmen to do battle over warworld to rescue their leader so he could cow them back into his services again while seeking to coax the emotional entity parallax from within his hated rival out into the open all to truly take command of the sinestro corps once again 35 his plan was going without a hitch so far even with the untimely arrival of bekka of the new gods lending much needed assistance but the tables were turned when the apex league a team of mercenaries whom he had enlisted eventually turned on him at sinestro s suggestion after mongul s prisoner reversed the energy siphon afterwards he would entrap his assailant in scrap metal lined with yellow ring fragments before jettisoning him into deep space a bright and shiny lure the pale vicors would be drawn to the interstellar warlord would resurface as an enslaved thrall of the pailing when his new masters attacked the earth at their lord marshal s clarion call now in the service of anti emotion mongul had returned to battle sinestro more powerful than ever while aiding in the subjugation of humanity 36 the battle would rage and sinestro would recruit many amongst the planet into his corps to defend it eventually black adam yet another addition to the yellow lanterns would cast him out of the fight just long enough for his brother in arms to deliver the killing blow to mongul and the pailing s leader the pale bishop 37 in the aftermath of the battle sinestro ceded control of his corps to his daughter soranik due to his injuries while the sinestro corpsmen helped earth rebuild mongul would stir from his zombified state hellbent on getting sinestro for feeding him to the pail vicors seeing as he was surrounded by manhunters however he opted a hasty retreat to earth in order to bide his time instead 38 dc rebirth edit mongul appears as a main villain in trinity where his use of the green causes poison ivy to capture superman batman and wonder woman and causes them to undergo hallucinations of their own childhoods the three are eventually able to reduce mongul s influence over his other world mongul is briefly a member of a new version of the superman revenge squad also consisting of general zod metallo cyborg superman eradicator and blanque after superman is temporarily blinded they are defeated when lex luthor supergirl superwoman kong kenan and steel come to superman s aid and zod betrays the rest of the team for his own ends 39 mongul later escapes prison 40 and somehow traps the justice league inside of an intergalactic arena around the time they are investigating barbatos 41 they construct a mecha out of mongul s creatures and frighten him away but upon returning to earth discover that it has been sacked by barbatos powers and abilities edit during the bronze age of comic books mongul was stronger than superman and almost totally invulnerable to harm 6 7 superman defeated him by foiling his schemes but only once defeated mongul in hand to hand combat even then superman fell unconscious immediately afterward 7 mongul also demonstrated the ability to teleport 6 limited telepathy and telekinesis 7 and could project blasts of potent force via his eyes 5 hands 6 or chest the character also used technology to shrink his enemies and place them in dimensional inversion cubes designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within 7 the modern age mongul started off with less power than the bronze age version but was still a formidable foe and a capable match up against superman on multiple occasions although slightly weaker mongul was able to resist half power kryptonian heat vision at point blank range and thanks to his enhanced musculature was incredibly resilient to physical harm because of his impressive muscle structure mongul was also incredibly fast and able to push himself forward at high speed while running or able to leap several miles into the air by his powerful legs he also had his chest cannon with which he could fire potent energy blasts that could stagger or kill even superman so formidable a foe was he that mongul could not only trade blows with kryptonians but repeatedly battle green lanterns on a regular basis especially given that his natural yellow skin gave him protection against their rings he was still outclassed though by individuals of greater capability be it physical or technological in nature such as hank henshaw before and after his acquisition of superman s genetic template and the demon neron who killed him with his bare hands his progeny mongul ii however showed himself to either be on equal footing or in greater strength than even his father having demonstrated enough might for defeating dc universe heavy hitters like wonder woman infinite crisis 1 december 2005 along with killing members of both the green lantern and sinestro corps in his pursuit of power rings he was strong enough to kill his sister mongal in one blow 14 when acquiring his first yellow lantern ring he decided to learn about its potential for 96 hours hinting at a methodical mindset mostly absent from yellow lanterns mongul ii also battled superman leading to his defeat after both delivered many blows leading to superman unleashing a massive combination attack required to overpower this villain superman vol 2 152 january 2000 this battle displayed him having an endurance to massive blows from a being as powerful as superman after having obtained several qwardian power rings he showed a rather avid usage of their power for numerous effects i e having used them along with his father s innate knowledge of the black mercy to modify the plant s parasitic behavioral patterns inducing frightful mirages over happy fantasies create and manipulate fear driven constructs powerful enough to batter an ion empowered sodom yat and reattach destroyed or removed limbs or body parts via precise fear energy material rearrangement in the new universe mongul has been radically re imagined from being the formidable adversary he once was during the bronze silver ages now back in control over warworld he again started cutting a bloody swath across the universe conquering planet after planet with his cosmic dreadnaught when he makes his way to earth he showcases extreme levels of super strength and resilience as he gets into a colossal battle between superman and an empowered batman who at the time had kryptonian like power sets 42 kal el once stated him to be about as strong as darkseid this is proven true in a number of cases where he showed his might by fighting off an entire brigade of yellow lanterns backed by a new god within their ranks 35 he still retains his chest cannon which can still blow away multiple personages in one blast as well as heat vision to incinerate his enemies 34 this new mongul is tougher faster and more powerful than ever easily able to take on individuals or groups as powerful as lantern corpsmen or even new gods as well as survive virtually unscathed in the event that he does suffer from critical abrasion mongul also has a slight healing factor with which to help him recover almost from anything the limits of which were never probed 43 he even showcased the natural capacity of flight with or without assisted propulsion more than once 38 for a time he was also part of the sinestro corps having access to all that it entailed i e the ability to create fear based energy constructs gaining power from the fears of others and acquiring a power battery with which to recharge his ring 35 after he had been deposed by sinestro who later requisitioned warworld for his own cause mongul would end up in the services of the pale vicors an anti emotional sect which razed planets of their resources and their inhabitants by nullifying their ability to feel and or empathize before harvesting the targeted worlds resources 44 having been given enormous power at the cost of his own individual freedom the pailing made mongul stronger beyond imagining with all new powers and abilities which allowed him to match and overpower the likes of sinestro and a yellow ring empowered black adam with ease he could even singlehandedly stalemate the very firepower of warworld itself which had been commandeered at the time by the sinestro corpsman ranx 45 as a pail vicor mongul possessed all the natural powers which came with it armed with his lance he could emit a form of apathetic force which negated the powers of the emotional spectrum giving him similar construct forming abilities akin to a lantern ring only angled to use other sentient beings emotional anguish to drive the emotion out of them rendering the afflicted unfeeling empty shells of who and or what they used to be he could also use its power to fly and emit energy blasts with the same energy negating effects as the protective aura which shrouds all the pailing 37 in other media edit television edit mongul in batman the brave and the bold mongul appears in the animated
