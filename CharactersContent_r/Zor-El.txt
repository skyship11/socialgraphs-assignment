city into kryptonite but zor el and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead the kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years and kara was born a short time after the destruction of krypton the end for argo city came when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation zor el managed to build a rocket and use it to send his daughter kara to earth fearing that superman would not recognize her because he had left krypton as an infant kara s parents provided a costume based closely on the man of steel s own it was later revealed to supergirl through zor el induced dreams that her parents had teleported away into the survival zone similar to the phantom zone during argo s final moments supergirl was able to rescue them in action comics 310 march 1964 and zor el and alura went on to live in kandor when the bottle city was enlarged zor el and alura resettled on new krypton rokyn earth two edit in

birthright and infinite crisis timelines edit zor el birthright timeline version as he appears in supergirl vol 5 5 march 2006 dc comics art by ian churchill in the supergirl from krypton story arc in superman batman 8 13 may october 2004 zor el rocketed his daughter away from krypton before kal el left it was expected that she would reach earth first and could help raise kal from his infancy however she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach earth until years later so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens after lex luthor uses black kryptonite to split kara into good and evil parts the evil kara claims that zor el actually sent his daughter to earth to kill his nephew since he was resentful of his older brother and hated the idea of jor el s lineage continuing past krypton s destruction regardless of the truth or falseness of this kara has rejected this aspect of herself in the new supergirl series new information on zor el s history and relations are crucial with zor el was featured in issue 16 as he appeared as an apparition and explained what truly happened to kara and why she was sent to earth to kill kal el in a dream sequence zor el was against the use of the phantom zone as a prison because he felt that it would become abused since no blood was shed it became a clean way to deal with criminals in the argo city area he lived in he was a very trusted scientist like his brother jor el and was working at this time on sunstones krypton s crystalline technology he fought with jor el over the use of the phantom zone and tried to stop him from supporting it zor el began to see that each time someone went in something was also coming out in the form of phantoms these phantoms possessed people creating anarchy on krypton zor el discovered he could stop them using his sunstones although the bodies of the possessed would be destroyed however zor el was not believed and began to be seen as a dangerous crank this tied together and explained fragmented flashbacks that had suggested zor el was a villainous character including his dismissal of schoolchildren taunting kara as the dead they had already been possessed and alura telling kara to kill her and make your father proud she had also been possessed and this was not a taunt but a genuine request from what remained of her original personality as well as the original idea that he wanted kara to kill kal el as the story ended it was revealed that the house of el was cursed by the phantoms as they saw them as their jailers wherever one of the el blood line went the phantoms would follow to save earth he needed to send kara to remove kal and stop the el blood line from ever growing at the end of this story arc however it was revealed that the images of zor el and the phantoms subsequently invading earth as predicted were all a ruse by the monitors to see if supergirl belonged in the new earth universe upon discovering she was truly that universe s supergirl she was left to her own devices to reconcile with all the people she harmed in the wake of the test the monitor does however assert that the memories of zor el and the phantoms on krypton were nevertheless real new krypton edit a subsequent flashback in 24 apparently contradicts the monitor revealing that new earth zor el was not a scientist although alura was in current continuity zor el was a ranger and got on well with his brother with his encouragement alura designed the ship that sent kara to earth as both kal el s protector and the last living being who remembered krypton since kal el was an infant nothing further has been revealed about the real new earth zor el as yet in action comics 869 it is revealed the zor el saved argo city from krypton s destruction by engineering a protective dome with his wife alura however brainiac who was the culprit for krypton s explosion returned to finish the job he merged argo with the bottle city of kandor and killed those he considered to be duplicate information superman finds the city in brainiac s ship zor el and alura are able to make contact with kal el to enquire about their daughter he was later murdered by reactron 3 in supergirl vol 5 43 zor el is described as a noted member of krypton s artist guild and kara as sharing his creative impulse in blackest night crossover while kara and alura are visiting zor el s tomb discussing the situation with earth zor el is reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps ready to attack his wife and daughter the scientists of new krypton manage to place a forcefield composed of a counter energy to the black ring s power source around the planet cutting off zor el s right hand and preventing him from continuing his attack 4 the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline supergirl discovers an amnesiac cyborg superman living on the planet i noxia this turns out to be zor el who was rescued from krypton s destruction by brainiac and reconfigured as a half man half machine to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe 5 his backstory is that in spite of his jealousy and resentment zor el listened when jor el claimed krypton was doomed using brainiac based technology he built a dome around argo city and a space rocket to send kara to earth just in case argo s force field failed he did not warn his wife and daughter about his plans though minutes before the explosion he put his daughter to sleep laid her on a space pod and blasted her into space an action for which his wife nonfatally shot him before realizing that he was correct about the fate of krypton argo city outlived krypton but not for long without a way to sustain themselves the cities seven million inhabitants died off zor el sent a distress signal but less than a dozen people remained alive when brainiac found the city brainiac turned zor el into a cyborg erased his memory and reprogrammed him to serve him still zor el was not a compliant servant he was obsessed with achieving perfection and getting his lost memories back the new zor el met and fought supergirl who gave him the cyborg superman moniker several times 6 7 zor el eventually rebelled against brainiac he was soundly defeated and left for dead still his systems rebooted restoring his memory in the process zor el was appalled at what he had become and what he had done and became obsessed with bringing argo city back and recreating krypton convincing himself it was for his daughter s sake 8 unfortunately his chosen method demanded the sacrifice of earth people s lives forcing supergirl to stop him after defeating him kara told her father he could have looked for another way to save argo and she would have helped him but he never wanted that still she was not willing to give up on her father so zor el was taken to dr veritas s lab and was placed inside a pod as dr veritas went about removing his cybernetic components and reconstructing his body using tychotech s technology his daughter still visited him unwilling to give up on her father but zor el pretended to sleep and never talked back it was not until indigo nearly killed supergirl that he acted by tearing indigo into pieces although he was only saving his daughter s life the national city s townsfolk felt his actions confirmed supergirl was protecting a murderer only because he was her father zor el was captured by the d e o taken to a clandestine base and locked up there he was visited by mister oz who gave him what he
