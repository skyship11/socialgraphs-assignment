deadman could not be seen or heard by most others certain mystics could still perceive him was able to pass through objects and could fly or float he was able to possess any living being human or animal control their actions and could communicate with people through another s body furthermore the possession process is nearly instant in transition enabling deadman to possess different bodies in rapid succession for tactical advantage in combat in one storyline however he could not control certain criminal henchmen he possessed due to their minds being under post hypnotic suggestion since

upon its wielder these powers so far include flight invisibility or the ability to cloak his presence teleportation healing severe wounds making solid energy constructs and the power to bring beings
