attending glenville high school in cleveland and bonded over their admiration of fiction siegel aspired to become a writer and shuster aspired to become an illustrator siegel wrote amateur science fiction stories which he self published as a magazine called science fiction the advance guard of future civilization his friend shuster often provided illustrations for his work 3 in january 1933 siegel published a short story in his magazine titled the reign of the superman the titular character is a homeless man named bill dunn who is tricked by an evil scientist into consuming an experimental drug the drug gives dunn the powers of mind reading mind control and clairvoyance he uses these powers maliciously for profit and amusement but then the drug wears off leaving him a powerless vagrant again shuster provided illustrations depicting dunn as a bald man 4 the reign of the superman a short story by jerry siegel january 1933 siegel and shuster shifted to making comic strips with a focus on adventure and comedy they wanted to become syndicated newspaper strip authors so they showed their ideas to various newspaper editors however the newspaper editors told them that their ideas were insufficiently sensational if they wanted to make a successful comic strip it had to be something more sensational than anything else on the market this prompted siegel to revisit superman as a comic strip character 5 6 siegel modified superman s powers to make him even more sensational like bill dunn the second prototype of superman is given powers against his will by an unscrupulous scientist but instead of psychic abilities he acquires superhuman strength and bullet proof skin 7 8 additionally this new superman was a crime fighting hero instead of a villain because siegel noted that comic strips with heroic protagonists tended to be more successful 9 in later years siegel once recalled that this superman wore a bat like cape in some panels but typically he and shuster agreed there was no costume yet and there is none apparent in the surviving artwork 10 11 siegel and shuster showed this second concept of superman to consolidated book publishers based in chicago 12 a in may 1933 consolidated had published a proto comic book titled detective dan secret operative 48 13 it contained all original stories as opposed to reprints of newspaper strips which was a novelty at the time 14 siegel and shuster put together a comic book in a similar format called the superman a delegation from consolidated visited cleveland that summer on a business trip and siegel and shuster took the opportunity to present their work in person 15 16 although consolidated expressed interest they later pulled out of the comics business without ever offering a book deal because the sales of detective dan were disappointing 17 18 cover of an unpublished comic book 1933 siegel believed publishers kept rejecting them because he and shuster were young and unknown so he looked for an established artist to replace shuster 19 when siegel told shuster what he was doing shuster reacted by burning their rejected superman comic sparing only the cover they continued collaborating on other projects but for the time being shuster was through with superman 20 siegel wrote to numerous artists 19 the first response came in july 1933 from leo o mealia who drew the fu manchu strip for the bell syndicate 21 22 in the script that siegel sent to o mealia superman s origin story changes he is a scientist adventurer from the far future when humanity has naturally evolved superpowers just before the earth explodes he escapes in a time machine to the modern era whereupon he immediately begins using his superpowers to fight crime 23 o mealia produced a few strips and showed them to his newspaper syndicate but they were rejected o mealia did not send to siegel any copies of his strips and they have been lost 24 in june 1934 siegel found another partner an artist in chicago named russell keaton 25 26 keaton drew the buck rogers and skyroads comic strips in the script that siegel sent keaton in june superman s origin story further evolved in the distant future when earth is on the verge of exploding due to giant cataclysms the last surviving man sends his three year old son back in time to the year 1935 the time machine appears on a road where it is discovered by motorists sam and molly kent they leave the boy in an orphanage but the staff struggle to control him because he has superhuman strength and impenetrable skin the kents adopt the boy and name him clark and teach him that he must use his fantastic natural gifts for the benefit of humanity in november siegel sent keaton an extension of his script an adventure where superman foils a conspiracy to kidnap a star football player the extended script mentions that clark puts on a special uniform when assuming the identity of superman but it is not described 27 keaton produced two weeks worth of strips based on siegel s script in november keaton showed his strips to a newspaper syndicate but they too were rejected and he abandoned the project 28 29 siegel and shuster reconciled and resumed developing superman together the character became an alien from the planet krypton shuster designed the now familiar costume tights with an s on the chest over shorts and a cape 30 31 32 they made clark kent a journalist who pretends to be timid and conceived his colleague lois lane who is attracted to the bold and mighty superman but does not realize that he and kent are the same person 33 concept art c 1934 1935 note the laced sandals based on those of strongmen and classical heroes 34 in june 1935 siegel and shuster finally found work with national allied publications a comic magazine publishing company in new york owned by malcolm wheeler nicholson 35 wheeler nicholson published two of their strips in new fun comics 6 1935 henri duval and doctor occult 36 siegel and shuster also showed him superman and asked him to market superman to the newspapers on their behalf 37 in october wheeler nicholson offered to publish superman in one of his own magazines 38 siegel and shuster refused his offer because wheeler nicholson had demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible businessman he had been slow to respond to their letters and hadn t paid them for their work in new fun comics 6 they chose to keep marketing superman to newspaper syndicates themselves 39 40 despite the erratic pay siegel and shuster kept working for wheeler nicholson because he was the only publisher who was buying their work and over the years they produced other adventure strips for his magazines 41 wheeler nicholson s financial difficulties continued to mount in 1936 he formed a joint corporation with harry donenfeld and jack liebowitz called detective comics inc in order to release his third magazine which was titled detective comics siegel and shuster produced stories for detective comics too such as slam bradley wheeler nicholson fell into deep debt to donenfeld and liebowitz and in early january 1938 donenfeld and liebowitz petitioned wheeler nicholson s company into bankruptcy and seized it 3 42 in early december 1937 siegel visited liebowitz in new york and liebowitz asked siegel to produce some comics for an upcoming comic anthology magazine called action comics 43 44 siegel proposed some new stories but not superman siegel and shuster were at the time negotiating a deal with the mcclure newspaper syndicate for superman in early january 1938 siegel had a three way telephone conversation with liebowitz and an employee of mcclure named max gaines gaines informed siegel that mcclure had rejected superman and asked if he could forward their superman strips to liebowitz so that liebowitz could consider them for action comics siegel agreed 45 liebowitz and his colleagues were impressed by the strips and they asked siegel and shuster to develop the strips into 13 pages for action comics 46 having grown tired of rejections siegel and shuster accepted the offer at least now they would see superman published 47 48 siegel and shuster submitted their work in late february and were paid 130 equivalent to 2 503 in 2021 for their work 10 per page 49 in early march they signed a contract at liebowitz s request in which they gave away the copyright for superman to detective comics inc this was normal practice in the business and siegel and shuster had given away the copyrights to their previous works as well 50 see the copyright issues section of this article for more details on this matter the duo s revised version of superman appeared in the first issue of action comics which was published on april 18 1938 the issue was a huge success thanks to superman s feature 1 51 52 influences siegel and shuster read pulp science fiction and adventure magazines and many stories featured characters with fantastical abilities such as telepathy clairvoyance and superhuman strength one character in particular was john carter of mars from the novels by edgar rice burroughs john carter is a human who is transported to mars where the lower gravity makes him stronger than the natives and allows him to leap great distances 53 54 another influence was philip wylie s 1930 novel gladiator featuring a protagonist named hugo danner who had similar powers 55 56 superman s stance and devil may care attitude were influenced by the characters of douglas fairbanks who starred in adventure films such as the mark of zorro and robin hood 57 the name of superman s home city metropolis was taken from the 1927 film of the same name 58 popeye cartoons were also an influence 58 the name clark kent was created by taking the first names of actors clark gable and kent taylor clark was also inspired by explorer william clark especially when coming up with the names lois and clark a nod to meriwether lewis and william clark american explorers who discovered the pacific ocean douglas fairbanks left and harold lloyd right influenced the look of superman and clark kent respectively clark kent s harmless facade and dual identity were inspired by the protagonists of such movies as don diego de la vega in the mark of zorro and sir percy blakeney in the scarlet pimpernel siegel thought this would make for interesting dramatic contrast and good humor 59 60 another inspiration was slapstick comedian harold lloyd the archetypal lloyd character was a mild mannered man who finds himself abused by bullies but later in the story snaps and fights back furiously 61 kent is a journalist because siegel often imagined himself becoming one after leaving school the love triangle between lois lane clark and superman was inspired by siegel s own awkwardness with girls 62 the pair collected comic strips in their youth with a favorite being winsor mccay s fantastical little nemo 58 shuster remarked on the artists which played an important part in the development of his own style alex raymond and burne hogarth were my idols also milt caniff hal foster and roy crane 58 shuster taught himself to draw by tracing over the art in the strips and magazines they collected 3 as a boy shuster was interested in fitness culture 63 and a fan of strongmen such as siegmund breitbart and joseph greenstein he collected fitness magazines and manuals and used their photographs as visual references for his art 3 the visual design of superman came from multiple influences the tight fitting suit and shorts were inspired by the costumes of wrestlers boxers and strongmen in early concept art shuster gave superman laced sandals like those of strongmen and classical heroes but these were eventually changed to red boots 34 the costumes of douglas fairbanks were also an influence 64 the emblem on his chest was inspired by heraldic crests 65 many pulp action heroes such as swashbucklers wore capes superman s face was based on johnny weissmuller with touches derived from the comic strip character dick tracy and from the work of cartoonist roy crane 66 the word superman was commonly used in the 1920s and 1930s to describe men of great ability most often athletes and politicians 67 it occasionally appeared in pulp fiction stories as well such as the superman of dr jukes 68 it is unclear whether siegel and shuster were influenced by friedrich nietzsche s concept of the übermensch they never acknowledged as much 69 comics see also publication history of superman and superman franchise comic books see also list of superman comics the cover of superman 6 sept 1940 by joe shuster the original artist and co creator since 1938 superman stories have been regularly published in periodical comic books published by dc comics the first and oldest of these is action comics which began in april 1938 1 action comics was initially an anthology magazine but it eventually became dedicated to superman stories the second oldest periodical is superman which began in june 1939 action comics and superman have been published without interruption ignoring changes to the title and numbering scheme 71 72 a number of other shorter lived superman periodicals have been published over the years 73 superman is part of the dc universe which is a shared setting of superhero characters owned by dc comics and consequently he frequently appears in stories alongside the likes of batman wonder woman and others superman has sold more comic books over his publication history than any other american superhero character 74 exact sales figures for the early decades of superman comic books are hard to find because like most publishers at the time dc comics concealed this data from its competitors and thereby the general public as well but given the general market trends at the time sales of action comics and superman probably peaked in the mid 1940s and thereafter steadily declined 75 sales data first became public in 1960 and showed that superman was the best selling comic book character of the 1960s and 1970s 2 76 77 sales rose again starting in 1987 superman 75 nov 1992 sold over 23 million copies 78 making it the best selling issue of a comic book of all time thanks to a media sensation over the supposedly permanent death of the character in that issue 79 sales declined from that point on in march 2018 action comics sold just 51 534 copies although such low figures are normal for superhero comic books in general for comparison amazing spider man 797 sold only 128 189 copies 80 the comic books are today considered a niche aspect of the superman franchise due to low readership 81 though they remain influential as creative engines for the movies and television shows comic book stories can be produced quickly and cheaply and are thus an ideal medium for experimentation 82 whereas comic books in the 1950s were read by children since the 1990s the average reader has been an adult 83 a major reason for this shift was dc comics decision in the 1970s to sell its comic books to specialty stores instead of traditional magazine retailers supermarkets newsstands etc a model called direct distribution this made comic books less accessible to children 84 newspaper strips see also superman comic strip beginning in january 1939 a superman daily comic strip appeared in newspapers syndicated through the mcclure syndicate a color sunday version was added that november jerry siegel wrote most of the strips until he was conscripted in 1943 the sunday strips had a narrative continuity separate from the daily strips possibly because siegel had to delegate the sunday strips to ghostwriters 85 by 1941 the newspaper strips had an estimated readership of 20 million 86 joe shuster drew the early strips then passed the job to wayne boring 87 from 1949 to 1956 the newspaper strips were drawn by win mortimer 88 the strip ended in may 1966 but was revived from 1977 to 1983 to coincide with a series of movies released by warner bros 89 editors initially siegel was allowed to write superman more or less as he saw fit because nobody had anticipated the success and rapid expansion of the franchise 90 91 but soon siegel and shuster s work was put under careful oversight for fear of trouble with censors 92 siegel was forced to tone down the violence and social crusading that characterized his early stories 93 editor whitney ellsworth hired in 1940 dictated that superman not kill 94 sexuality was banned and colorfully outlandish villains such as ultra humanite and toyman were thought to be less nightmarish for young readers 95 mort weisinger was the editor on superman comics from 1941 to 1970 his tenure briefly interrupted by military service siegel and his fellow writers had developed the character with little thought of building a coherent mythology but as the number of superman titles and the pool of writers grew weisinger demanded a more disciplined approach 96 weisinger assigned story ideas and the logic of superman s powers his origin the locales and his relationships with his growing cast of supporting characters were carefully planned elements such as bizarro his cousin supergirl the phantom zone the fortress of solitude alternate varieties of kryptonite robot doppelgangers and krypto were introduced during this era the complicated universe built under weisinger was beguiling to devoted readers but alienating to casuals 97 weisinger favored lighthearted stories over serious drama and avoided sensitive subjects such as the vietnam war and the american civil rights movement because he feared his right wing views would alienate his left leaning writers and readers 98 weisinger also introduced letters columns in 1958 to encourage feedback and build intimacy with readers 99 weisinger retired in 1970 and julius schwartz took over by his own admission weisinger had grown out of touch with newer readers 100 schwartz updated superman by making clark kent a television anchor and he retired overused plot elements such as kryptonite and robot doppelgangers 101 schwartz also scaled superman s powers down to a level closer to siegel s original these changes would eventually be reversed by later writers schwartz allowed stories with serious drama such as for the man who has everything superman annual 11 in which the villain mongul torments superman with an illusion of happy family life on a living krypton schwartz retired from dc comics in 1986 and was succeeded by mike carlin as an editor on superman comics his retirement coincided with dc comics decision to reboot the dc universe with the companywide crossover storyline crisis on infinite earths writer john byrne rewrote the superman mythos again reducing superman s powers which writers had slowly re strengthened and revised many supporting characters such as making lex luthor a billionaire industrialist rather than a mad scientist and making supergirl an artificial shapeshifting organism because dc wanted superman to be the sole surviving kryptonian carlin was promoted to executive editor for the dc universe books in 1996 a position he held until 2002 k c carlson took his place as editor of the superman comics aesthetic style in the earlier decades of superman comics artists were expected to conform to a certain house style 102 joe shuster defined the aesthetic style of superman in the 1940s after shuster left national wayne boring succeeded him as the principal artist on superman comic books 103 he redrew superman taller and more detailed 104 around 1955 curt swan in turn succeeded boring 105 the 1980s saw a boom in the diversity of comic book art and now there is no single house style in superman comics 106 in other media main article superman franchise

popular perception the 130 that dc comics paid them was for their first superman story not the copyright to the character that they gave away for free this was normal practice in the comic magazine industry and they had done the same with their previous published works slam bradley doctor occult etc 50 but superman became far more popular and valuable than they anticipated and they much regretted giving him away 134 dc comics retained siegel and shuster and they were paid well because they were popular with the readers 135 between 1938 and 1947 dc comics paid them together at least

exchange for signing the rights over to his production company pacific pictures both groups accepted the siegel heirs called off their deal with dc comics and in 2004 sued dc for the rights to superman and superboy in 2008 the judge ruled in favor of the siegels dc comics appealed the decision and the appeals court ruled in favor of dc arguing that the october 2001 letter was binding in 2003 the shuster heirs served a termination notice for shuster s grant of his half of the copyright to superman dc comics sued the shuster heirs in 2010 and the court ruled in dc s favor on the grounds that the 1992 agreement with the shuster heirs barred them from terminating the grant 141 under current us copyright law superman is due to enter the public domain in 2033 145 c however this will only apply at first to the character as he is depicted in action comics 1 which was published in 1938 versions of him with later developments such as his power of heat vision may persist under

marvel had many similarities to superman herculean strength invulnerability the ability to fly a cape a secret identity and a job as a journalist dc comics filed a lawsuit against fawcett comics for copyright infringement citation needed the trial began in march 1948 after seven years of discovery the judge ruled that fawcett had indeed infringed on superman however the judge also found that the copyright notices that appeared with the superman newspaper strips did not meet the technical standards of the copyright act of 1909 and were therefore invalid furthermore since the newspaper strips carried stories adapted from action comics the judge ruled that dc comics had effectively abandoned the copyright to the action comics stories and superman and therefore forfeited its right to sue fawcett for copyright infringement 141 dc comics appealed this decision the appeals court ruled that unintentional mistakes in the copyright notices of the newspaper strips did not invalidate the copyrights furthermore fawcett knew that dc comics never intended to abandon the copyrights and therefore fawcett s infringement was not an innocent misunderstanding and therefore fawcett owed damages to dc comics d the appeals court remanded the case back to the lower court to determine how much fawcett owed in damages 141 at that point fawcett comics decided to settle out of court with dc comics fawcett paid dc comics 400 000 equivalent to 4 051 244 in 2021 and agreed to stop publishing captain marvel the last captain marvel story from fawcett comics was published in september 1953 147 dc comics licensed captain marvel in 1972 and published crossover stories with superman by 1991 dc comics had purchased fawcett comics and with it the full rights to captain marvel dc eventually renamed the character shazam to prevent disputes with marvel comics who had created a character of their own named captain marvel back when the fawcett character had lingered in limbo 148 character overview this section details the most consistent elements of the superman narrative in the myriad stories published since 1938 superman himself in action comics 1 1938 superman is born on an alien world to a technologically advanced species that resembles humans shortly after he is born his planet is destroyed in a natural cataclysm but superman s scientist father foresaw the calamity and saves his baby son by sending him to earth in a small spaceship the ship is too small to carry anyone else so superman s parents stay behind and die the earliest newspaper strips name the planet krypton the baby kal l and his biological parents jor l and lora 149 their names were changed to jor el and lara in a 1942 spinoff novel by george lowther 150 the ship lands in the american countryside where the baby is discovered by the kents a farming couple the kents name the boy clark and raise him in a farming community a 1947 episode of the radio serial places this unnamed community in iowa 151 it is named smallville in superboy 2 june 1949 the 1978 superman movie placed it in kansas as have most superman stories since 152 new adventures of superboy 22 oct 1981 places it in maryland in action comics 1 and most stories published before 1986 superman s powers begin developing in infancy from 1944 to 1986 dc comics regularly published stories of superman s childhood and adolescent adventures when he called himself superboy from 1986 on beginning with man of steel 1 superman s powers emerged more slowly and he began his superhero career as an adult the kents teach clark he must conceal his otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good clark creates the costumed identity of superman so as to protect his personal privacy and the safety of his loved ones as clark kent he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his superman costume underneath his clothes so that he can change at a moment s notice to complete this disguise clark avoids violent confrontation preferring to slip away and change into superman when danger arises and in older stories he would suffer occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice in superboy 78 1960 superboy makes his costume out of the indestructible blankets found in the ship he came to earth in in man of steel 1 1986 martha kent makes the costume from human manufactured cloth and it is rendered indestructible by an aura that superman projects the s on superman s chest at first was simply an initial for superman when writing the script for the 1978 movie tom mankiewicz made it superman s kryptonian family crest 153 this was carried over into some comic book stories and later movies such as man of steel in the comic story superman birthright the crest is described as an old kryptonian symbol for hope clark works as a newspaper journalist in the earliest stories he worked for the daily star but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to the daily planet in comics from the early 1970s clark worked as a television journalist an attempt to modernize the character however for the 1978 movie the producers chose to make clark a newspaper journalist again because that was how most of the public thought of him 154 the first story in which superman dies was published in superman 149 1961 in which he is murdered by lex luthor by means of kryptonite this story was imaginary and thus was ignored in subsequent books in superman 188 april 1966 superman is killed by kryptonite radiation but is revived in the same issue by one of his android doppelgangers in the 1990s the death and return of superman story arc after a deadly battle with doomsday superman died in superman 75 jan 1993 he was later revived by the eradicator using kryptonian technology in superman 52 may 2016 superman is killed by kryptonite poisoning and this time he is not resurrected but replaced by the superman of an alternate timeline superman maintains a secret hideout called the fortress of solitude which is located somewhere in the arctic here superman keeps a collection of mementos and a laboratory for science experiments in action comics 241 the fortress of solitude is a cave in a mountain sealed with a very heavy door that is opened with a gigantic key too heavy for anyone but superman to use in the 1978 movie the fortress of solitude is a structure made out of crystal clark kent clark kent redirects here for other uses see clark kent disambiguation superman s secret identity is clark joseph kent a reporter for the daily planet although his name and history originate from his early life with his adoptive earth parents everything about clark was staged for the benefit of his alternate identity as a reporter for the daily planet he receives late breaking news before the general public always has a plausible reason to be present at crime scenes and need not strictly account for his whereabouts as long as he makes his publication deadlines he sees his job as a journalist as an extension of his superman responsibilities bringing truth to the forefront and fighting for the little guy he believes that everybody has the right to know what is going on in the world regardless of who is involved 155 in the bronze age of comic books clark kent was featured in a series that appeared primarily in the superman family the private life of clark kent where superman dealt with various situations subtly while remaining clark to deflect suspicion that he is superman clark kent adopted a mainly passive and introverted personality with conservative mannerisms a higher pitched voice and a slight slouch this personality is typically described as mild mannered as in the opening narration of max fleischer s superman animated theatrical shorts these traits extended into clark s wardrobe which typically consists of a bland colored business suit a red necktie black rimmed glasses combed back hair and occasionally a fedora clark wears his superman costume underneath his street clothes allowing easy changes between the two personae and the dramatic gesture of ripping open his shirt to reveal the familiar s emblem when called into action his hair also changes with the clothing change with superman sporting a small curl or spit curl on his forehead superman usually stores his clark kent clothing compressed in a secret pouch within his cape 156 though some stories have shown him leaving his clothes in some covert location such as the daily planet storeroom 157 for later retrieval as superman s alter ego the personality concept and name of clark kent have become synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities in 1992 superman co creator joe shuster told the toronto star that the name derived from 1930s cinematic leading men clark gable and kent taylor but the persona from bespectacled silent film comic harold lloyd and himself 158 clark s middle name is given variously as either joseph jerome or jonathan all being allusions to creators jerry siegel and joe shuster personality in the original siegel and shuster stories superman s personality is rough and aggressive he often uses excessive force and terror against criminals on some occasions even killing them this came to an end in late 1940 when new editor whitney ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow banning superman from ever killing 159 the character was softened and given a sense of humanitarianism ellsworth s code however is not to be confused with the comics code which was created in 1954 by the comics code authority and ultimately abandoned by every major comic book publisher by the early 21st century 160 in his first appearances superman was considered a vigilante by the authorities being fired upon by the national guard as he razed a slum so that the government would create better housing conditions for the poor by 1942 however superman was working side by side with the police 161 162 today superman is commonly seen as a brave and kind hearted hero with a strong sense of justice morality and righteousness he adheres to an unwavering moral code instilled in him by his adoptive parents 163 his commitment to operating within the law has been an example to many citizens and other heroes but has stirred resentment and criticism among others who refer to him as the big blue boy scout superman can be rather rigid in this trait causing tensions in the superhero community 164 this was most notable with wonder woman one of his closest friends after she killed maxwell lord 164 booster gold initially had an icy relationship with the man of steel but grew to respect him 165 having lost his home world of krypton superman is very protective of earth 166 and especially of clark kent s family and friends this same loss combined with the pressure of using his powers responsibly has caused superman to feel lonely on earth despite having his friends and parents previous encounters with people he thought to be fellow kryptonians power girl 167 and mon el 168 have led to disappointment the arrival of supergirl who has been confirmed to be his cousin from krypton relieved this loneliness somewhat 169 superman s fortress of solitude acts as a place of solace for him in times of loneliness and despair 170 powers abilities and weaknesses the catalog of superman s abilities and his strength has varied considerably over the vast body of superman fiction released since 1938 since action comics 1 1938 superman has superhuman strength the cover of action comics 1 shows him effortlessly lifting a car over his head another classic feat of strength on superman s part is breaking steel chains in some stories he is strong enough to shift the orbits of planets 171 and crush coal into diamond with his hands since action comics 1 1938 superman has a highly durable body invulnerable for most practical purposes at the very least bullets bounce harmlessly off his body in some stories such as kingdom come not even a nuclear bomb can harm him in the earliest stories superman s costume is made out of exotic materials that are as tough as he is which is why it typically doesn t tear up when he does superman feats in later stories beginning with man of steel 1 1986 superman s body is said to project an aura that renders invulnerable any tight fitting clothes he wears and hence his costume is as durable as he is even if made of common cloth in action comics 1 superman could not fly he traveled by running and leaping thanks to his superhuman speed which he could do to a prodigious degree thanks to his strength superman gained the ability to fly in the second episode of the radio serial in 1940 172 superman can fly at great speeds he can break the sound barrier and in some stories he can even fly faster than the speed of light to travel to distant galaxies superman can project and perceive x rays via his eyes which allows him to see through objects he first uses this power in action comics 11 1939 certain materials such as lead can block his x ray vision superman can project beams of heat from his eyes which are hot enough to melt steel he first used this power in superman 59 1949 by applying his x ray vision at its highest intensity in later stories this ability is simply called heat vision superman can hear sounds that are too faint for a human to hear and at frequencies outside the human hearing range this ability was introduced in action comics 11 1939 since action comics 20 1940 superman possesses superhuman breath which enables him to inhale or blow huge amounts of air as well as holding his breath indefinitely to remain underwater or space without adverse effects he has a significant focus of his breath s intensity to the point of freezing targets by blowing on them the freeze breath was first demonstrated in superman 129 1959 action comics 1 1938 explained that superman s strength was common to all kryptonians because they were a species millions of years advanced of our own in the first newspaper strips jor el is shown running and leaping like superman and his wife survives a building collapsing on her later stories explained they evolved superhuman strength simply because of krypton s higher gravity superman 146 1961 established that superman s abilities other than strength flight durability etc are activated by the light of earth s yellow sun in action comics 300 1963 all of his powers including strength are activated by yellow sunlight and can be deactivated by red sunlight similar to that of krypton s sun exposure to green kryptonite radiation nullifies superman s powers and incapacitates him with pain and nausea prolonged exposure will eventually kill him although green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form writers have introduced other forms over the years such as red gold blue white and black each with peculiar effects 173 gold kryptonite for instance nullifies superman s powers but otherwise does not harm him kryptonite first appeared in a 1943 episode of the radio serial 174 it first appeared in comics in superman 61 dec 1949 175 superman is also vulnerable to magic enchanted weapons and magical spells affect superman as easily as they would a normal human this weakness was established in superman 171 1964 like all kryptonians kal el is also highly susceptible to psychokinetic phenomena ranging along telekinesis illusion casting mind control etc as shown in wonder woman vol 2 219 sept 2005 a powerful enough psionic can affect either the psyche or microbiology of superman to induce strokes or mangle his internals as well as disrupt his mind and perceptions of the world something a young power amped gene bomb meta showcased in superman 48 oct 1990 supporting characters see

at the daily planet as jerry siegel conceived her lois considers clark kent to be a wimp but she is infatuated with the bold and mighty superman not knowing that kent and superman are the same person siegel objected to any proposal that lois discover that clark is superman because he felt that as implausible as clark s disguise is the love triangle was too important to the book s appeal 176 however siegel wrote stories in which lois suspects clark is superman and tries to prove it with superman always duping her in the end the first such story was in superman 17 july august 1942 177 178 this was a common plot in comic book stories prior to the 1970s in a story in action comics 484 june 1978 clark kent admits to lois that he is superman and they marry this was the first story in which superman and lois marry that wasn t an imaginary tale many superman stories since then have depicted superman and lois as a married couple but about as many depict them in the classic love triangle in modern era comic books superman and lois are a stable married couple and the superman supporting cast was further expanded with the introduction of their son jonathan kent other supporting characters include jimmy olsen a photographer at the daily planet who is friends with both superman and clark kent though in most stories he doesn t know that clark is superman jimmy is frequently described as superman s pal and was conceived to give young male readers a relatable character through which they could fantasize being friends with superman in the earliest comic book stories clark kent s employer is george taylor of the daily star but the second episode of the radio serial changed this to perry white of the daily planet 179 clark kent s foster parents are ma and pa kent in many stories one or both of them have died by the time clark becomes superman clark s parents taught him that he should use his abilities for altruistic means but that he should also find some way to safeguard his private life antagonists main article list of superman enemies the villains superman faced in the earliest stories were ordinary humans such as gangsters corrupt politicians and violent husbands but they soon grew more colorful and outlandish so as to avoid offending censors or scaring children the mad scientist ultra humanite introduced in action comics 13 june 1939 was superman s first recurring villain superman s best known nemesis lex luthor was introduced in action comics 23 april 1940 and has been depicted as either a mad scientist or a wealthy businessman sometimes both 180 in 1944 the magical imp mister mxyzptlk superman s first recurring super powered adversary was introduced 181 superman s first alien villain brainiac debuted in action comics 242 july 1958 the monstrous doomsday introduced in superman the man of steel 17 18 nov dec 1992 was the first villain to evidently kill superman in physical combat without exploiting superman s critical weaknesses such as kryptonite and magic alternative depictions main article alternative versions of superman see also superman earth two and superman earth one the details superman s story and supporting cast vary across his large body of fiction released since 1938 but most versions conform to the basic template described above a few stories feature radically altered versions of superman an example is the graphic novel superman red son which depicts a communist superman who rules the soviet union dc comics has on some occasions published crossover stories where different versions of superman interact with each other using the plot device of parallel universes for instance in the 1960s the superman of earth one would occasionally feature in stories alongside the superman of earth two the latter of whom resembled superman as he was portrayed in the 1940s dc comics has not developed a consistent and universal system to classify all versions of superman cultural impact and legacy the superhero archetype superman is often thought of as the first superhero this point can be debated ogon bat the phantom zorro and mandrake the magician arguably fit the definition of the superhero yet predate superman nevertheless superman popularized this kind of character and established the conventions a costume a codename extraordinary abilities and an altruistic mission superman s success in 1938 begat a wave of imitations which include batman captain america and captain marvel this flourishing is today referred to as america s golden age of comic books which lasted from 1938 to about 1950 the golden age ended when american superhero book sales declined leading to the cancellation of many characters but superman was one of the few superhero franchises that survived this decline and his sustained popularity into the late 1950s led to a revival in the silver age of comic books when characters such as spider man iron man and the x men were created after world war 2 american superhero fiction entered japanese culture astro boy first published in 1952 was inspired by mighty mouse which in turn was a parody of superman 182 the superman animated shorts from the 1940s were first broadcast on japanese television in 1955 and they were followed in 1956 by the tv show adventures of superman starring george reeves these shows were popular with the japanese and inspired japan s own prolific genre of superheroes the first japanese superhero movie super giant was released in 1957 the first japanese superhero tv show was moonlight mask in 1958 other notable japanese superheroes include ultraman kamen rider and sailor moon 183 184 185 fine art starting with the pop art period and on a continuing basis since the 1960s the character of superman has been appropriated by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork 186 187 most notably by andy warhol 188 189 roy lichtenstein 190 mel ramos 191 dulce pinzon 192 mr brainwash 193 raymond pettibon 194 peter saul 195 giuseppe veneziano 196 f lennox campello 197 and others 193 198 199 literary analysis superman has been interpreted and discussed in many forms in the years since his debut with umberto eco noting that he can be seen as the representative of all his similars 200 writing in time in 1971 gerald clarke stated superman s enormous popularity might be looked upon as signaling the beginning of the end for the horatio alger myth of the self made man clarke viewed the comics characters as having to continuously update in order to maintain relevance and thus representing the mood of the nation he regarded superman s character in the early seventies as a comment on the modern world which he saw as a place in which only the man with superpowers can survive and prosper 201 andrew arnold writing in the early 21st century has noted superman s partial role in exploring assimilation the character s alien status allowing the reader to explore attempts to fit in on a somewhat superficial level a c grayling writing in the spectator traces superman s stances through the decades from his 1930s campaign against crime being relevant to a nation under the influence of al capone through the 1940s and world war ii a period in which superman helped sell war bonds 202 and into the 1950s where superman explored the new technological threats grayling notes the period after the cold war as being one where matters become merely personal the task of pitting his brawn against the brains of lex luthor and brainiac appeared to be independent of bigger questions and discusses events post 9 11 stating that as a nation caught between the terrifying george w bush and the terrorist osama bin laden america is in earnest need of a saviour for everything from the minor inconveniences to the major horrors of world catastrophe and here he is the down home clean cut boy in the blue tights and red cape 203 an influence on early superman stories is the context of the great depression superman took on the role of social activist fighting crooked businessmen and politicians and demolishing run down tenements 204 comics scholar roger sabin sees this as a reflection of the liberal idealism of franklin roosevelt s new deal with shuster and siegel initially portraying superman as champion to a variety of social causes 205 206 in later superman radio programs the character continued to take on such issues tackling a version of the ku klux klan in a 1946 broadcast as well as combating anti semitism and veteran discrimination 207 208 209 scott bukatman has discussed superman and the superhero in general noting the ways in which they humanize large urban areas through their use of the space especially in superman s ability to soar over the large skyscrapers of metropolis he writes that the character represented in 1938 a kind of corbusierian ideal superman has x ray vision walls become permeable transparent through his benign controlled authority superman renders the city open modernist and democratic he furthers a sense that le corbusier described in 1925 namely that everything is known to us 210 the library of congress hosting a discussion with dan jurgens and paul levitz for superman s 80th anniversary and the 1 000th issue of action comics jules feiffer has argued that superman s real innovation lay in the creation of the clark kent persona noting that what made superman extraordinary was his point of origin clark kent feiffer develops the theme to establish superman s popularity in simple wish fulfillment 211 a point siegel and shuster themselves supported siegel commenting that if you re interested in what made superman what it is here s one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable joe and i had certain inhibitions which led to wish fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip that s where the dual identity concept came from and shuster supporting that as being why so many people could relate to it 212 ian gordon suggests that the many incarnations of superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the american way he defines this ideology as a means of associating individualism consumerism and democracy and as something that took shape around wwii and underpinned the war effort superman he notes was very much part of that effort 213 an allegory for immigrants superman s immigrant status is a key aspect of his appeal 214 215 216 aldo regalado saw the character as pushing the boundaries of acceptance in america the extraterrestrial origin was seen by regalado as challenging the notion that anglo saxon ancestry was the source of all might 217 gary engle saw the myth of superman asserting with total confidence and a childlike innocence the value of the immigrant in american culture he argues that superman allowed the superhero genre to take over from the western as the expression of immigrant sensibilities through the use of a dual identity superman allowed immigrants to identify with both of their cultures clark kent represents the assimilated individual allowing superman to express the immigrants cultural heritage for the greater good 215 david jenemann has offered a contrasting view he argues that superman s early stories portray a threat the possibility that the exile would overwhelm the country 218 david rooney a theater critic for the new york times in his evaluation of the play year zero considers superman to be the quintessential immigrant story b orn on an alien planet he grows stronger on earth but maintains a secret identity tied to a homeland that continues to exert a powerful hold on him even as his every contact with those origins does him harm 219 religious themes some believe that superman took inspiration from judaic mythology the british rabbi simcha weinstein notes that superman s story has some parallels to that of moses for example moses as a baby was sent away by his parents in a reed basket to escape death and adopted by a foreign culture weinstein also posits that superman s kryptonian name kal el resembles the hebrew words קו ל א ל qōl ʾēl which can be taken to mean voice of god 220 the historian larry tye suggests that this voice of god is an allusion to moses role as a prophet 221 the suffix el meaning god is also found in the name of angels e g gabriel ariel who are airborne humanoid agents of good with superhuman powers the nazis also thought superman was a jew and in 1940 joseph goebbels publicly denounced superman and his creator jerry siegel 222 all that said historians such as martin lund and les daniels argue that the evidence for judaic influence in siegel s stories is merely circumstantial jerry siegel and joe shuster were not practicing jews and never acknowledged the influence of judaism in any memoir or interview 223 224 superman stories have occasionally exhibited christian themes as well screenwriter tom mankiewicz consciously made superman an allegory for jesus christ in the 1978 movie starring christopher reeve baby kal el s ship resembles the star of bethlehem and jor el gives his son a messianic mission to lead humanity into a brighter future 225 this messianic theme was revisited in the 2013 movie man of steel wherein jor el asks superman to redeem the kryptonian race which corrupted itself through eugenics by guiding humanity down a wiser path 226 see also list of superman supporting characters list of dc animated universe characters list of dc comics characters kryptonian footnotes consolidated book
