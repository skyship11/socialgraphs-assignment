superman while aiding the squad clark misses a chance to save the life of jonathan kent 75 in writing about the version of superman in his series writer grant morrison said ma pa kent one dead we re going with the version where pa kent has died that s the day superboy becomes a man 76 dialogue between several characters implies that young clark is a costumed adventurer but he is never referred to as superboy 75 legal status edit the superboy character has been the subject of a legal battle between time warner the owner of dc comics and the estates of jerry siegel and joe shuster on november 30 1938 siegel pitched the idea for the character of superboy to detective comics the corporate forerunner to dc comics but the company declined the offer siegel pitched the idea again in december 1940 but again the company declined to use the material siegel enlisted in the u s army in july 1943 while he was stationed overseas detective comics directed joe shuster to draw a superboy comic strip for publication in more fun comics no notice was given to siegel and no consent from him was granted 77 78 siegel sued for copyright infringement and won a court appointed special referee declared the character of superboy unique and not derivative from the character of superman but appeals by both siegel and national comics publication the new name of detective comics led to a consent decree in which the parties agreed that superboy was the sole property of national comics 78 79 in 1969 siegel and shuster sought to recover their copyright to superman as the original 28 year copyright for the character had expired in siegel v national periodical publications inc 364 f supp 1032 s d n y 1973 aff d 508 f 2d 909 2nd cir 1974 the united states district court for the southern district of new york held that the 1948 agreement assigned not only the original 28 year copyright term but also the 28 year copyright renewal term as well to national periodical publications detective comics successor 80 in 1976 congress enacted a new copyright act this law extended existing copyrights for 19 years but it also gave creators of works the right to seek to recover their copyright when the extension was up the siegel claims edit in 1997 joanne siegel siegel s surviving wife and laura siegel larson siegel s daughter filed a notice exercising their rights to terminate dc comics copyright on the superman character the date of termination was 1999 but dc comics provided joanne siegel with certain benefits that induced the parties to keep negotiating a tolling agreement was signed to allow negotiations to keep moving 81 a the siegels shusters and dc comics began drafting an agreement and this agreement now referenced the superboy character and some indicia as well 81 on october 19 2001 larson s attorney issued a letter in which he claimed that the heirs accepted d c comics offer of october 16 2001 in respect of the superman and spectre properties 83 further negotiations broke down in 2002 and the siegel heirs filed suit in the u s district court for the central district of california claiming their half of the superboy copyright 84 on march 23 2006 judge ronald s w lew of the district court for the central district of california issued a summary judgment ruling that siegel s heirs had successfully reclaimed the copyright to the superboy character and related indicia as of november 17 2004 85 86 judge lew s decision left the parties in the unenviable situation of the siegels owning the copyright to superboy but time warner owning the trademark leaving neither party fully able to take advantage of their respective properties alone 87 at a subsequent trial in october 2006 time warner now the parent company of dc comics defended itself against a copyright infringement suit by the siegels by arguing that judge lew s summary judgment was incorrect in siegel v time warner 496 f supp 2d 1111 c d cal 2007 judge stephen g larson vacated judge lew s summary judgment and ordered a new trial on the issues b larson s ruling did not determine whether superboy was such a unique character that the character enjoyed its own copyright protection he said it was up to future litigation to determine whether the differences between superman and superboy were trivial and did not create a copyrightable character 86 attorney jesse j kruger however noted that character reboots and retcons could create enough differences so that any future version of superboy might avoid a claim by the siegels 86 the legal dispute affected dc comics treatment of the various incarnations of superboy in the secret origin of the teen titans back up story march 28 2007 in the weekly 52 limited series an illustration of superboy was changed into wonder girl 88 in the sinestro corps war storyline in the green lantern titles and in the countdown to final crisis limited series the superboy prime character was referred to as superman prime a development that came about in part because of the legal dispute 89 on march 26 2008 in siegel v warner bros entertainment inc 542 f supp 2d 1098 1145 c d cal 2008 judge larson ruled again that the superboy character was not a work for hire 90 larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the siegel heirs claim to the superman and superboy works 91 c the siegels regained the copyright to the superman character story and indicia as they appeared in action comics 1 but not prior to or after that 92 93 judge larson later expanded his ruling to allow the siegel heirs to claim additional plots superman characters costuming and indicia 94 95 this included the story of superman s origin as a kryptonian rocketed to earth from a dying planet in a spaceship created by his father 96 dc comics celebrated the decisions as they restored certain retconned versions of the superboy character to the company s use on june 28 2008 dc comics vice president and executive editor dan didio said in reference to the legion of three worlds comic at the wizard world chicago convention we ve got geoff johns writer we ve got george pérez artist we ve got superboy prime yes we can say that again 97 in january 2013 the ninth circuit court of appeals returned all rights over the superboy character and other indicia to dc comics 98 the appellate court held in larson v warner bros entertainment no 11 56034 d c no 2 04 cv 08400 odw rz 9 cir january 10 2013 that the district court for the central district of california erred when it said in 2008 that dc and the siegel heirs had not reached an agreement in 2001 resolving the dispute over the copyright the court of appeals remanded the case back to the district court with an order to find that a contract existed copyright attorney dallas kratzer said that the ninth circuit s ruling rendered moot all of the other questions in this lawsuit 99 the hollywood reporter said the ruling likely precludes any further attempt by the siegel heirs to terminate dc comics copyright ownership of the character although an appeal to the u s supreme court is not barred the ninth circuit also ruled 100 that dc comics could move ahead with a tortious interference lawsuit against siegel attorney marc toberoff whom dc accuses of interfering with the 2001 settlement 101 on remand the district court for the central district of california found that the 2001 agreement had terminated the siegel heirs rights to superboy the siegel heirs appealed arguing that the 2001 agreement did not cover the superboy copyrights because the rights at that time were not the siegels to grant 102 103 they also argued that the agreement alienated their copyrights contrary to law 103 d finally the heirs argued that joanne siegel had rescinded the 2001 agreement in 2002 an action in which dc comics had agreed 102 103 the ninth circuit court of appeals rejected all these arguments 102 the shuster claims edit joe shuster died in 1992 after his death dc comics and his sister jean shuster peavy entered into an agreement in which the company paid shuster s debts made survivor payments to shuster s brother frank and paid jean 25 000 a year for the rest of her life jean shuster peavy and frank shuster agreed to turn over all copyright interest in shuster s detective comics characters to dc comics the agreement also barred the shuster family from asserting these rights in the future 104 the agreement did not however specifically mention superman or superboy 105 in 2003 the joe shuster estate filed suit to recover shuster s copyright interest in superman superboy and other characters dc comics counter sued arguing the 1992 agreement barred any such claim in 2012 the u s district court for the central district of california held in dc comics v pacific pictures corp no cv 10 3633 odw rzx 2012 wl 4936588 c d cal oct 17 2012 that the 1992 agreement s broad all inclusive language was more than adequate to cover the superman and superboy copyrights in which shuster had an interest thus the estate was barred from seeking their termination under the copyright act whatever interest shuster had in superboy stayed with dc comics 105 the u s supreme court declined to hear the shuster family s appeal in october 2014 leaving the district court s ruling intact 106 in other media edit the adventures of superboy 1961

powers jonathan s superhero outfit is very similar to kon el s original superboy costume notes edit sometimes the statute of limitations may run out during negotiations rather than have negotiations end and the parties return to court the parties will sign a tolling agreement in which they agree not to invoke the statute of limitations this preserves the rights of the aggrieved party but also may serve as an inducement to keep bargaining 82 judge larson determined that the 1947 agreement was conclusive as to matters of law and the issues therein could not be relitigated e g it met the requirements for collateral estoppel larson concluded that the superboy character was not a work for hire however because of the way in which the character first saw light in more fun comics larson was not able to determine whether publication had occurred as defined by the copyright act publication was essential to asserting copyright and detective comics could not publish a character to which they lacked the rights larson was also unable to determine if superboy was a joint work by both siegel and shuster judge larson noted that although there was a 2001 letter from the siegels saying they had agreed to terms offered by time warner the subsequent confusion over what these terms were and the inclusion of what the siegels claimed were new provisions not previously discussed by the parties meant that in fact no agreement had been reached under california law 17 u s c 203 a 5 and 17 u s c 304 c 5 says that termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant references edit indicia changed to superboy the legion of super heroes with issue 231 the indicia changed to adventures of
