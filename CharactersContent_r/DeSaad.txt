fictional character biography edit darkseid with a young desaad art by colleen doran desaad s first recorded appearance in the history of the dc universe was as a hanger on at the side of drax heir to apokolips he had already taken his god name which he claimed to have taken in tribute to a being from the future who has taught me much in my chosen field desaad s origins were revealed during

youth s cat had killed his other pet a bird goading the boy to avenge the bird darkseid manipulates the youth into burying the cat alive the bird returned having flown off and in a rage the youth killed the bird and left new genesis to become darkseid s lackey 4 desaad appeared to be helping drax with his attempt to master the omega force in fact he was plotting with drax brother uxas as a result drax was presumed killed and uxas mastered the omega force taking the god name darkseid desaad went on to serve as darkseid s torturer 2 desaad is a racist and a coward he is naturally treacherous but is sufficiently afraid of darkseid that he will not turn against his master unless someone else takes the lead and will probably switch sides again if it looks like they will fail he
