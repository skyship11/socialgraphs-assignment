1960 2 captain atom was initially created for charlton comics but was later acquired by dc comics and revised for dc s post crisis continuity 3 in 2011 dc comics relaunched its superhero comics and rewrote the histories of some characters from scratch including captain atom giving him a new origin appearance and slightly altered powers captain atom was the character inspiration for doctor manhattan who was featured in the miniseries and later live action film adaptation watchmen which would be connected to the dc universe in the miniseries doomsday clock throughout the years the character has been featured in several moderate to short lived eponymous series and has been a member of several different versions of dc s flagship superhero team the justice league in all incarnations the character initially served for the military in the charlton comics continuity he was a scientist named allen adam and gained his abilities by accident when he was seemingly atomized and then his body reformed now existing as an atomic powered being in both dc comics incarnations he is an air force pilot named nathaniel adam who was a test subject in a scientific experiment who seemingly disintegrated in the process only to reappear later as the super powered captain atom 4 over the years dc has attempted to reinvent the character several times for a period the character assumed the mantle of the supervillain monarch and in 2005 dc attempted to retell the captain atom story with an entirely new character breach who was subsequently discarded in the new continuity following dc s 2011 relaunch captain atom has never been a member of the justice league and the team views him with distrust his character origin and abilities were also revised captain atom has appeared in several animated television and film adaptations of justice league and other dc storylines since the mid 2000s where he is depicted as a powerful member of the justice league whose abilities place him roughly on par with the franchise s flagship character superman in several animated depictions he has served the role as a government stooge when the government has brought itself into conflict with the justice league fictional character biography edit charlton comics silver age edit strange suspense stories 75 june 1965 a reprint issue of captain atom s debut cover art by steve ditko the charlton comics version of captain atom was allen adam the character s origin had adam working as a technician in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside 5 adam was atomized when the rocket exploded while entering the upper atmosphere however he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground he was outfitted in a red and yellow costume that was designed to shield people from the radiation of his nuclear powers when he powered up his hair changed to a silvery white later in his own title he replaced his original red and gold costume with a liquid metal outfit that was under his skin and which transformed when he powered up captain atom s powers were similar to such other nuclear powered superheroes as gold key s doctor solar and dell comics nukla captain atom was first published in a series of short stories in the anthology series space adventures 33 40 march 1960 june 1961 and 42 october 1961 charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology strange suspense stories beginning with issue 75 june 1965 renaming the title captain atom with issue 78 december 1965 and giving the hero full length stories and supervillain antagonists such as dr spectro previous stories involved cold war anti communist missions or dealing with aliens captain atom later teamed with the superhero nightshade with whom he shared a mutual attraction the superhero the blue beetle starred in the initial back up feature later replaced by a nightshade back up series captain atom was cancelled with issue 89 december 1967 in 1975 the unfinished ditko art for issue 90 was inked by john byrne and published in the first two issues of the official charlton fanzine charlton bullseye as the 10 page showdown in sunuria writer jon g michels and the 11 page two against sunuria writer roger stern captain atom next appeared in issue 7 may 1982 of the new talent showcase comic also called charlton bullseye in a story by writer benjamin smith and artist co writer dan reed which for some reason returned him to his original red and yellow outfit the character s last pre dc appearance was in ac comics one shot issue americomics special 1 august 1983 in a story teaming the charlton action heroes the blue beetle captain atom nightshade and the question as the sentinels of justice this last story had originally been done for charlton before the company folded the actual charlton characters made their first reappearance in dc s crisis on infinite earths which introduced earth four as the native reality of captain atom and the world where all the charlton comics adventures had taken place by story s end earth four and the charlton characters had been incorporated into the post crisis dc universe its history merging with that of the mainstream reality the last appearance of this charlton era captain atom was in dc comics presents 90 february 1986 dc comics post crisis edit this article s plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise april 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message a new post crisis version of the character was introduced in march 1987 with the launch of a monthly comic written by cary bates long time writer of the flash and superman co written by greg weisman and drawn by pat broderick 6 this modern captain s name is established as nathaniel christopher adam a united states air force officer and vietnam war veteran adam had been framed for a crime and was under military justice condemned to death this taking place under the purview of col wade eiling in the year 1968 as an alternative to execution adam was asked to participate in project captain atom a military experiment with a slim chance of survival he agreed to this in exchange for an unconditional presidential pardon the experiment involved testing the hull of a crashed alien ship s durability by placing a human being adam within the metal craft and then exploding an atomic weapon under it the weapon went off and adam was seemingly disintegrated eighteen years later adam suddenly reappeared the alien metal now bonded around his body afforded him incredible abilities far beyond that of a mere mortal bonded with the metal nathaniel adam now had powers that resulted from the metal s ability to tap into the quantum field 4 7 it was revealed that the alien metal could absorb energy but only past a certain threshold any excess absorption would force it to jump forward in time based on the amount of energy obtained flung into the year 1986 adam becomes literally a man out of time wade eiling is now a military general and the second husband of adam s now deceased wife angela everyone had assumed that nathaniel adam died the day of the experiment so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refused to acknowledge the previous pardon seizing the opportunity at hand eiling uses the outstanding murder treason charges against adam to blackmail him into acting as a military controlled government sanctioned superhero codenamed captain atom the events of the charlton stories are used cleverly by bates as a readymade fabricated past to convince the world that adam had secretly been a superhero for years enabling him to quickly gain the trust and reputation as an unsung patriot and hero for his non superhero activities nathaniel uses the alias cameron scott an air force intelligence operative during this time he meets the superpowered terrorist plastique a recurring part of nathaniel s life early conflicts involve him coming to terms with the lost time he missed with his now grown children the death of his wife her marriage to eiling and the overall ramifications of his newly acquired powers later he learns that project atom a secret government funded group that used new experimental machines to harness powerful energies had repeated the same process and created the supervillain major force a bloodthirsty madman lacking captain atom s morality and classic military a f discipline atom adam serves under eiling reluctantly while befriending research scientist doctor heinrich megala of project atom who had previously helped to create an elaborate cover story for atom adam doctor megala is responsible for creating the x ionizer technology capable of cutting the skin of most invulnerable metahumans 8 in spite of his disabilities and poor health he helped atom adam learn about the quantum field as well as about his powers captain atom later succeeds in clearing his name of the original treason charge and eventually rebels against eiling resigning from the air force and becoming an actual superhero by captain atom 39 megala s health would deteriorate to a point where he asked captain atom for help and attempted to use his atomic energy to neutralize the life threatening disease he is suffering from but becomes blinded as a side effect fearing that eiling would eventually turn on him megala claims that he intends to set up a contingency plan which would make public all of project atom s classified secrets once his heart ceased to function megala s plan proved to be a mere bluff when he is killed in a confrontation with the ghost a k a alec rois but captain atom decides to become the actual whistleblower and discloses the truth on national television captain atom joins the justice league at the request of the u s government eventually serving as leader of justice league europe during his career he has a brief romance with catherine cobert develops a friendly rivalry with firestorm whose nickname is the nuclear man becomes involved with and eventually marries plastique ironically a one time firestorm foe learns basic heroics from batman when he briefly loses access to the quantum field and commands the metahuman forces during the invasion storyline where earth was under attack by an alliance of alien forces captain atom was canceled as of issue 57 in 1991 because atom was slated to become the hero turned villain monarch in dc s armageddon 2001 crossover event however when word of this leaked out dc changed the ending at the last minute atom and the monarch character continue battling through time in armageddon the alien agenda limited series until he is returned to his own time at the conclusion captain atom then returns to the league involved in the zero hour crisis in 1994 9 founding an offshoot team extreme justice in 1995 10 while leading extreme justice captain atom comes across another version of monarch this one claiming to be the real nathaniel adam later in 1999 he is a member of the poorly received team known as the living assault weapons or l a w the members of whom are all previously charlton comics characters in 2003 he again teams up with several former members of the justice league as the super buddies in the humorous limited series formerly known as the justice league around this time various stories reintroduce atom s conflict between his role in the superhero community and his responsibilities as a government agent at some point atom s marriage to plastique ends in divorce apart from a brief mention of her at the beginning of l a w the marriage appears to be forgotten plastique has reappeared in 2006 as a villainess again undoing her reformation into a heroine a later confirmation is brought in by the captain atom armageddon miniseries in which after falling in love with angela spica of the authority captain atom reminisces about his short marriage with plastique and attributes their divorce to their irreconcilable views about world and politics since nathaniel even in his spousal life could not stop being a loyal soldier of the u s and plastique could not simply put aside her life as a terrorist later in 2003 writer jeph loeb returns captain atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government this time for president lex luthor in the first story arc of the superman batman series atom seemingly sacrifices his life to save superman and earth by piloting a starship to destroy a kryptonite meteor but as it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him he soon returns to life and to the background of the dc universe in a 2005 issue of superman batman it is made clear that captain atom survived the collision with the kryptonite meteor but has absorbed massive amounts of radiation and become a super villain described as a kryptonite man the radiation is siphoned out of captain atom using a device made by hiro okamura the new toyman which returns captain atom to his usual self if somewhat confused armageddon and worldstorm edit in 2005 2006 captain atom appears in a nine part limited series entitled captain atom armageddon under dc s wildstorm imprint captain atom s sacrifice in superman batman sends him to the wildstorm universe for the duration of the series in this title he wears a yellow red outfit that was first seen in the 1996 kingdom come limited series at the moment of his apparent death captain atom experiences a time shift coinciding with his 2005 appearance in superman batman resulting in his arrival in the wildstorm universe he quickly gets into a fight with an overzealous mister majestic and the fight ends with majestic soundly defeated seeing the frightened reactions of onlookers and puzzling over his own altered appearance he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an alternate earth one where superheroes are feared by the general populace mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe he is in fact an instrument used ultimately by nikola

lane wanting to stress the similarities between adam and tim zanetti or planet breaker captain atom refers to his name and rank as codename captain atom 19 captain atom returns in a co feature in action comics 879 and appears in his normal costume instead of the monarch armor he was last seen wearing he is shown to reside in a mystical medieval reminiscent realm attacking a highly fortified castle for unknown reasons other than as he states his mission after obliterating the castle s defenses he has a brief flashback to a moment with the justice league then falls to the ground disoriented no explanation is given for his return to his original appearance his whereabouts since countdown to final crisis or why he has reverted to his heroic persona rather than that of the conquest seeking monarch in action comics 880 it is revealed that captain atom has little or no memory of who he is other than his name it is revealed that this mysterious realm is connected to project 7734 and is part of his conditioning later he is attacked by major force an enemy believed to have been destroyed by captain atom himself when he first became monarch 20 mon el appears and helps captain atom escape taking him to the justice league s satellite where the league members declare that they are going to bring him to justice for his actions as monarch 21 after a struggle with the league captain atom tells them what he can remember the league reminds him he was a hero who once saved the planet he feels he has changed from the man he once was and that he needs to go back to the magic world to make right what he has done the shadowpact are called on to join him on his quest and provide a way for him to reach sorcerers world 22 generation lost edit captain atom appears as one of the central characters in justice league generation lost a maxi series that takes place during the wider brightest day event at the start of the series captain atom is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the jli s founder and ted kord s murderer maxwell lord during an encounter with max at the justice league s former new york headquarters captain atom is rendered unconscious alongside fire ice and booster gold the former justice league members awake to discover that lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet save for those present at the embassy and the others 23 afterwards captain atom discovers that max has mentally influenced the us army into believing that he had betrayed them 24 captain atom shares with the group that when he absorbed a nuclear bomb max had set off he found himself thrown through time to the future of 24th century an earth that had fallen into chaos through metahuman wars and backward in technology atom found a woman elderly and grotesque who turned out to be an aged power girl telling him it was maxwell lord who was responsible for all of this atom is then pulled back into the present and tells the rest of the team that the world needs them to stop the instigated max 25 after discovering that the omacs had dismembered a droid captain atom was struck by magog who simply scoffs at the notion and states that he has come to kill captain atom at the behest of max 26 in their battle captain atom manages to convince magog he is being manipulated by max magog stops the attacks as he remembers max s existence and captain atom is prepared to help him however max is on hand and forces magog to kill himself with his spear max uses his powers to manipulate everyone into believing that captain atom has killed magog before leaving captain atom realizes magog s spear is about to explode with energy captain atom tries to absorb as much as he can thrusting him into the time stream again as a crater is left behind 27 captain atom is propelled through time again to 112 years in the future where a metahuman war against the omacs had devastated the planet captain atom battled for survival alongside the future versions of the justice league but they all are eventually contaminated by a new nanovirus version of the omacs and one by one become omacs themselves as a dying power girl tells him that the catalyst for all this was the death of wonder woman by max s hands captain atom is returned into the present but not before batman orders him to terminate the omac project to stop max s plan 28 during the final battle against the new omac known as omac prime captain atom allows omac prime to absorb his energy before reabsorbing the energy and overloading his powers resulting in him being thrown into the time stream once again just before this occurred captain atom grabbed max and threatened to pull him into the time stream as well unless max undid the global mindwipe of his existence max complied and everyone on the planet had their memories of him restored before captain atom was pulled away to a time and space unknown max later released a statement onto the internet exonerating captain atom of the deaths in chicago saying far worse would have happened if he had not intervened 29 the new 52 edit in the new 52 reboot of dc s continuity captain atom is reintroduced with altered powers appearance and origin he is still usaf pilot nathaniel adam in the new reality adam volunteers to participate in an experiment conducted by a research facility called the continuum at this facility dr megala s research is focused on the quantum field and on dimensional transfer through m theory adam is asked to pilot the dimensional transfer vessel by dr megala who is now presented as a particle physicist working out of colorado 30 but is seemingly atomized during the experiment soon afterwards he reappears now an energy based life form according to dr megala captain atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve tapping into the strong nuclear force the energy that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus adam s physical atoms are constantly splitting apart giving him incredible power his body maintains integrity by instantly re merging these atoms but extreme use of his powers can interfere with this process and cause captain atom s form to become unstable this leads to a fear that at some point captain atom s brain might lose its molecular stability and he will not be able to fix it before it impairs his consciousness or causes him to suffer some form of brain death 31 in the new reality nathaniel adam has been only captain atom for a few months and is still exploring his abilities constantly learning new facets to them such as his ability to perceive wireless transmissions from cell phones and computers 32 he frequently returns to the continuum so that dr megala and the staff can help him further understand his abilities and occasionally so they can stabilize his body when he seems to be having problems the world at large looks on captain atom with suspicion due to uncertainty about his agenda and the nature of his abilities some fear that he is leaking radiation and potentially poisoning those he comes into contact with several have remarked that the justice league may have rejected captain atom for membership due to suspicion of how dangerous he is 33 despite this nathaniel chooses to try and use his powers to help others on earth clandestinely if need be during a fight with megala who had taken control of firestorm s body atom is forced to absorb a massive amount of energy released which splits his molecules apart into the timestream one of these pieces is found in the 31st century where he names himself nathaniel adym 34 adym had become an agent of echo a covert branch of the science police assigned to monitor the timestream 35 as part of his duties he had interacted with members of the legion of super heroes stranded in the past in legion lost along with his subordinates agent jocelyn lure and agent yera allon adym is last seen escaping

abilities he went into dr megala s subterranean suppression dome but seemingly exploded 37 the world believed nathaniel adam was killed in a blast however adam took a subatomic trip through time and ended up without powers 20 years in the past 38 it is revealed that the quantum blowback sent him back in time to 1994 as a normal man 37 adam s wound distorted after being shot during an attempted car robbery and his body was encased in liquid metal 39 as a result of the time stream correcting itself he was thrown back to 2017 39 powers and abilities edit powers edit in the post crisis dc comics universe captain atom s dilustel skin is tied into the quantum field which enables him to absorb and manipulate theoretically infinite amounts of energy limited by only his willpower and imagination this energy can be used for flight which is generally faster than the speed of sound in earth s atmosphere and up to half light speed in the vacuum of space super strength shown at times to be on par with martian manhunter though another source the dc heroes roleplaying game defines his level of strength second only to superman s among the heroes of the dc universe though as monarch he was capable of effortlessly overwhelming three versions of superman durability he has survived exploding nuclear weapons and even energy sufficient to wipe out all life within the universe of earth 51 although this was his own energy self sustenance and life support allowing him to live and even speak in space and controlling energy of any form in addition to high speed flight he has been shown to possess enhanced reflexes atom s abilities stem from his link to the quantum field which provides a virtually infinite source of quantum energy which can be used for a vast number of effects he commonly manipulates his energy into force field bubbles or explosive bombs but the most common form is a simple energy blast atom has been shown to be capable of manipulating even exotic energies such as magic and has a high degree of resistance to such attacks over the years captain atom has become an expert at energy manipulation and he can fire energy blasts from any point on his body although he usually uses his hands for better aim he can fire in multiple directions at once or from every point of his body at once several times he has detonated releasing a massive amount of energy at once destroying objects within a certain radius as demonstrated by his destruction of bludhaven on more than one occasion he has used his ability to manipulate all forms of energy to prevent a foe using their own powers such as the ray and firestorm if atom absorbs too much energy at once the energy transports him uncontrollably through time depending on the type of energy absorbed he either goes forward or backward in time though he also possesses the ability to voluntarily move forward in the time stream captain atom states that through concentration he can briefly travel ahead in time about a week or so the process is exhausting and the period he can interact in the future appears to be limited to a few minutes before he returns to the present in the case of involuntary quantum jumping he is typically shown as being stuck in the time stream for as long as it takes his body to process any absorbed energy captain atom can also convert energy to matter in the same manner he manipulates energy originally he needed a pair of gloves invented by the blue beetle to do so but he has since learned to do so without them he is capable of manipulating matter on an atomic or sub atomic level at a limited scale he has used his atomic transmutation powers to turn both maul and the engineer back to their human forms this power can be used instinctively or through concentration though atom has conceded he is not very good at it in the same way he learned to access weak force energy as a consequence of his energy manipulation abilities he is able to telepathically interface with computer networks he has on occasion used this to repel telepathic intrusions by downloading information directly into other telepaths with focus and effort captain atom can increase any of his abilities to match his current willpower up to an unknown level as monarch prior to absorbing the captain atom brigade his powers and abilities were increased to such a level that he was capable of effortlessly containing several versions of powerful heroes such as superman wonder woman and several green lanterns atom has shown the capacity to absorb matter as well as energy typified by his absorption of the captain atom brigade as monarch he possessed all of his inherent abilities at much higher levels as well as teleportation and awareness of and access to different realities he was capable of storing enough energy that upon its release was capable of wiping all life from the alternate earth 51 except for its monitor and a single plant later writers and editors have introduced a radioactive aspect of captain atom s physical makeup this seems to contradict the quantum nature of atom s powers as originally introduced as he previously did not emit radiation when his skin was cut open towards the end of his series run it was speculated that captain atom is an elemental quantum elemental along with the swamp thing earth the red tornado air firestorm fire and naiad water in addition to his superhuman abilities nathaniel adam is also an experienced united states air force pilot it is notable that he is one of the few superheroes with a captain appellation that corresponds to a military rank he has actually held he is especially skilled in combat piloting is trained in military weaponry strategy and hand to hand combat 40 and speaks multiple languages including russian 41 adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the vietnam war dilustel edit captain atom s metallic shell or skin is composed of a portion of the alien being known as silver shield and is called dilustel pieces of the alien s metal body were used in project atom and on later subjects like major force and bombshell nathaniel is able to coat himself with the metal either partially or totally atom s symbiosis with the metal is such that even partially armored he is able to access the quantum field the metal is almost indestructible resistant to various degrees of damage from energy heat lasers etc only x ionizer technology can cut the metal as established when the captain atom project uses it to remove the silver shield s skin the katana wielded by the cambodian that once sliced through atom s side was also x ionized the magical guns of the crimson avenger were able to crack his skin breaking through it causes captain atom to quantum jump as if he has absorbed too much energy x ionizer edit the x ionizer is a hardening technology invented by the specialists of project atom introduced in the cary bates run of the dc comics published captain atom because of the nearly invulnerable nature of the alien metal discovered the scientists needed some way to cut it in order to perform experiments doctor heinrich megala one of the lead researchers of the project developed a device that would make the molecular lattices of an object by knitting together positive negative ion particles in such a way that it became superdense and compact this in effect makes the object nearly indestructible also any edge on an x ionized object would attain the sharpness of a monofilament enabling both it and its user to cut finer and cleaner than the most advanced blade or laser once transformed the object would then be able to cut through virtually any material including the dilustel quantum metal skin of the silver shield which was used to empower captain atom major force and bombshell 42 a mercenary known as the cambodian wore a suit of x ionized armor and uses an x ionized katana to cut through captain atom s skin in captain atom 7 43 a famous physicist and former c i a operative turned dangerous cult leader and quantum powered supervillain called the ghost theorized that properties hardened and honed by such a device undergo a form of mantling taking on properties very similar to the extra dimensional biometal belonging to the silver shield entity dc rebirth edit after dc rebirth captain atom is restored to his post crisis powers his new 52 powers have seemingly disappeared former powers edit his former drastically altered new 52 powers are a being whose atoms are constantly splitting and then reforming just as quickly releasing massive amounts of energy this surplus of power can be manipulated in a number of ways such as flight and the ability to transmute physical matter captain atom has been seen to transform lava into snow by willing it and has been able to remove cancer from a human being he can also absorb massive amounts of energy captain atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve
