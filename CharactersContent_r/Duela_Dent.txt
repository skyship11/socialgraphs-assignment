the monitor of new earth suggests that duela s father is actually an alternate version of the joker indicating she didn t belong making others think she was the joker s daughter which on that world she most certainly was not 8 dan didio editor in chief of dc has stated that duela s murder would have a ripple effect throughout the series 9 nightwing robin donna troy wonder girl and ravager set out to investigate duela s death but their inquiries are cut short by one of the monitors who diverts their attention elsewhere 10 in countdown presents the search for ray palmer crime society it is

and her stepfather the earth 3 riddler and together the three formed the riddler family when she was finally introduced to her birth father she dropped cryptic hints implying that she or her consciousness shifts unknowingly from earth to earth which is the source of her parental confusion when the jokester joined the riddler family duela revealed that she had been in a relationship with talon owlman s teenaged sidekick the jokester renounced her as his daughter and duela left with talon moments before the crime society stormed their apartment the riddler was killed by ultraman and three face s arm was torn off by superwoman the jokester managed to flee until he is later tracked down and killed by solomon the monitor who killed duela the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline duela dent is re established in catwoman 23 11 the character was featured in the villains month one shot comic book batman the dark knight 23 4 12 and in early 2014 the character was further explored in yet another one shot 13 in the aftermath of death of the family in which the joker seemingly falls to his death 14 his face which he previously had cut off 15 is found by a psychotic young woman living in the sewers the woman wears the severed flesh as a mask dubbing herself the joker s daughter she becomes obsessed with not only serving the joker but also with having his blood course inside of her so she can truly become his daughter refusing to accept the joker s apparent death she begins harming murdering and destroying other people and property in order to find him and get his attention this leads her to the dollmaker who is responsible for removing the joker s face per his request after making a deal with each other dollmaker gives the joker s daughter vials of her father s blood so she could inject it into her veins and he sews the joker s face onto hers after failing to find her father the joker s daughter gives up hope until she receives a note from someone claiming to be the joker 13 during batman eternal joker s daughter participates in the mass scheme against batman including attempting to use the spirits of arkham to resurrect her father in the body of maxie zeus only to summon the spirit of deacon blackfire instead and later confronts batgirl at the carnival where the joker took commissioner gordon after shooting barbara as portrayed in batman the killing joke the joker later returns in the endgame storyline very much alive 16 much to the dismay of fellow member harley quinn the joker s daughter is recruited

following villains joker 20 catwoman 21 scarecrow 22 riddler 22 penguin 22 two face 22 doomsday doctor light punch and jewelee duela is originally depicted as the daughter of two face and his estranged wife gilda dent creator bob rozakis stated it didn t take too long to decide whose daughter she would turn out to be after all the only married villain was two face i convinced editor julius schwartz and associate editor e nelson bridwell the acknowledged keeper of dc s historical consistency that harvey and gilda dent had a daughter that harvey had been disappointed because she wasn t a twin and that they d named her duela 23 rozakis upon being asked his thought regarding the current insane version of duela dent who claims to be the daughter of multiple supervillains replied i got a laugh out of it when i first saw it but i thought they wasted the character i realize that marv and company didn t want her around anymore and felt they had to explain her away because of continuity but they could have just as easily ignored her actually i consider harley quinn to be a reincarnation of duela 23 it is later revealed that the earth 3 hero the jokester is her biological father and three face evelyn dent is her mother since evelyn disappeared from duela s father s life while she was still pregnant he was not aware of duela s existence until her teen years as a result duela s stepfather the riddler helped evelyn raise her upon meeting the clown prince of crime duela started calling herself the joker s daughter even though her real father s hero name was the jokester other

follow his style so has the joker inspired a few to take after his chaotic clown style the original joker s daughter who actually turned out to be two face s daughter was a former member of the teen titans and has no direct relation to this new riot girl version nor is there a true familial relation to the joker the joker s daughter ii is modeled on jill thompson a writer artist thompson is chicago based as is alex ross austin loomis adds that thompson has occasionally drawn herself into stories that she was illustrating for vertigo it is noted throughout this series that the joker s daughter ii is always quite dour and serious quite the change from her namesake and another example of the generational clash theme of kingdom come following the death of von bach ex1machina points
