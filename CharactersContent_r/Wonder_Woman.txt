companies that would merge to form dc comics 20 at that time marston wanted to create his own new superhero marston s wife and fellow psychologist elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman 21 william moulton marston a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero one who would triumph not with fists or firepower but with love fine said elizabeth but make her a woman marston introduced the idea to gaines given the go ahead marston developed wonder woman whom he believed to be a model of that era s unconventional liberated

love leader the kind of woman who he believed should run society frankly wonder woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who i believe should rule the world marston wrote 25 in a 1943 issue of the american scholar marston wrote 26 not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force strength and power not wanting to be girls they don t want to be tender submissive peace loving as good women are women s strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness the obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman william moulton marston marston was an outspoken feminist polyamorist and firm believer in the superiority of women 27 28 he described bondage and submission as a respectable and noble practice marston wrote in a weakness for wonder woman which was attached to a fictional stipulation that he dubbed aphrodite s law that made the chaining of her bracelets of submission together by a man take away her amazonian super strength 29 the only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable peaceful human society william moulton marston golden

museum of antiquities her tremendously long life span accumulation of immense amount of knowledge and exceptional perceptiveness makes diana prince the wisest and most emotionally intelligent female member of the justice league 57 58 during marston s run diana prince was the name of an army nurse whom wonder woman met the nurse wanted to meet with her fiancé who was transferred to south america but was unable to arrange for money to do so as wonder woman needed a secret identity to look after steve who was admitted to the same army hospital in which diana prince worked and because both of them looked alike wonder woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse s credentials and took diana prince as her alias 59 she started to work as an army nurse and later as an air force secretary 59 60 the identity of diana prince was especially prominent in a series published in the early 1970s in which she fought crime only under the prince alias and without her mystic powers to support herself she ran a mod clothing boutique 61 62 the diana prince alias also played an important role after the events of infinite crisis wonder woman was broadcast worldwide killing a

prince alias whenever she was around clark kent such as when she introduced herself to lois lane at lois s housewarming party under that name 68 personality edit at last in a world torn by the hatred and wars of men appears a woman to whom the problems and feats of men are mere child s play a woman whose identity is known to none but whose sensational feats are outstanding in a fast moving world she serves as a symbol of integrity and humanity so that the world of men would know what it means to be an amazon with a hundred times the agility and strength of our best male athletes and strongest wrestlers she appears as though from nowhere to avenge an injustice or right a wrong as lovely as aphrodite as wise as athena with the speed of mercury and the strength of hercules she is known only as wonder woman narrator all star comics 8 introducing wonder woman written by william moulton marston many writers have depicted diana in different personalities and tone between both of her diametric extremes that of a worldly warrior a highly compassionate and calm ambassador and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person depending on the writer what has remained in constant existence and is a mainstay of the character is the dichotomy of her dominant force aspect and her nurturing humanity her overwhelming belief in love empathy compassion and having a strong conscience the latter aspect had been the reason for her induction into the star sapphires 69 70 writer gail simone was applauded for her portrayal of wonder woman during her run on the series with comic book reviewer dan phillips of ign noting that she s molded diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character 71 actress gal gadot described wonder woman as an idealist experienced super confident open and sincere even in the midst of a gruesome bloody conflict having many strengths and powers but at the end of the day she s a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence 72 73 in the golden age wonder woman adhered to an amazon code of helping any in need even misogynistic people and never accepting a reward for saving someone 74 while conversely the modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other alternative exemplified in the killing of maxwell lord in order to save superman s life 63 64 brian azzarello stated in an interview that the new 52 version of the character was being written as a very confident impulsive and good hearted character in her he referred to her trait of feeling compassion as both her strength and weakness

which were contributed by elizabeth holloway marston 77 3 others edit main article alternative versions of wonder woman diana after her death was granted divinity as the goddess of truth by her gods for such faithful devotion 78 during her brief time as a god of olympus diana was replaced in the role of wonder woman by her mother queen hippolyta 79 unlike diana receiving the title of wonder woman in honor hippolyta s role as wonder woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in artemis death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter 80 john byrne the writer that introduced the concept of hippolyta as the first wonder woman has explained his intentions in a post in his message board i thought george s one mistake in rebooting wonder woman was making her only 25 years old when she left paradise island i preferred the idea of a diana who was thousands of years old as if i recall correctly she was in the tv series from that angle i would have liked to have seen diana having been wonder woman in ww2 and be returning to our world in the reboot 81 not having that option i took the next best course and had hippolyta fill that role 81 as wonder woman queen hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with jay garrick 82 after this mission she elected to join the justice society of america and remained in that era for

protege helena the golden age fury these visits happened yearly from young lyta s perspective and also accounted for hippolyta s participation in the jsa jla team ups when she returned from the past hippolyta took diana s place in the jla as well 84 85 following wonder woman s ascension to heaven and return to the living in infinite frontier she officially gives her blessing for her mother

addition to her previous attributed olympian and amazon combined strength in addition diana s bracelets can now create a thunderous explosion or expel lightning when she clashes them together however the bracelets are not the source of her power rather it is diana s for any other amazon user the gauntlets would not have an offensive ability diana can also manipulate lightning and create weapons out of lightning bolts these new abilities are attributed to being the daughter of hippolyta and zeus her powers are now considered nearly unmeasurable if she goes without her bracelets of submission

about the decision to give the amazons heeled sandals jenkins explained that they also have flats for fighting adding it s total wish fulfillment i as a woman want wonder woman to be sexy hot as hell fight badass and look great at the same time the same way men want superman to have ridiculously huge pecs and an impractically big body that makes them feel like the hero they want to be and my hero

dimensional transport up until the unpowered era of diana prince when wonder woman resumed superpowered costumed operations in 1973 she continued to use the jet as before but did glide on air currents for short distances at one point aphrodite granted the plane the power to fly faster than the speed of light for any interstellar voyages her champion might undertake 211 thanks to tinkering by

s legendary shield the aegis to be awarded to her champion the shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she goat amalthea who suckled zeus as an infant these forearm guards have thus far proven nigh indestructible the omega beams of grail have proven able to shatter them and are able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks allowing wonder woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts 214 diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like superman s ears bleed 63 recently she gained the ability to channel zeus s lightning through her bracelets as well zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation because they were once part of the aegis and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use 215 after the 2011 relaunch of the character it was revealed that diana was the daughter of zeus and hippolyta 137 and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from zeus in check 190 in addition hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow wonder woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet each sword marked with a red star takes shape from a flash of lightning and when wonder woman is done with them the swords disappear supposedly back into her bracelets as such she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows spears and energy bolts among others 216 the inspiration to give diana bracelets came from the pair of bracelets worn by olive byrne creator william moulton marston s research assistant and lover 3 wonder woman and her sister amazons have to wear heavy bracelets to remind them of what happens to a girl

chains of the hitler type beat them and made them work like horses in the fields aphrodite goddess of love finally freed these unhappy girls but she laid down the rule aphrodite s law that they must never surrender to a man for any reason i know of no better advice to give modern day women than this rule that aphrodite gave the amazon girls 217 lasso of truth edit main article lasso of truth the

only times it has been broken were when wonder woman herself refused to accept the truth revealed by the lasso such as when she confronted rama khan of jarhanpur 218 and by bizarro in matt wagner s non canonical batman superman wonder woman trinity 219 during the golden age the original form of the lasso had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them even overriding the mind

attacks as well as allowing her to telepathically contact people such as the amazons back on themyscira using the power of the red star ruby in its center 63 as a temporary inductee into the star sapphires wonder woman gained access to the violet power ring of love this ring allowed her to alter her costume at will create solid light energy constructs and reveal a person s true love to them

is a feminist act the whole diana myth women safeguarding the world from male violence not with nurture but with better violence is a feminist act casting robin wright as wonder woman s aunt re imagining the battle axe as a battler with an axe is a feminist act a female german chemist trying to destroy humans in the shape of dr poison a proto mengele before nazism existed might be the most feminist act of all 250 alyssa rosenberg for the washington post said none of these experiences crushed me of course but i do wonder what it might have been like if they hadn t happened the power of wonder woman and one of the things that gives jenkins s adaptation of the character such a lift is in the answer to that question diana prince gal gadot doesn t have any idea what women and men are or aren t supposed to do even when she does encounter other people s ideas about gender roles she doesn t automatically accept them and she never lets anyone stop her and the movie goes a step further and argues that it s not merely little girls all over the world who stand to gain if they can grow up free of the distorting influence of misogyny a world like that would be liberating and wonderful for men in lots of ways too 251 emma gray for huffpost said when it comes to pop culture we speak often about representation the simple yet often unfulfilled idea that it matters to see someone like you fill a variety of imagined roles on screen after awhile these conversations almost begin to feel obvious we know that it s good to see women and people of color and disabled people and trans people and queer people in the same numbers and variety of roles that white cisgender straight men have long been afforded but what these discussions often lose is the emotional impact of finally seeing something you may have never even realized you were missing for many women viewers wonder woman filled a hole they didn t know they had 252 pacifist icon edit gloria steinem editor for ms magazine and a major supporter of wonder woman stated marston had invented wonder woman as a heroine for little girls and also as a conscious alternative to the violence of comic books for boys 253 badower described a near international incident involving an unnamed russian general rolling dozens of tanks and munitions through a shady mountain pass as an outstanding example for standing up to bullies she ends up deflecting a bullet back and disarming the general he says adding that she doesn t actually do anything violent in the story i just think that wonder woman is smarter than that 254 nick pumphrey stated that wonder woman stands as a non violent beacon of hope and inspiration for women and men 255 256 grant morrison stated i sat down and i thought i don t want to do this warrior woman thing i can understand why they re doing it i get all that but that s not what wonder woman creator william marston wanted that s not what he wanted at all his original concept for wonder woman was an answer to comics that he thought were filled with images of blood curdling masculinity and you see the latest shots of gal gadot in the costume and it s all sword and shield and her snarling at the camera marston s diana was a doctor a healer a scientist 257 258 259 260 261 paquette detailed the changes he made to wonder woman s costume stating that he removed the iconic american flag theme and instead incorporated a greek influence the animal associated to aphrodite is a dove so instead of an eagle on wonder woman s breastplate it will be more of a dove it s not the american eagle it s the aphrodite dove stuff that creates the letter w is by accident so it s not like she already has a letter of the alphabet on her costume in the end i ve created a structure so it feels inevitable for wonder woman to look the way she does 262 lgbt icon edit william marston s earliest works were notorious for containing subversive bondage and sapphic undertones subtext among wonder woman s famous catchphrases suffering sappho was a direct reference to lesbianism fredric wertham s seduction of the innocent referred to her as the lesbian counterpart to batman whom he also identified as a homosexual after marston s death in 1947 dc comics downplayed her sexuality and feminist origin wonder woman without marston s creative direction become more traditional superhero fare the lesbian relationships and sexual imagery disappeared from the wonder woman comic along with wonder woman s super powers during the comics code authority decades since wonder woman s subversiveness had been gradually stripped away subsequent comic book writers and artists either didn t know what do with her or barely hinted at wonder woman s erotic legacy 263 but under the new 1987 re boot of the title under the editorship of karen berger and with the writing and art of george perez at the helm of the book the same sex appreciation by wonder woman and the amazons was more than hinted at and this was established quickly in the new run of the title upon her first sight of supporting character vanessa kapatelis in issue 3 she is shown smiling upwards at kapatelis thinking to herself i ve never seen another woman quite like her she s so young so vulnerable so beautiful 264 three years later in the first issue 38 of a new decade there is a story line presenting a cultural exchange between appointed leaders from man s world who are the first mortals to visit themyscira in this continuity and the amazons of themyscira in themyscira itself the guest unitarian minister reverend cantwell asks the amazon mnemosyne don t you miss the sharing god intended for the sexes to which mnemosyne replied some do they have sworn themselves to artemis the virgin hunter and athena the chaste warrior others choose the way of narcissus but most of us find satisfaction in each other three thousand years can be a long time reverend 265 probably more than at any other time in the then nearly fifty year history of the character the amazons were explicitly and unequivocally defined in general as lesbian additionally kevin mayer brother of the major supporting character myndi mayer was openly gay and this was treated sympathetically 266 by this time dc comics was a warner brothers owned company and had been for over 20 years wonder woman is suggested as being queer 267 or bisexual as she and another amazon io had reciprocal feelings for each other 268 grant morrison s 2016 comic wonder woman earth one which exists parallel to the current dc comics rebirth canon diana is depicted being kissed on her right cheek by a blonde woman who has put her left arm around diana 269 in 2016 issue 48 of sensation comics featured wonder woman officiating a same sex wedding drawn by australian illustrator jason badower my country is all women to us it s not gay marriage it s just marriage she states to superman inspired by the 2015 june supreme court ruling that established same sex marriage in all 50 united states badower says dc comics was fantastic about his idea for the issue in an interview with the sydney morning herald he said his editor was like great i love it let s do it it was almost anticlimactic 270 diana s mother the queen at the very least authorized or in some cases officiated these weddings badower says it just seems more like a royal duty diana would take on that she would do for people that would appreciate it 254 wonder woman actress gal gadot reacted positively to diana s rebooted orientation and agreed her sexuality was impacted by growing up in the women only themyscira gadot stated that wonder woman feels she need not be labelled sexually and is just herself she s a woman who loves people for who they are she can be bisexual she loves people for their hearts 271 272 coming from a society that was only populated by women lesbian in the world s eyes may have been straight for them 273 her culture is completely free from the shackles of heteronormativity in the first place so she wouldn t even have any concept of gender roles in sex 274 wonder woman s advocacy for women rights and gay rights was taken a step further in september 2016 when comic book writer greg rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual according to her rebooted rebirth origin 275 276 rucka stated nobody at dc comics has ever said wonder woman gotta be straight nobody ever they ve never blinked at this 273 rucka stated that in his opinion she has to be queer and has obviously had same sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women 277 278 this follows the way wonder woman was written in the alternate continuity or non canon earth one by grant morrison 279 and fellow wonder woman writer gail simone staunchly supported rucka s statement 280 surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase rucka responded to haters that consensual sex with women is just as important to wonder woman as the truth is to superman 281 sexual icon edit wonder woman s signature weapon is her lasso of truth consequently much of her crime fighting powers came from bondage and her only exploitable weakness was essentially bondage grant morrison and yanick paquette had teamed up to work on wonder woman earth one 262 wonder woman s sexual and bondage themes in her earliest days were not without purpose however her creator william moulton marston theorized that human relationships could be broken down into dominance submission inducement and compliance roles which were embedded into our psyche because males were more often than not dominant in societies marston believed that women as a sex are many times better equipped to assume emotional leadership than are males 282 marston wanted to convey his progressive ideals through his use of bondage imagery that women are not only capable of leadership roles but should be in charge of society although marston had good intentions with these themes in wonder woman s early appearances the bondage elements were controversial as they were often seen to overly fetishize women in power rather than promote such women noah berlatsky criticized this imagery in wonder woman s earliest days noting that the comics take sensual pleasure in women s disempowerment 283 despite having the mixed messages of this imagery marston fiercely believed that women would soon rule the earth and meant to showcase his predictions through sexual themes in his stories he was an open feminist while studying at harvard where he once said girls are also human beings a point often overlooked 284 see also edit wikiquote has quotations related to wonder woman alternative versions of wonder woman for elseworlds and other characters to bear the title amazons dc comics diana prince
