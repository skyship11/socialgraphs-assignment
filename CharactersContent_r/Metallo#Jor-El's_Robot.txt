4 nearly 40 years would pass before the character reappeared in print to challenge superman again metalo had improved his armor and serum and also exposed superman to a ray that reduced his power

s robot edit cover of superman family 217 april 1982 artwork by rich buckler pencils and dick giordano inks a different metallo appeared as jor el s robot to battle superboy 7 john corben edit john corben was originally a journalist and secretly a thief and murderer who had just committed what he thought was the perfect murder while fleeing from the scene of the crime he suffered a near fatal accident that mangled his body beyond repair 8 an elderly scientist professor vale happened to come upon him and used his scientific skill to transfer corben s brain into a robotic body covered by a flesh like artificial skin 9 corben discovered that his power source a capsule of uranium would only last one day but was told by vale that kryptonite would provide him an indefinite power supply 10 after obtaining a job with the daily planet corben briefly tried to romance lois lane while deciding that he would use his powers to eliminate superman the one person who might expose his criminal deeds after setting a kryptonite death trap for superman corben stole what he thought was another sample of kryptonite from a museum as a new power supply not knowing it was a fake prop this mistake caused him to die just as he was about to kill lois lane for discovering that he was not superman as he had pretended to be being super strong and invulnerable as a cyborg superman eventually escaped from the kryptonite trap and arrived just after metallo john corben had died 11 12 metallo as drawn by john byrne in superman vol 2 1 january 1987 after john byrne rewrote superman s origins in the 1986 miniseries the man of steel metallo was also given an altered backstory in this version john wayne corben was a small time con man who was fatally injured in a car crash but thanks to luck professor emmet vale happened to pass by professor vale was a pioneer in robotics and erroneously believed that superman was the first in a wave of superpowered kryptonian invaders after recovering superman s ship and mistranslating jor el s message to his son vale transplanted corben s brain into a robotic alloy body which was powered by a two pound chunk of kryptonite and instructed him to kill superman metallo now corben s new moniker thanked vale by snapping his neck and killing him 13 despite ignoring vale s commands metallo came into conflict with superman on various occasions largely due to his continued activities as a petty thug metallo later lost his kryptonite heart to lex luthor though back up life support systems allowed him to reactivate himself and escape he remained a thorn in superman s side and was powerful enough to cripple the doom patrol still the indian born hero who called herself celsius did blow him apart with her thermal powers metallo later received a major upgrade via an unholy bargain with the demon neron as a result metallo could morph his body into any mechanical shape he could imagine such as turning his hands into guns or growing a jet pack from his back and project his consciousness into any technological or metallic device he could also grow to monstrous size during one battle his gigantic fists were separated and later turned into housing by other superheroes in another incident metallo was rendered more insane by the joker and used his height to destroy an elevated train of commuters as superman and others learned on various occasions the most effective way to neutralize metallo was to remove his largely invulnerable head and isolate it from other metallic items in superman batman 2 november 2003 lex luthor fabricated evidence implicating john corben as the criminal who shot and killed thomas wayne and martha wayne instead of joe chill 14 superman secret origin edit in the 2009 10 miniseries superman secret origin which retells the origins of superman and his supporting cast metallo is sgt john corben and serves under lois lane s father general sam lane general lane is trying to push his daughter lois into a relationship with corben though they had one date she does not return his feelings for her corben is next seen signing up for a military option to neutralize superman ostensibly with the help of a powersuit built by lexcorp however in his first encounter with superman a stray bullet hit the kryptonite rock inside the suit leading to a disastrous energy cascade within the battlesuit which almost killed corben through the efforts of lex luthor and a crack team of scientists corben survived part man part machine with the kryptonite rock functioning as his new heart driven by a hatred for this alien invader he became the villain known as metallo metallo now wearing a green orange and red armor subsequently attacked superman again in a rampage which endangered not only the citizens of metropolis but his own fellow soldiers he was defeated by superman once more the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline john corben is under the command of general sam lane 15 general lane tells him to talk to lois lane when she keeps questioning where superman is it is implied that corben and lois once had a relationship when superman escapes from the military s custody corben is seen enlisting in what appears to be a military project co opted by lex luthor general lane and young scientist dr john henry irons project steel soldier to go against superman 16 corben is seen in the experimental metal zero metal 0 suit with scientists mostly irons trying to help him he continues believing that he did it for the affection of lois and when the robotic needles are in his head coined metallo he takes control and his heart bursts then screams where is superman 17 although the attack on superman succeeds metallo is revealed to have been subverted by brainiac as part of his own plans and his rampage is defeated when doctor irons uses an armored suit of his own to fight corben and upload a computer virus that he designed in the event of such a situation 18 after escaping and still under brainiac s control corben continued to fight superman until he was able to reason with metallo and to fight brainiac s influence because of his feelings for lois lane in doing so corben attacked brainiac until superman could defeat the villain but he subsequently fell into a coma and was taken back by the army 19 it was revealed during the forever evil storyline that the armor was keeping him alive thanks to alien technology but without a heart he would soon die general lane told his scientists to find a way to save him since he helped to save metropolis he was later given a kryptonite heart to keep him alive since it was the only energy compatible with his cybernetics 20 after 31 months in a vegetative state corben was brought back with a shard of kryptonite to active duty in the u s army since his actions caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians general lane tried to kill him by exploding the plane he was being carried in he survived and sought vengeance against lane at his base only to be confronted by an upgraded soldier like himself metal 2 0 when corben proves too much metal 2 0 activates his self destruct mechanism hoping to destroy corben along with himself however he is saved by the scarecrow and offered a place in the secret society of super villains now calling himself metallo ultraman later rips off his kryptonite heart because of his addiction to the mineral 21 corben was eventually seen again incarcerated in john henry s isolated super prison eventually drafted by the u s government again shortly afterwards but is only brought back into their service by compunction from lois once more who was secretly under brainiac s influence 22 given the present danger he represents as doomsday was taking him over lois convinced metallo to run superman down in a kryptonite bombing run and was summarily incinerated by the blast all that was left of him being the metal zero exo mantel fused to his charred remains 23 lois now completely subsumed by the brainiac consciousness inside of her is able to recreate corben s essential self by downloading her memory of the man he was into what s left of the old metal 0 suit said facsimile of the now deceased military sergeant a loyal echo of whom he once was obedient to lane s every whim 24 he would serve as her bodyguard while dox s influence compelled her to cripple military defense systems around the world he would immediately switched sides once lois is freed from the coluan s control however and aided her in combating the extraterrestrial threat to their world 25 as superman and lois departed to stop brainiac metallo was left on earth to defend metropolis in their stead 26 after the crisis is resolved corben is later seen standing guard over metropolis with krypto seemingly contented with his current position 27 in the wake of superman s identity being outed to the world as the hero began losing his powers many an investigation was undertaken into his identity contacts and motives by collective interests seeing as her life was in more danger than ever before metallo stuck close to his love as she went and did some investigating of her own in the meantime 28 while vandal savage made his play for ultimate power lois and metallo were close by on the scene where superman kept his warship from crushing a small town while aiding superman as lois refused to leave his side during the battle with savage s empowered progeny john s bionic shell was badly damaged looking to make good with all the bad in his life he willingly offered his kryptonite heart to superman the depowered hero having discovered a treatment for his loss of powers that essentially involved giving himself chemotherapy with kryptonite knowing full well that he could not survive without it 29 dc rebirth edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2017 in dc rebirth metallo is briefly a member of a new version of the superman revenge squad also consisting of general zod mongul the cyborg superman the eradicator and blanque after superman is temporarily blinded they are defeated when lex luthor supergirl superwoman kong kenan and steel come to superman s aid and zod betrays the rest of the team for his own ends 30 roger corben edit a second metallo john s brother roger corben debuted in superman 310 by curt swan and martin pasko this metallo was created by a secret organization named skull that transferred roger s brain into a new robotic body so that he could get revenge on superman for his brother s death like the previous metallo this one was also powered by kryptonite although this newer version wore orange and green armor as well as a green helmet to conceal the new identity he had created using plastic surgery which turned out to be wgbs staffer martin korda 31 this version of metallo returned throughout the bronze age his final appearance was featured in alan moore s whatever happened to the man of tomorrow 1986 32 powers and abilities edit metallo s metallic body offers him a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks he has enhanced abilities and no longer needs to eat sleep or breathe his brain is hermetically sealed inside a shielded alloy skull that has its own power supply when he was first created he was powered by a kryptonite heart losing that he subsisted on plutonium instead additionally because of his cyborg body metallo possesses superhuman strength and speed enough to pose a challenge and even a threat to opponents such as superman in that case he also takes advantage of the weakening power of kryptonite besides his own strength over the course of his criminal career metallo s body would be decimated constantly by various circumstances as such he would receive numerous upgrades or whole new chassis to replace his damaged parts such as by the obscure supervillain organization cerberus which modified him with a vastly superior body one with lead lined skull plating and an anatomic layer that even superman could not demolish 33 this gave him greatly enhanced strength and durability coupled with moderate mechanical regeneration to repair internal damage 34 he was later outfitted with a larger lexcorp tech body which gave him laser vision and further augmented his physical abilities 35 soon after it was destroyed corben had received a new body from a fellow kryptonite powered supervillain conduit which gave metallo radioactive blasts from his hands and could utilize geomagnetism to make him physically immovable even by the man of steel so long as he stood on solid ground or flooring within a building complex 36 metallo would eventually sell his soul or what was left of it to the archdemon neron in return for increased power 37 gaining the abilities to mentally control and absorb any mechanical or metal object he focuses on and transforming any technology himself included into an extension of his exoskeleton an ability similar to cyborg superman in experimenting with his newfound abilities metallo found he could alternate differing energy frequencies for harnessing and redistributing it from various power sources 38 brainiac 13 upgraded metallo to tap into various light spectra to better utilize his kryptonite charged abilities his mechanical body was also upgraded to be able to grow towards monolithic proportions 39 he is also occasionally portrayed as having a liquid metal based endoskeleton possessing the ability to morph parts of his body specifically his limbs into different weapons or tools such as chainsaws shovels hammers etc while not a genius like lex luthor or brainiac corben s time spent with machines has given him a gifted understanding of how they work enabling him to tinker with their mechanical functions even before gaining his technomorphing capabilities 40 during the publishing of salvation run it is revealed metallo also boasts a high calculus cyber mind with which to run the numbers of possible probable outcomes as well as success ratios through in the previous continuity the pre flashpoint lex luthor modified corben to holster
