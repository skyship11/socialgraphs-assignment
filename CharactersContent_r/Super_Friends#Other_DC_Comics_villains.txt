lines for the later series involved many of the familiar dc comics super villains that the first incarnation of the super friends did not instead like the comic books they focused on the far fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens who were invariably revealed as being well intentioned and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means 5 typically at the end of each story a peaceful and reasonable discussion would be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods 6 the all new super friends hour departed somewhat from the previous series formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals as a rule they could not be reasoned with requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them beginning with challenge of the superfriends several of the heroes arch villains from the comic books such as lex luthor and the riddler began to feature prominently in comic style stories throughout the series plots often wrapped themselves up neatly in the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and deus ex machina 5 production history edit in 1973 the american broadcasting company abc acquired rights to the dc comics characters and partnered with animation company hanna barbera to adapt the justice league of america comic book for television 7 the network made several

league on the show the violence common in superhero comics was toned down for a younger audience and to adhere to broadcast standards governing violence in 1970s children s television as a dc comics based show the super friends franchise was owned by dc s parent company warner bros who later put the series into syndication cartoon network which had the rights to air most of the rest of the hanna
