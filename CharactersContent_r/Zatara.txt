appearance in action comics 1 in which zatara often but not exclusively used backwards speech to accomplish his magic he first appeared starring in his own story zatara master magician by writer and artist fred guardineer in the anthology american comic book series action comics starting with the first issue june 1938 1 according to writer al sulman the time came when fred guardineer didn t want to draw the zatara series anymore so the editor turned it over to my brother joe sulman and he began to draw the strip but he had to imitate fred guardineer s drawing style because the character had to look the same and it worked out fine 2 fictional character biography edit john zatara is introduced as a magician in various publications of dc comics beginning with 1938 s action comics 1 which also contains the first appearance of superman like the very similar mandrake the magician zatara had a large east indian as a friend bodyguard called tong to share his early adventures 3 as well as being an illusionist zatara also had genuine magical powers decades later ascribed to being a descendant of the homo magi which he focused through speaking backwards he could do anything so long as he could describe it in sdrawkcab hceeps backwards speech 4 this helped distinguish zatara from the numerous mandrake the magician knockoffs that cluttered the comics and pulp magazines of the day although merlin the magician quality comics also had this attribute and it was also given to him by zatara s creator fred guardineer according to jess nevins encyclopedia of golden age superheroes he fights egyptian wizards an evil druid zulus a mad lama mongol warriors the gorilla king a saturnian terror and moon men 5 his love of magic began early when he was given a magic kit by his uncle himself a professional illusionist although he began learning the craft in childhood his early attempts at performing professionally were unsuccessful until he realized that he needed to work on his showmanship his lessons in magic were bolstered by visits from the phantom stranger and he had a sexual relationship with madame xanadu but she refused to marry him because she saw his future 6 to that end he acquired the old diaries of leonardo da vinci who was a direct ancestor while reading the diaries which da vinci wrote in backwards spelling as a security precaution zatara learned that his family had the command of magic he discovered this inadvertently when he accidentally gave a command to a mannequin to begin waving an arm wildly zatara realized that he could command it to stop by giving the order in backwards spelling with this new knowledge zatara developed a successful show during the premiere performance a fire broke out on stage forcing zatara to use his command of real magic to put it out while the audience mistook the incident as part of the act zatara realized that this power could be invaluable in helping people and he resolved to use it as such between shows 7
