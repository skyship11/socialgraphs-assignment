dc comics the character created by writer tony isabella and artist trevor von eeden first appeared in black lightning 1 april 1977 during the bronze age of comic books 1 although his precise origin story has varied over the years he has generally always been depicted as a metahuman superhero who uses the ability to generate and control electricity to defend his community and the world as black lightning although not the first black superhero to feature in dc comics stories black lightning was dc s first african american superhero to headline his own series 2 in his earliest stories black lightning is depicted as a schoolteacher from the crime ridden suicide slum area of metropolis who acquires electrical superpowers from a technologically advanced power belt that he puts to use to clean up crime in his neighborhood over time pierce establishes himself as a successful superhero in the dc universe and later stories depict him as having internalized the belt s powers as a result of his latent metagene later retellings of black lightning s origins simplify his story by depicting him as a metahuman with the inborn ability to manipulate and generate electricity the character later goes on to father two superhero daughters thunder and lightning and work closely alongside batman as a founding member of the outsiders superhero team dc originally commissioned isabella to create its first black character following on from isabella s successful work for marvel comics with luke cage however only 11 issues of the series were published before dc ran into financial trouble in 1978 which led them to cut back the majority of their titles this proved to be a blessing in disguise however as the character went on instead to feature prominently in books like justice league of america in dc s new slimmed down offering of titles exposing him to more readers with the character was remembered for promoting critical perspective on established superheroes like batman and superman early elements of the character were controversial and later removed or toned down for example in early stories he wore an afro wig and spoke in an exaggerated harlem jive vernacular to disguise that he was in fact the highly educated schoolteacher jefferson pierce black lightning has proven a popular character for dc and was ranked 85th overall on ign s top 100 comic books heroes
