is a fictional character who first debuted in the graphic novel limited series watchmen published by dc comics the comedian was created by writer alan moore with artist dave gibbons as with most of the main characters in the series he was an analogue for a charlton comics character in this case the peacemaker moore imagined the comedian as a mix between the peacemaker with a little bit of nick fury and probably a bit of the standard captain america patriotic hero type 1 contents 1 character background 1 1 events of watchmen 1 2 before watchmen 1 3 events of doomsday clock 2 character

operative hollis mason the original nite owl had published his autobiography under the hood by this point and in it disclosed the comedian s sexual assault on sally jupiter silk spectre in 1966 he was invited to join the crimebusters by captain metropolis but he quickly ruined the older hero s hopes of a new team by mocking him and pointing out that old fashioned crime fighting methods would not save the world from nuclear war 3 alongside doctor manhattan the comedian played a major role in the united states war with vietnam shortly after manhattan s godlike powers forced the north vietnamese to surrender blake was confronted by his lover a pregnant vietnamese woman she is referred to as liao lin in david hayter s watchmen draft 4 he told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country

the corner of his mouth after this incident he began wearing a leather gimp style mask when dressed as the comedian 5 the costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977 in response congress passed the keene act requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active the majority of them retired in anonymity while others such as rorschach continued their activities in open defiance of the law doctor manhattan and the comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered even going so far as to suggest to members of president nixon s staff that he had killed bob woodward and carl bernstein before they could reveal the details of the watergate scandal as well as being behind the assassination of john f kennedy on nixon s orders the iran hostage crisis in 1980 was resolved when blake freed the captives after an assault 6 it was during his return from a government mission in 1984 that blake discovered the island where adrian veidt ozymandias was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy new york city shocked and appalled by what he finds blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals veidt s plan he drunkenly breaks into edgar jacobi s house and cryptically describes the plan knowing jacobi will not understand but not realizing veidt has the bedroom bugged veidt to ensure that blake does not compromise his operation confronts blake in his high rise apartment and throws blake out of the window killing him 7 8 before watchmen edit in before watchmen the minutemen 1 additional details are revealed about the comedian while material from the main story is somewhat retconned it is revealed that the comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the minutemen he is shown to be driven by greed and an inherent love for violence in particular he assaults a bartender after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register the issue also implies blake may have been a victim of severe child abuse as he claims that a caseworker told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts though blake s status as an unreliable narrator makes the claim uncertain 9 before watchmen comedian 1 rewrites the character s back story further it is revealed that blake was close personal friends with robert f kennedy and john f kennedy as well as jackie kennedy this contradicts the main watchmen series which cast edward blake as a close personal friend of richard nixon for whom he had worked as an assassin the mini series reveals that blake was responsible for the murder of marilyn monroe ordered by jackie kennedy behind her husband s back as well as revealing that despite strong innuendo from both blake and ozymandias 10 that he did not kill john kennedy and was attempting to confront moloch when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination including kennedy s death which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief 11 it is implied that a former fbi agent with a resemblance to blake may have been behind it 12 events of doomsday clock edit in the sequel comic book doomsday clock the comedian seemingly turns up alive when he confronts ozymandias at the time when he was in the dc universe meeting with lex luthor 13 it is revealed that doctor manhattan has captured the comedian from moments before his death causing him to wash ashore outside the city of metropolis and greeting him 14 the comedian continues on the trail of mime and marionette 15 he catches up to joker mime and marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by riddler to discuss the superman theory he makes himself known by shooting typhoon in the face while pursuing them he evades giganta s attacks shoots riddler in the leg and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present when mime and marionette are in bed together the next morning the comedian catches up to them planning to use them to find ozymandias before the comedian can do anything joker comes to mime and marionette s rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on the comedian 16 as batman gets free and fights joker mime and marionette escape with the comedian and the lantern battery 17 upon catching up with ozymandias and shooting him lex luthor shoots the comedian with a device which returns him to the moment he was taken from leaving him to die which horrified him and feeling denied of his revenge 18 character inspiration and origin of name edit alan moore has stated that the comedian besides his comic book inspirations was also based on g gordon liddy a former fbi agent and a figure in the watergate scandal as the chief operative in the white house plumbers unit during the nixon administration 19 liddy was convicted of conspiracy burglary and illegal wiretapping for his role in the scandal 20 moore imagined the comedian as liddy with comic book muscles 21 in the comic rorschach explains that blake s moniker of the comedian stems from his cynical and arguably selfish world perspective that in an insane world one can only laugh as if everything is a joke moore took the idea of the name from graham greene s novel the comedians 22 powers and abilities edit the comedian was a skilled hand to hand combatant in excellent physical condition even at the time of his death at the age of 61 blake was proficient with his m1911 45 caliber pistol mac 10 submachine gun and pump action shotgun and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures flamethrowers grenade launchers etc his government sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare the smiley face badge edit throughout the work the comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the smiley face button which is closely associated with him and has become the iconic symbol of the watchmen series as a whole at the beginning of the series the button is smeared with a single drop of blood which if the button is viewed as a clock face is at the position of the minute hand of the doomsday clock at the time of the series five minutes to midnight in other media
