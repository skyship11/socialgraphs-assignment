his first appearance in batman 121 february 1959 and was created by dave wood sheldon moldoff and bob kane 4 from the time of his first appearance in 1959 the character was portrayed as one of many joke villains cast as stock enemies of batman 2 he was originally called mr zero in the comics 5 but the producers of the 1960s batman television series renamed him mr freeze and portrayed batman addressing him as dr otto schivel and the name quickly carried over to the comic books 2 in the pre crisis continuity it is explained that mr freeze is a rogue scientist whose design for an ice gun backfires when he inadvertently spills cryogenic chemicals on himself resulting in him needing sub zero temperatures to survive 2 origin story edit originally called mr zero 2 he was renamed and

batman revitalized him once again batman the animated series retold mr freeze s origin in heart of ice an episode by writer paul dini the episode introduced his terminally ill cryogenically frozen wife nora which explained his obsession with ice and need to build a criminal empire to raise research funds 9 this more complex tragic character was enthusiastically accepted by fans and has become the standard portrayal for the character in most forms of media including the comic book series itself which previously had the character casually killed off by the joker 10 freeze was resurrected in the comic after the episode aired 11 the episode was seen as groundbreaking for a saturday morning cartoon and helped set the tone for the rest of the series this backstory was also made canon in the
