joker s design while acknowledging finger s writing contribution although the joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance he was spared by editorial intervention allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero batman in his comic book appearances the joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind introduced as a psychopath with a warped sadistic sense of

the joker has been part of the superhero s defining stories including the murder of jason todd the second robin and batman s ward and the paralysis of one of batman s allies barbara gordon the joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances the most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste that bleaches his skin white and turns his hair green and lips bright red the resulting disfigurement drives him insane the antithesis of batman in personality and appearance the joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary the joker possesses no superhuman abilities instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry including razor tipped playing cards deadly joy buzzers and acid spraying lapel flowers the joker sometimes works with other gotham city supervillains such as the penguin and two face and groups like the injustice gang and injustice league but these relationships often collapse due to the joker s desire for unbridled chaos the 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the joker in his former psychiatrist harley quinn who became his criminal sidekick and girlfriend before finally escaping their abusive relationship although his primary obsession is batman the joker has also fought other heroes including superman and wonder woman one of

1928 veidt s grinning visage inspired the joker design bill finger bob kane and jerry robinson are credited with creating the joker but their accounts of the character s conception differ each providing his own version of events finger s kane s and robinson s versions acknowledge that finger produced an image of actor conrad veidt in character as gwynplaine a man whose mouth is disfigured into a perpetual grin in the 1928 film the man who laughs as an inspiration for the joker s appearance and robinson produced a sketch of a joker playing card 2 3 robinson stated that it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character s concept and finger associated that image with veidt in the film 2 kane hired the 17 year old robinson as an assistant in 1939 after he saw robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations 4 beginning as a letterer and background inker robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created batman comic book series in a 1975 interview in the amazing world of dc comics robinson said he wanted a supreme arch villain who could test batman not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed of he wanted an exotic enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for batman similar to the relationship between sherlock holmes and professor moriarty designing a diabolically sinister but clownish villain 5 6 7 robinson was intrigued by villains he believed that some characters are made up of contradictions leading to the joker s sense of humor he said that the name came first followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand i wanted somebody visually exciting i wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression would be bizarre would be memorable like the hunchback of notre dame or any other villains that had unique physical characters 8 he told finger about his concept by telephone later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic joker playing card design finger thought the concept was incomplete providing the image of veidt with a ghastly permanent rictus grin 5 kane countered that robinson s sketch was produced only after finger had already shown the gwynplaine image to kane and that it was only used as a card design belonging to the joker in his early appearances 3 finger said that he was also inspired by the steeplechase face an image in steeplechase park at coney island that resembled a joker s head which he sketched and later shared with future editorial director carmine infantino 9 in a 1994 interview with journalist frank lovece kane stated his position bill finger and i created the joker bill was the writer jerry robinson came to me with a playing card of the joker that s the way i sum it up the joker looks like conrad veidt you know the actor in the man who laughs the 1928 movie based on the novel by victor hugo bill finger had a book with a photograph of conrad veidt and showed it to me and said here s the joker jerry robinson had absolutely nothing to do with it but he ll always say he created it till he dies he brought in a playing card which we used for a couple of issues for him the joker to use as his playing card 10 11 robinson credited himself finger and kane for the joker s creation he said he created the character as batman s larger than life nemesis when extra stories were quickly needed for batman 1 and he received credit for the story in a college course 12 in that first meeting when i showed them that sketch of the joker bill said it reminded him of conrad veidt in the man who laughs that was the first mention of it he can be credited and bob himself we all played a role in it the concept was mine bill finished that first script from my outline of the persona and what should happen in the first story he wrote the script of that so he really was co creator and bob and i did the visuals so bob was also 13 finger provided his own account in 1966 i got a call from bob kane he had a new villain when i arrived he was holding a playing card apparently jerry robinson or bob i don t recall who looked at the card and they had an idea for a character the joker bob made a rough sketch of it at first it didn t look much like the joker it looked more like a clown but i remembered that grosset dunlap formerly issued very cheap editions of classics by alexandre dumas and victor hugo the volume i had was the man who laughs his face had been permanently operated on so that he will always have this perpetual grin and it looked absolutely weird i cut the picture out of the book and gave it to bob who drew the profile and gave it a more sinister aspect then he worked on the face made him look a little clown like which accounted for his white face red lips green hair and that was the joker 14 although kane adamantly refused to share credit for many of his characters and refuted robinson s claim for the rest of his life many comic historians credit robinson with the joker s creation and finger with the character s development 2 3 4 9 by 2011 finger kane and robinson had died leaving the story unresolved 5 9 15 golden age from the joker s debut in batman 1 april 25 1940 the joker debuted in batman 1 april 1940 as the eponymous character s first villain about a year after batman s debut in detective comics 27 may 1939 the joker initially appeared as a remorseless serial killer and jewel thief modeled after a joker playing card with a mirthless grin who killed his victims with joker venom a toxin that left their faces smiling grotesquely 16 the character was intended to be killed in his second appearance in batman 1 after being stabbed in the heart finger wanted the joker to die because of his concern that recurring villains would make batman appear inept but was overruled by then editor whitney ellsworth a hastily drawn panel indicating that the joker was still alive was added to the comic 2 17 18 the joker went on to appear in nine of batman s first 12 issues 19 the character s regular appearances quickly defined him as the archenemy of the dynamic duo batman and robin he killed dozens of people and even derailed a train 20 by issue 13 kane s work on the syndicated batman newspaper strip left him little time for the comic book artist dick sprang assumed his duties and editor jack schiff collaborated with finger on stories around the same time dc comics found it easier to market its stories to children without the more mature pulp elements that had originated many superhero comics during this period the first changes in the joker began to appear portraying him as a wacky but harmless prankster in one story the joker kidnaps robin and batman pays the ransom by check meaning that the joker cannot cash it without being arrested 21 comic book writer mark waid suggests that the 1942 story the joker walks the last mile was the beginning point for the character s transformation into a more goofy incarnation a period that grant morrison considered to have lasted the following 30 years 22 the 1942 cover of detective comics 69 known as double guns with the joker emerging from a genie s lamp aiming two guns at batman and robin is considered one of the greatest superhero comic covers of the golden age and is the only image from that era of the character using traditional guns robinson said that other contemporary villains used guns and the creative team wanted the joker as batman s adversary to be more resourceful 23 24 silver age the joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in batman comics from the golden age into the silver age as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics in 1951 finger wrote an origin story for the joker in detective comics 168 which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal red hood and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat 25 by 1954 the comics code authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content the backlash was inspired by frederic wertham who hypothesized that mass media especially comic books was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency violence and homosexuality particularly in young males parents forbade their children from reading comic books and there were several mass burnings 2 the comics code banned gore innuendo and excessive violence stripping batman of his menace and transforming the joker into a goofy thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies 17 26 the character appeared less frequently after 1964 when julius schwartz who disliked the joker became editor of the batman comics 2 17 27 the character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series batman in which he was played by cesar romero 2 17 the show s popularity compelled schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein as the show s popularity waned however so did that of the batman comics 2 27 after the tv series ended in 1969 the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic s sales decline editorial director carmine infantino resolved to turn things around moving stories away from child friendly adventures 28 the silver age introduced several of the joker s defining character traits lethal joy buzzers acid squirting flowers trick guns and goofy elaborate crimes 29 30 bronze age cover of batman 251 september 1973 featuring the joker s five way revenge which returned the joker to his homicidal roots art by neal adams in 1973 after a four year disappearance 2 the joker was revived and revised by writer dennis o neil and artist neal adams beginning with batman 251 s the joker s five way revenge the character returns to his roots as an impulsive homicidal maniac who matches wits with batman 31 32 this story began a trend in which the joker was used sparingly as a central character 33 o neil said his idea was simply to take it back to where it started i went to the dc library and read some of the early stories i tried to get a sense of what kane and finger were after 34 o neil s 1973 run introduced the idea of the joker being legally insane to explain why the character is sent to arkham asylum introduced by o neil in 1974 as arkham hospital instead of to prison 35 adams modified the joker s appearance changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner 36 dc comics was a hotbed of experimentation during the 1970s and in 1975 the character became the first villain to feature as the title character in a comic book series the joker 37 the series followed the character s interactions with other supervillains and the first issue was written by o neil 38 stories balanced between emphasizing the joker s criminality and making him a likable protagonist whom readers could support although he murdered thugs and civilians he never fought batman this made the joker a series in which the character s villainy prevailed over rival villains instead of a struggle between good and evil 39 because the comics code authority mandated punishment for villains each issue ended with the joker being apprehended limiting the scope of each story the series never found an audience and the joker was canceled after nine issues despite a next issue advertisement for an appearance by the justice league 38 39 40 the complete series became difficult to obtain over time often commanding high prices from collectors in 2013 dc comics reissued the series as a trade paperback 41 when jenette kahn became dc editor in 1976 she redeveloped the company s struggling titles during her tenure the joker would become one of dc s most popular characters 39 while o neil and adams work was critically acclaimed writer steve englehart and penciller marshall rogers s eight issue run in detective comics 471 476 august 1977 april 1978 defined the joker for decades to come 31 with stories emphasizing the character s insanity in the laughing fish the joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own expecting copyright protection and is unable to understand that copyrighting a natural resource is legally impossible 32 35 42 43 englehart s and rogers work on the series influenced the 1989 film batman and was adapted for 1992 s batman the animated series 35 44 rogers expanded on adams character design drawing the joker with a fedora and trench coat 36 englehart outlined how he understood the character by saying that the joker was this very crazy scary character i really wanted to get back to the idea of batman fighting insane murderers at 3 a m under the full moon as the clouds scuttled by 17 modern age years after the end of the 1966 television series sales of batman continued to fall and the title was nearly cancelled although the 1970s restored the joker as batman s insane lethal archenemy it was during the 1980s that the batman series started to turn around and the joker came into his own as part of the dark age of comics with mature tales of death and destruction the shift was criticized for moving away from tamer superheroes and villains but comic audiences were no longer primarily children 45 31 several months after crisis on infinite earths launched the era by killing off silver age icons such as the flash and supergirl and undoing decades of continuity 46 frank miller s the dark knight returns 1986 re imagined batman as an older retired hero 47 and the joker as a lipstick wearing celebrity 36 48 who cannot function without his foe 49 the late 1980s saw the joker exert a significant impact on batman and his supporting cast in the 1988 89 story arc a death in the family the joker murders batman s sidekick the second robin jason todd todd was unpopular with fans rather than modify his character dc opted to let them vote for his fate and a 72 vote plurality had the joker beat todd to death with a crowbar this story altered the batman universe instead of killing anonymous bystanders the joker murdered a core character this had a lasting effect on future stories 50 51 written at the height of tensions between the united states and iran the story s conclusion had iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini appoint the joker his country s ambassador to the united nations allowing him to temporarily escape justice 52 alan moore and brian bolland s 1988 graphic novel the killing joke expands on the joker s origins describing the character as a failed comedian who adopts the identity of the red hood to support his pregnant wife 25 53 unlike the dark knight returns the killing joke takes place in mainstream continuity 54 the novel is described by critics as one of the greatest joker stories ever written influencing later comic stories including the forced retirement of then batgirl barbara gordon after she is paralyzed by the joker and films such as 1989 s batman and 2008 s the dark knight 55 56 57 grant morrison s 1989 arkham asylum a serious house on serious earth explores the psychoses of batman the joker and other rogues in the eponymous facility 58 59 the 1992 animated series introduced the joker s female sidekick harley quinn a psychiatrist who falls for and ends up in an abusive relationship with the joker becoming his supervillain accomplice the character was popular and was adapted into the comics as the joker s romantic interest in 1999 60 in the same year alan grant and norm breyfogle s comic book anarky concluded with the revelation that the titular character was the joker s son breyfogle conceived the idea as a means to expand on anarky s characterization but o neil by then the editor for the batman series of books was opposed to it and only allowed it to be written under protest and with a promise that the revelation would eventually be revealed incorrect however the anarky series was cancelled before the rebuttal could be published 61 the joker s first major storyline in the new 52 dc comics 2011 reboot of story continuity was 2012 s death of the family by writer scott snyder and artist greg capullo the story arc explores the symbiotic relationship between the joker and batman and sees the villain shatter the trust between batman and his adopted family 19 62 capullo s joker design replaced his traditional outfit with a utilitarian messy and disheveled appearance to convey that the character was on a mission his face surgically removed in 2011 s detective comics vol 2 1 was reattached with belts wires and hooks and he was outfitted with mechanics overalls 63 the joker s face was restored in snyder s and capullo s endgame 2014 the concluding chapter to death of the family 64 65 the conclusion of the 2020 joker war storyline by writer james tynion iv and artist jorge jiménez sees the joker leave gotham after batman chooses to let him die 66 this led to a second ongoing joker series beginning in march 2021 with tynion writing and guillem march providing art 67 character biography the joker has undergone many revisions since his 1940 debut the most common interpretation of the character is that of a man who while disguised as the criminal red hood is pursued by batman and falls into a vat of chemicals that bleaches his skin colors his hair green and his lips red and drives him insane the reasons why the joker was disguised as the red hood and his identity before his transformation have changed over time 17 the character was introduced in batman 1 1940 in which he announces that he will kill three of gotham s prominent citizens although the police protect his first announced victim millionaire henry claridge the joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face batman eventually defeats him sending him to prison 68 the joker commits crimes ranging from

joker sometimes i remember it one way sometimes another if i m going to have a past i prefer it to be multiple choice 6 70 a story about the joker s origin appeared in detective comics 168 february

waste when his heist is thwarted by batman emerging with bleached white skin red lips green hair and a permanent grin 94 95 this story was the basis for the most often cited origin tale moore s one

the experience too traumatic batman shadow of the bat 38 in which joker s failed stand up performance is shown death of the family 95 and batman three jokers which asserts that it is the canon origin story 96 other stories have expanded on this origin pushback suggests that the joker s wife was murdered by a corrupt policeman working for the mobsters 97 and payback gives the joker s first name as jack 95 the ending of batman three jokers establishes that the joker s wife did not actually die rather she fled to alaska with the help of gotham police and batman because she feared her husband would be an abusive father the police then told the joker a story about her dying to protect her the miniseries also reveals that batman knows the joker s identity and has kept it secret in order to protect the criminal s wife and son 96 however the joker s unreliable memory has allowed writers to develop other origins for the character 95 case study a paul dini alex ross story describes the

the long lived jester of an egyptian pharaoh as batman says like any other comedian he uses whatever material will work 101 alternative versions main article alternative versions of joker a number of alternate universes in dc comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the joker in which the character s origins behavior and morality differ from the mainstream setting 102 the dark knight returns depicts the final battle between an aged batman and joker others portray the aftermath of the joker s death at the hands of a number of characters including superman 74 103 still others describe distant futures in which the joker is a computer virus or a hero trying to defeat the era s tyrannical batman 104 in some stories the joker is someone else entirely flashpoint portrays batman s mother martha wayne becoming the joker after being driven mad by her son s murder 105 and in superman speeding bullets lex luthor becomes the joker in a world where superman is batman 106 characterization renowned as batman s greatest enemy 107 108 109 110 the joker is known by a number of nicknames including the clown prince of crime the harlequin of hate the ace of knaves and the jester of genocide 109 111 during the evolution of the dc universe interpretations and versions of the joker have taken two main forms the original dominant image is that of a psychopath 112 with genius level intelligence and a warped sadistic sense of humor 113 114 the other version popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series is an eccentric harmless prankster and thief 115 like other long lived characters the joker s character and cultural interpretations have changed with time however unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense more than any other comic book character the joker thrives on his mutable and irreconcilable identities 116 the joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long tailed padded shoulder jacket a string tie gloves striped pants and spats on pointed toe shoes sometimes with a wide brimmed hat this appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series the batman placed the joker in a straitjacket it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit 115 the joker is obsessed with batman the pair representing a yin yang of opposing dark and light force although it is the joker who represents humor and color and batman who dwells in the dark 117 no crime including murder theft and terrorism is beyond the joker and his exploits are theatrical performances that are funny to him alone spectacle is more important than success for the joker and if it is not spectacular it is boring 118 although the joker claims indifference to everything he secretly craves batman s attention and validation 119 32 the character was described as having killed over 2 000 people in the joker devil s advocate 1996 despite this body count he is always found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to arkham asylum avoiding the death penalty 120 121 many of the joker s acts attempt to force batman to kill to the joker the greatest victory would be to make batman become like him the joker displays no instinct for self preservation and is willing to die to prove his point that anyone could become like him after one bad day 122 the joker is the personification of the irrational and represents everything batman opposes 123 personality joker co creator jerry robinson in 2008 he conceived the joker as an exotic enduring archvillain who could repeatedly challenge batman the joker s main characteristic is his apparent insanity although he is not described as having any particular psychological disorder like a psychopath he lacks empathy a conscience and concern over right and wrong in arkham asylum a serious house on serious earth the joker is described as capable of processing outside sensory information only by adapting to it this enables him to create a new personality every day depending on what would benefit him and explains why at different times he is a mischievous clown or a psychopathic killer 124 in the clown at midnight batman 663 april 2007 the joker enters a meditative state where he evaluates his previous selves to consciously create a new personality effectively modifying himself for his needs 125 the killing joke in which the joker is the unreliable narrator explains the roots of his insanity as one bad day losing his wife and unborn child and being disfigured by chemicals paralleling batman s origin in the loss of his parents he tries and fails to prove that anyone can become like him after one bad day by torturing commissioner gordon physically and psychologically 29 54 batman offers to rehabilitate his foe the joker apologetically declines believing it too late for him to be saved 71 other interpretations show that the joker is fully aware of how his actions affect others and that his insanity as merely an act 117 comics scholar peter coogan describes the joker as trying to reshape reality to fit himself by imposing his face on his victims and fish in an attempt to make the world comprehensible by creating a twisted parody of himself englehart s the laughing fish demonstrates the character s illogical nature trying to copyright fish that bear his face and not understanding why threatening the copyright clerk cannot produce the desired result 35 126 the joker is alternatively depicted as sexual and asexual 127 in the dark knight returns and arkham asylum a serious house on serious earth the joker is seductive toward batman it is uncertain if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the joker is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis frank miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships while robinson believed that the joker is capable of a romantic relationship 127 his relationship with harley quinn is abusively paradoxical although the joker keeps her at his side he heedlessly harms her for example throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives harley loves him but the joker does not reciprocate her feelings chiding her for distracting him from other plans 128 snyder s death of the family describes the joker as in love with batman although not in a traditionally romantic way the joker believes that batman has not killed him because he makes batman better and he loves the villain for that 62 129 batman comic book writer peter tomasi concurred stating that the joker s main goal is to make batman the best that he can be 130 the joker and batman represent opposites the extroverted joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos while the introverted monochromatic batman represents order and discipline the joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with batman in 1994 s going sane the villain tries to lead a normal life after batman s apparent death only to become his old self again when batman reappears in emperor joker an apparently omnipotent joker cannot destroy batman without undoing himself since the joker is simply the joker he believes that batman is batman with or without the costume and has no interest in what is behind batman s mask ignoring opportunities to learn batman s secret identity 74 131 given the opportunity to kill batman the villain demurs he believes that without their game winning is pointless 119 the character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power his criminality is designed only to continue his game with batman 84 the joker is portrayed as having no fear when fellow supervillain scarecrow doses him with fear toxin in knightfall 1993 the joker merely laughs and says boo 132 the villain has been temporarily rendered sane by several means including telepathic manipulation by the martian manhunter 71 and being resurrected in a lazarus pit an experience typically inducing temporary insanity in the subject at these moments the joker is depicted as expressing remorse for his crimes 133 134 however during a medically induced period of partial sanity in batman cacophony he tells batman i don t hate you cause i m crazy i m crazy cause i hate you and confirms that he will only stop killing when batman is dead 135 136 skills and equipment the joker s lapel often holds an acid spraying flower the joker has no inherent superhuman abilities 137 he commits crimes with a variety of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor tipped playing cards rolling marbles jack in the boxes with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building the flower in his lapel sprays acid and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items 30 138 however his chemical genius provides his most notable weapon joker venom a liquid or gaseous toxin that sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter higher doses can lead to paralysis coma or death leaving its victim with a ghoulish pained rictus grin the joker has used venom since his debut only he knows the formula and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals another version of the venom used in joker last laugh makes its victims resemble the joker susceptible to his orders 32 68 139 140 the villain is immune to venom and most poisons in batman 663 april 2007 morrison writes that being an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments the joker s immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse 141 115 the character s arsenal is inspired by his nemesis weaponry such as batarangs in the joker s utility belt 1952 he mimicked batman s utility belt with non lethal items such as mexican jumping beans and sneezing powder 138 in 1942 s the joker follows suit the villain built his versions of the batplane and batmobile the jokergyro and jokermobile the latter with a large joker face on its hood and created a joker signal with which criminals could summon him for their heists 142 the jokermobile lasted for several decades evolving with the batmobile his technical genius is not limited by practicality allowing him to hijack gotham s television airwaves to issue threats transform buildings into death traps launch a gas attack on the city and rain poisoned glass shards on its citizens from an airship 143 144 the joker is portrayed as skilled in melee combat from his initial appearances when he defeats batman in a sword fight nearly killing him and others when he overwhelms batman but declines to kill him 145 he is talented with firearms although even his guns are theatrical his long barreled revolver often releases a flag reading bang and a second trigger pull launches the flag to skewer its target 138 146 although formidable in combat the joker s chief asset is his mind 104 relationships see also list of batman family enemies the joker s unpredictable homicidal nature makes him one of the most feared supervillains in the dc universe the trickster says in the 1995 miniseries underworld unleashed when super villains want to scare each other they tell joker stories 147 148 gotham s villains also feel threatened by the character depending on the circumstances he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome 149 the joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose batman whether he is on the streets or in arkham asylum he has collaborated with criminals like the penguin the riddler and two face although these partnerships rarely end well due to the joker s desire for unbridled chaos and he uses his stature to lead others such as killer croc and the scarecrow 150 the joker s greatest rival is the smartest man in the world lex luthor although they have a friendly partnership in 1950 s world s finest comics 88 later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos 151 despite his tendency to kill subordinates on a whim the joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation they are too afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at his macabre jokes 143 even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers the 2007 limited series salvation run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell because they are more afraid of him than the alternative luthor 152 batman 186 1966 introduced the joker s first sidekick the one shot character gaggy gagsworthy who is short and dressed like a clown the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement harley quinn 153 154 introduced in the 1992 animated series quinn is the joker s former arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red and black harlequin costume to join him as his sidekick and on off girlfriend they have a classic abusive relationship even though the joker constantly insults hurts and even tries to kill harley she always returns to him convinced that he loves her 154 155 the joker is sometimes shown to keep spotted hyenas as pets this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series the new adventures of batman 143 a 1976 issue of batman family introduced duela dent as the joker s daughter though her parentage claim was later proven to be false 39 although his chief obsession is batman the character has occasionally ventured outside gotham city to fight batman s superhero allies in to laugh and die in metropolis 1987 the character kidnaps lois lane distracting superman with a nuclear weapon the story is notable for the joker taking on a relative god and the ease with which superman defeats him it took only 17 pages asked why he came to metropolis the joker replies simply oh superman why not 156 in 1995 the joker fought his third major dc hero wonder woman who drew on the greek god of trickery to temper the joker s humor and shatter his confidence 157 the character has joined supervillain groups like the injustice gang and the injustice league to take on superhero groups like the justice league 158 159 literary analysis a 2015 art exhibition at the barcelona international comics convention focused on the joker celebrating the character s 75th anniversary 160 since the bronze age of comics the joker has been interpreted as an archetypal trickster displaying talents for cunning intelligence social engineering pranks theatricality and idiomatic humor like the trickster the joker alternates between malicious violence and clever harmless whimsy 161 he is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations but by a shameless and insatiable nature and although his actions are condemned as evil he is necessary for cultural robustness 162 the trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize the status quo and reveal cultural political and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore 163 however the joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself 164 the joker possesses abnormal body imagery reflecting an inversion of order the trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind 165 in arkham asylum a serious house on serious earth the joker serves as batman s trickster guide through the hero s own psyche testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the asylum to batman 166 rather than the typical anarchist interpretation others have analysed the character as a marxist opposite to batman s capitalist arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom 167 the joker rejects most authority but retains his own using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking while eliminating any that oppose him 168 in the killing joke the joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system 169 the joker rejects material needs and his first appearance in batman 1 sees him perpetrate crimes against gotham s wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison 170 batman is wealthy yet the joker is able to triumph through his own innovations 171 ryan litsey described the joker as an example of a nietzschean superman arguing that a fundamental aspect of friedrich nietzsche s superman the will to power is exemplified in all of the joker s actions providing a master morality to batman s slave morality 172 the character s indomitable will to power means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated and he is not restrained by guilt or remorse 173 joker represents the master who creates rules and defines them who judges others without needing approval and for whom something is good because it benefits him 174 he creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself unlike batman the slave who makes a distinction between good and evil and is bound to rules outside of himself such as his avoidance of killing in his quest for justice 175 the joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question how he came to be as like the superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward 176 the joker s controlling and abusive relationship with harley quinn has been analyzed as a means of the joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or batman 177 joker mirrors his identity through harley in her appearance and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her he continues to try to subject her to his control 177 when harley successfully defeats batman in mad love 1994 the joker emasculated by his own failure severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him however while harley recovers the joker sends her flowers which she accepts reasserting his control over her 178 harley s co creator paul dini describes their relationship as harley being someone who makes the joker feel better about himself and who can do the work that he does not want to do himself 179 in the 1999 one shot comic batman harley quinn the joker decides to kill harley after admitting that he does care for her that their relationship is romantic and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose 180 removing the traditional male female relationship such as in the batman thrillkiller storyline where the joker bianca steeplechase is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with harley their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation 181 cultural impact and legacy cesar romero as the joker top in the 1966 film batman based on the tv series of the same name with burgess meredith as the penguin left and frank gorshin as the riddler center the joker is considered one of the most recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture 182 183 184 one of the best comic villains and one of the greatest villains of all time 185 186 the character was well liked following his debut appearing in nine out of the first 12 batman issues and remained one of batman s most popular foes throughout his publication 187 the character is considered one of the four top comic book characters alongside batman superman and spider man 184 indeed when dc comics released the original series of greatest stories ever told 1987 1988 featuring collections of stories about heroes like batman and superman the joker was the only villain included alongside them 188 the character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of batman who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing saving lives by murdering the joker a relentless dealer of death these debates weigh the positive stopping the joker permanently against its effect on batman s character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals 122 189 190 in 2006 the joker was number one on wizard magazine s 100 greatest villains of all time 191 in 2008 wizard s list of 200 greatest comic book characters of all time placed the joker fifth 192 and the character was eighth on empire s list of 50 greatest comic book characters the highest ranked villain on both lists 193 in 2009 the joker was second on ign s list of top 100 comic book villains 194 and in 2011 wired named him comics greatest supervillain 195 complex collegehumor and whatculture named the joker the greatest comic book villain of all time 183 137 196 while ign listed him the top dc comics villain in 2013 197 and newsarama as the greatest batman villain 107 the joker s popularity and his role as batman s enemy

video games 201 as in the comics the character s personality and appearance shift he is campy ferocious or unstable depending on the author and the intended audience 19 the character inspired theme

206 the joker is one of the few comic book supervillains to be represented on children s merchandise and toys appearing on items including action figures trading cards board games money boxes pajamas socks and shoes 184 207 the jokermobile was a popular toy a corgi die cast metal replica was successful during the 1950s and in the 1970s a joker styled flower power era volkswagen microbus was manufactured by mego 143 in 2015 the joker a serious study of the clown prince of crime became the first academic book to be published about a supervillain 184 since 2012 2013 the joker has inspired a

vapid self styled provocateur who prides himself in his ability to trigger those who hold progressive viewpoints 208 the phrase we live in a society is commonly associated with the joker in memes it
