comics batman family and other appearances 1961 1988 edit barbara gordon as batgirl art by brian stelfreeze following the accusations of a homoerotic subtext in the depiction of the relationship between batman and robin as described in fredric wertham s book seduction of the innocent 1954 a female character kathy kane the batwoman appeared in 1956 as a love interest for batman 1 in 1961 dc comics introduced a second female character as a love interest for robin 1 betty kane as bat girl arrived as the niece of and robin like sidekick to batwoman first appearing in batman 139 april 1961 2 the creation of the batman family which included batman and batwoman depicted as parents robin and bat girl depicted as their children the extraterrestrial imp bat mite and the family pet ace the bat hound caused the batman related comic books to take a wrong turn switching from superheroes to situational comedy 1 dc comics abandoned these characters in 1964 when newly appointed batman editor julius schwartz judged them too silly and therefore inappropriate 3 schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed considering the batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales and restored the batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism 1 bat girl along with other characters in the batman family were retconned out of existence following the 1985 limited series crisis on infinite earths 4 however even though bat girl did not exist in the post crisis continuity a modified version of the character mary elizabeth bette kane introduced as the superhero flamebird continues to appear in dc comics publications 5 schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the batman television series of the 1960s 6 executive producer william dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of gotham city s police commissioner james gordon and that she would adopt the identity of batgirl 7 when dozier and producer howie horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new batgirl by artist carmine infantino during a visit to dc offices they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the abc television network infantino reflected on the creation of batgirl stating bob kane had had a bat girl for about three stories in the 50s but she had nothing to do with a bat she was like a pesky girl version of robin i knew we could do a lot better so julie and i came up with the real batgirl who was so popular she almost got her own tv show 8 yvonne craig portrayed the character in the show s third season 9 barbara gordon and her alter ego batgirl debuted in detective comics 359 the million dollar debut of batgirl 1967 in the debut story while driving

requested for her to appear in other titles although some readers requested that batwoman also continue to appear in publication dc responded to the fan based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in detective comics 417 1971 12 stating i d like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to batgirl these are readers who remember batwoman and the other bat girls from years back they were there because romance seemed to be needed in batman s life but thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor these hapless females are gone for good in their place stands a girl who is a capable crime fighter a far cry from batwoman who constantly had to be rescued by batman 3 batgirl continued to appear in dc comics publications throughout the late 1960s

spinal damage 46 the character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not 46 series writer gail simone stated that while the character is one of the smartest and toughest women in comics one thing the book is truly about is that the after effects of something like ptsd post traumatic stress disorder or other trauma related syndromes can strike even very smart very intellectually tough people even soldiers and cops a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books 46 she also explained the method of the character s recovery is based upon real life experiences in that some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from south africa people have been talking about this as if it s some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases barbara s spine was not severed that makes her a candidate 46

brief time during 1999 s no man s land storyline helena bertinelli assumed the mantle of batgirl after violating batman s code against extreme violence she was stripped of the mantle and returned to her alias of the huntress charlotte charlie gage radcliffe edit main article misfit dc comics after cassandra cain abandoned the role a mystery character appeared as the new batgirl in the birds of prey comic possessing superpowers the teen claimed the empty mantle in an attempt to honor the character however barbara gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role charlie gage radcliffe acquiesced but modified her costume and changed her name to the misfit cultural impact edit while barbara gordon and cassandra cain have both been the subject of academic analysis regarding the portrayal of women in comics commentary on barbara gordon s batgirl has focused on her character s connection to the women s liberation movement doctoral degree and career as a librarian while analysis of cassandra cain s batgirl has focused on the character s double minority status as a woman and a person of color since her debut in dc comics publication and fueled by her adaptation into the batman television series in 1967 barbara gordon s batgirl has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons 84 author brian cronin in was superman a spy and other comic book legends revealed 2009 notes that following her 1967 debut batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and yvonne craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young ms gordon 27 in 2011 ign ranked barbara gordon 17th in the top 100 comic books heroes 85 cassandra cain s batgirl has become one of the most prominent asian characters to appear in american comic books and her understated sexuality is notable as being contrary to the common sexual objectification of female characters especially those of asian descent 28 feminist interpretations edit in the late 1950s and early 1960s before the feminist revolution schwartz s leading ladies included a reporter iris west in the flash a lawyer jean loring in the atom and even the head of an aircraft company carol ferris in green lantern shiera hall was merely a secretary at the midway city museum but as hawkgirl she was a police officer on her native planet thanagar and an equal partner to her husband hawkman carter hall in their superheroic exploits then there was zatanna bravely traversing the dimensions in her search for her missing father as chronicled in the recent dc trade paperback zatanna s quest barbara gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian but her transformation into batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s moreover by the 1970s barbara had given herself a makeover even in her civilian identity and ran for congress peter sanderson ign 2005 86 in the supergirls fashion feminism fantasy and the history of comic book heroines 2009 author mike madrid states that what set barbara gordon as batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime fighting unlike batwoman who preceded her she wears his symbol on her chest but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden 10 because of the fact she does not pursue a romantic interest in batman batgirl is a female batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime the same way he would a male 10 historian peter sanderson observed that barbara gordon s batgirl reflected the women s liberation movement of the 1960s 86 during the 1980s barbara kesel after writing a complaint to dc comics over the negative portrayal of female characters was given the opportunity to write for barbara gordon in detective comics robin anne reid in women in science fiction and fantasy overviews 2009 wrote that kesel s version of batgirl established her as a character separate from batman and robin a woman motivated to do what men do but alone and in her own way her secret origins 1987 and batgirl special 1988 countered the victimized and objectified presentation of barbara gordon batgirl in alan moore s acclaimed the killing joke 1988 87 she notes that kesel s interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence technological skill and ability to overcome fear gail simone included the character s paralysis in a list of major female characters that had been killed mutilated and depowered dubbing the phenomenon women in refrigerators in reference to a 1994 green lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend s mutilated body in his refrigerator 28 simone highlighted the gender difference regarding the treatment of batman and batgirl regarding paralysis by stating that b oth had their backs broken batman broke his in a dramatic batcave confrontation with the villain bane batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the joker never given a chance to fight less than a year later batman was fine batgirl now named oracle was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years 26 in superheroes and superegos analyzing the minds behind the masks 2010 author sharon packer wrote that a nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to gordon s accident is advised to consult the source material calling the work sadistic to the core 88 brian cronin noted that many readers felt the violence towards barbara gordon was too much and even moore in retrospect has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out 27 jeffrey a brown author of dangerous curves action heroines gender fetishism and popular culture 2011 noted the killing joke as an example of the inherent misogyny of the male dominated comic book industry in light of the relatively unequal violence female characters are subjected to 89 while male characters may be critically injured or killed they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage 89 reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated if audiences had grown tired of batgirl it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly 87 despite views that present the character s batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment a long held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of batman rather than standing alone as leader such as wonder woman who had no pre existing male counterpart 90 in analyzing stereotypes in gender jackie marsh noted that male superheroes such as batman are depicted as hyper masculine and anti social while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names such as the batgirl character 91 representation for librarians edit in the image and role of the librarian 2002 wendi arant and candace r benefiel argue that batgirl s portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for united states congress barbara gordon is seen as being given a career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up 11 in the essay librarians professionalism and image stereotype and reality 2007 abigail luthmann views the character less favorably stating that t he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low visibility disguise for her crime fighting alter ego and while her information locating skills may have been useful to her extra curricular activities no direct examples are given 92 representation for asian americans edit while many fans were outraged when dc comics turned cassandra into a villainess it does gel with notions of asian women as not just mysterious and exotic but also as deceitful and dangerous that cassandra s turn to villainy is linked with her mother the sexy and deadly modern dragon lady implicitly aligns her ethnic heritage and her gender with the most negative connotations of orientalism jeffrey a brown dangerous curves action heroines gender fetishism and popular culture 2011 89 the cassandra cain version of batgirl depicted as a biracial character half white and half chinese is notable as one of the most prominent characters of asian descent to appear in american comic books jeffrey a brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects however in the case of batgirl cassandra s racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent 89 the fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women and asian women in particular 89 the most controversial aspect of her character came about during the one year later event when she is reintroduced as a villain the abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership 93 when questioned about the change in characterization writer adam beechen stated they didn t present me with a rationale as to why cassandra was going to change or a motivating factor that was left for me to come up with and them to approve and we did that but as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction i honestly couldn t answer 38 in other media edit see also barbara gordon in other media yvonne craig as batgirl portrayed by yvonne craig the character s first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of batman 1967 barbara gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and batman in the second season episodes batman s waterloo and the duo defy les daniels in batman the complete history 2004 wrote that the goal of abc was to attract new audience members especially idealistic young girls and less high minded older men 6 according to craig i used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew i could ride my own motorcycle i realized they hired me because i had a cartoon voice 6 a shared criticism of batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later such as wonder woman and the bionic woman is that she was not allowed to engage in hand to hand combat on screen 84 as such her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent s face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use 84 however craig has also stated i meet young women who say batgirl was their role model they say it s because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do and sometimes better i think that s lovely 94 during the early 1970s craig portrayed batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women 90 since batman the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media 90 as batgirl barbara gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series voiced by jane webb in the batman superman hour 1968 melendy britt in the new adventures of batman 1977
