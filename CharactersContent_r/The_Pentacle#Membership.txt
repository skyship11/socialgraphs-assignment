the phantom stranger who opened a doorway to the bubble for them to enter and for them to find out what was going on the pentacle was taking over a small part of a town and was using the residents as human sacrifices to complete a spell used by strega as soon as the shadowpact entered the bubble nightshade ran into a member of the pentacle sister shadow and the two quickly fought 1 meanwhile the rest of the pentacle became aware of the shadowpact s presence and the two groups began to fight each other during each fight it was shown that the pentacle mirrored the shadowpact while all members of the pentacle took down their counterparts each one was to not kill them and to bring their unconscious shadowpact member to strega so they could imprison them however only one member of the pentacle karnevil didn t follow orders instead of bringing his counterpart detective chimp to strega karnevil tied him to a post and prepared to torture him 2 when karnevil returned to strega without detective chimp strega demanded that he retrieved chimp so they could put him with the rest of his teammates when karnevil returned to the post detective chimp had escaped and then he easily subdued karnevil then another member of the pentacle the white rabbit felt disgusted by strega s ways of killing so he freed the shadowpact enchantress took him out however knowing that he still couldn t be trusted while enchantress and nightmaster thought of a spell to destroy the barrier the rest of the team excluding detective chimp took down the remaining members of the pentacle when detective chimp finally caught up with the three enchantress spell took effect which had burst the barrier after the shadowpact discovered strega had gotten away they realized that the whole time they were in the barrier a year had passed by in the world outside of it causing each of them to age one year all due to enchantress spell 3 blue devil then sent jack of fire to hell with his trident while nightshade
