a confrontation with wally west grodd increases most of the animals brain power in central city he hopes to endanger all the humans lives but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal

adversaries for the teen titans savage approaches grodd offering him membership in this new anti titans group known as tartarus and promises of power and immortality grodd joins tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the h i v e mistress addie kane as savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality their schemes are thwarted when the titans intervene tempest later leads a rescue mission to save omen from savage during the rescue attempt tartarus collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda because omen had purposely chosen members

to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the earth in son of ambush bug 5 november 1986 he travels to the late cretaceous to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream despite the fact that the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well his plans are shattered by the sudden appearance of titano and ambush bug waking from a nightmare whether or not grodd s plan is a failure is disputable in the final issue of captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew grodd travels to earth c in an attempt to conquer but is defeated by the efforts of the zoo crew plus changeling of the teen titans 9 in the 1991 angel and the ape limited series grodd is revealed as the grandfather of sam simeon angel s partner this is in conflict with martian manhunter vol 2 annual 2 1999 which states that simeon is grodd s brother in the justice league of america wedding special gorilla grodd is among the villains seen as members of the injustice league unlimited during the final night grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the heart of darkness normally effective only in eclipses that brought out the inner beast of humans turning the population of the town of leesburg into feral monsters including supergirl however supergirl was eventually able to fight off grodd s influence allowing her to oppose grodd until the sun was restored grodd is assumed killed when an icicle fell into him one of grodd s widest ranging schemes was to arrange solovar s assassination and manipulate gorilla city into war against humanity with the aid of a shadow cabinet of prominent gorillas called simian scarlet in the course of this grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla 10 he has since recovered and a failed attempt to set up a base in florida leads to his capture and incarceration in iron heights grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum he was attacked by a gang known as the vultures one of them commented on how their member iggo had the strength of a gorilla which reminded grodd of his true form suddenly changing back to his original shape and size he quickly defeated the gang making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his telepathic abilities reading the minds of the crooks he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the flash and a plan began to form in his mind grodd found another space rock identical to the one that had given him his powers and contacted hector hammond a human who had also gained similar powers grodd was able to take control of gorilla city after increasing his evolutionary abilities but was defeated once more grodd is also seen in the superman batman arc public enemies controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down superman and batman for the prize of one billion dollars offered by then u s president lex luthor despite his use of foes such as mongul solomon grundy lady shiva and nightshade batman is able to deduce the mind behind the attacks and they quickly dispose of grodd 11 he is responsible for hunter zolomon s crippling resulting in the man s transformation into the villainous zoom after trying to change the event to never have happened hunter would often think about how grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking this over with the flash 12 in birds of prey grodd makes a deal with grimm to get blockbuster an ape heart 13 in the jla classified story arc grodd and his forces attack the ultramarine corps grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed he personally eats some of the humans during the course of this incident beryl informs the team that grodd ranks number three on the latest global most wanted 14 in the salvation run mini series grodd teams up with the joker to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains 15 he kills monsieur mallah and the brain and was knocked off a cliff by the joker 16 he is seen alive and attempting to deliver payback to the joker 17 in justice league of america grodd is shown among the members of libra s new secret society and placed in the inner circle 18 in the final crisis storyline gorilla grodd was among the high ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into justifiers 19 he is sent to apprehend snapper carr and cheetah but fails 20 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe before flash makes earthfall into the super ape s midst grodd ii was crown prince of gorilla city speaking with his father king grodd about how the light that touched their fair city was destiny destiny which had once again tilted its hand and brought their culture to being but grodd rebuffs these claims stating their destiny was their own to command and that they were destined for dominance 21 the flash barry allen first encounters gorilla grodd after a trip through the speed force which strands him in their hidden community all of which just shortly after grodd has been newly crowned as gorilla king after killing his father and consuming his mind 22 the flash is hailed as a messenger spoken of in gorilla prophecy by all but grodd who sees the interloper as a threat to his ascension and designs for world conquest when told of the treachery planned by the ape elders from his most trusted general grodd led a personal execution detail in an attempt to kill barry and assume the mantle of the light bringer but the flash foils grodd s attempts by outmaneuvering him until king grodd causes the caves containing gorilla cities history to collapse upon himself knocking him unconscious allowing the flash to escape 23 after having been unearthed by general silverback while still buried beneath the rubble of the ruined cave grodd eventually recuperated after his previous battle with flash he found that he still had some followers among the ape army and would eventually slaughter most of the elders saving one needed for his invasion plans 24 grodd returns and attacks central city with an army of gorilla soldiers searching for payback against the messenger 25 after a while of waiting out the battle gorilla grodd would make his way to one of dr darwin elias s labs which contain canisters of flash s excess speed energy 26 consuming these batteries temporarily supercharges grodd s own speed force evolved physiology enabling him enough speed and power to overwhelm the flash nearly killing him 27 during the forever evil storyline gorilla grodd returns to central city during a ceremony commemorating flash between the humans and gorillas at the time when ultraman had caused an eclipse gorilla grodd brandishing several new powers courtesy of the light proceeds to take control of central city as its king and renames it grodd city 28 eventually growing bored with this grodd uses his heightened abilities to take off the rest of his apes following him to parts unknown dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 grodd is the one who founded the terrorist organization called the black hole and he is using technology that could contain the power of the speed force in addition he also mind controlled fast track into operating as negative flash 29 30 since he is defeated by the flash with his plans of controlling the speed force foiled he has been recruited by lex luthor who promised him incredible power to paralyze people s movements called the still force which was released due to the shattering of the source wall 31 it also enabled him to act as a guardian of turtle 32 powers and abilities edit grodd s psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control and transfer his consciousness into other bodies grodd also has on occasion vast telekinetic abilities ranging from force beams telekinetic transmutation of matter and lifting thousands of tons mentally in recent issues he has shown the ability to absorb intelligence through the consumption of human brains he possesses great superhuman strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla he is a scientific genius who has mastered gorilla city s advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own he also uses large laser guns 4 33 his thought process still operates at a relatively human speed the flashes have shown some degree of immunity to his telepathic illusions by moving so fast that their thoughts process grodd s illusions in slow motion in one story grodd either gains or strengthens his already vast psychokinetic abilities via ingesting a pill he develops after evolving himself into a human enabling him to control the forces of nature but after he turns back he loses this power as his brain is not evolved enough in later stories however grodd has been seen using both his psionic attributes openly without the need of accelerated evolution in the new 52 reboot of dc continuity grodd like all the super apes of gorilla city gained their powers from the light the gorillas identifying term for flash s speed force the very embodiment of which represents relative space and time being of noble blood king grodd is tougher stronger quicker and far more physically and mentally dynamic than other members of his evolved species he boasts enhanced gorilla strength enough to easily rend flesh from bone pick up and or smash cars and injure flash through his speed aura being durable enough to resist supersonic punches from the flash rip his way out of barbed wire unharmed and even survive impacts from a charging mammoth affected by the speed force 24 34 he has sharp enough reflexes to keep up with even the most nimble meta humans with relative ease as he was able to grasp at flash more than once while he was running having intercepted many of his high speed attacks more than once another facet to his physiology is that he along with other apes like him can assimilate both the knowledge and powers of enemies who they kill by devouring their brains a process dubbed by their forefathers as cerecorbis this process increases grodd s intelligence bestowing him with a super genius iq on top of whatever memories his vanquished enemies had as well as any abilities they might have possessed 35 via direct ingestion of the light s energies he gains enhanced speed and further augmented dynamism enabling him to not just effortlessly keep up with but outright overpower flash in a straightforward fight although this augmentation was short lived as the speed force batteries he drained to get his jump were a finite source causing him to shrivel and weaken over time thanks to his time trapped within the force dimension however grodd gained an even greater acceleration of his development not only retaining his previous abilities of bolstered strength and super speed but also accelerating his developmental process granting him telepathy much like what his species elders grow into with age as well as telekinesis which is unique to him 28 for a brief time grodd s connection to the light had dimmed due to an infraction of clashing timelines but he would again regain his abilities after having siphoned the lion s share of barry allen s speed force abilities after contracting a fatal illness 29 establishing his connection to the speed force and strengthening his formidable psionic abilities once again 30 after joining luthor s legion of doom grodd would come into all new powers thanks to acting as the guardian of the turtle s latest life incarnation 31 now acting as a crucible to channel the infant turtle s still force powers grodd can now use that same hidden energy to further bolster his telepathy as well as sap energy from other speed force conduits inhibiting their ability of rapid motion to an unknown extent on top of grinding universal expansion to a standstill using its power over entropy 32 other versions edit antimatter universe edit gorilla grodd has a counterpart on the post crisis antimatter universe s earth

accomplishments since they prove far too easy for him and often lets his enemies live hoping for them to become greater challenges in the future he also decides to begin a campaign to control europe
