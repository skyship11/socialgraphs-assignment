seems to keep the ravens around out of some sort of unspoken need for companionship though he also sends them on occasional missions matthew s word balloons and font style are scratchy and uneven probably to represent a hoarse cawing voice and perhaps as an indicator of his crude smart aleck personality underneath his frequently irreverent manner matthew is actually very loyal to dream and he

not paradise it is not heaven it is the silver city that is not part of the order of created things although the silver city is often identified as heaven in the lucifer comic book series in that series one of the critical turning points is the presence s abandonment of his creation which leads to a large number of problems including struggles to claim the power that the creator has abandoned

age he is bald and has come to resemble his father very closely his relationship with mcguire is deep and heartfelt but his obsessions with his father and with dream eventually come to rule his life in the wake he appears again as the child that we see in his first appearance alex is in many ways a tragic figure perhaps the first statement of the theme that desire explores in the wake the bonds of family bind both ways had alex not been born the son of his father inheriting the imprisoned dream his life might have been much happier however he is finally able to find some measure of fulfillment in his old age following dream s death his name almost certainly derives from anthony burgess s a clockwork orange the protagonist of which is named alex but could also be a nod to
