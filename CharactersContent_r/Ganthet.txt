former green lantern after murdering sinestro and goes to earth he appears before kyle rayner and hastily hands him the ring muttering you shall have to do 3 guy gardner later claimed that ganthet

earns the respect of ganthet by facing parallax without his ring 5 the quintessence edit ganthet became part of the circle of gods including usually shazam zeus highfather and phantom stranger committed to observing the universe and counseling one another 6 ion and the new guardians edit when rayner briefly became the godlike ion he possessed more power than hal jordan did as parallax 7 realizing that he could not continue as ion without losing his humanity kyle traveled to the recently restored oa to recharge the central power battery by doing so he created a new set of guardians this time as small children both male and female with the intent that ganthet as their father figure will look after them and teach them how to be better guardians than their predecessors volume issue

manhunter reverted to the burning martian identity that the guardians of the universe had locked away long ago and attacked the justice league ganthet teleported john stewart to safety and treated his injuries when the rest of the league teleported to the fortress of solitude to escape the burning s initial attack 8 ganthet was later able to tell john the history of the burning martians and teach him a way to reroute his mind to think in the first language of the universe so that he could rescue his teammates from fernus in a hit and run attack although the intensity of this method of thought meant that john could not use it for more than sixty seconds without burning his mind out allowing them to come up with a plan to defeat fernus 9 green lantern rebirth edit ganthet played a crucial role in resurrecting hal jordan who was revealed to be possessed by the fear entity parallax during green lantern rebirth following the return of hal jordan all the guardians are aged to adulthood and are just as cold and manipulative as before the only change is that there are now female guardians as well as male ganthet of course still retains a sense of individuality amongst the guardians believing that they should retain their emotions sayd is the only other guardian who shares his mindset volume issue needed sinestro corps war edit during the sinestro corps war he and sayd are banished from the council for embracing emotions discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other 10 just as parallax freed from any hosts attacks the lanterns for freeing kyle rayner ganthet and sayd arrive and draw parallax into four separate lanterns hal guy john and kyle s respectively reasoning that the earth lanterns had proven their superior ability to overcome fear and the division would prevent anyone from being able to release parallax again as ganthet explains he and sayd were kicked out of the guardians of the universe ganthet s final act as guardian is offering kyle his power ring he asks if kyle is willing to downgrade himself to a normal green lantern which kyle quickly accepts the four men then take their lanterns and hearing the sinestro corps oath recite the classic green lantern oath and depart to confront sinestro s corps 11 ganthet and sayd also explain to the four about the emotional spectrum created at the start of the universe that is separated into seven colors green willpower yellow fear violet love red rage indigo compassion orange greed and blue hope each representing different forms of emotion with green being the most center balanced of the energies the further at one end an energy color is the wilder its power is to control the energy ends up corrupting its user ganthet also reveals that in the coming future each color will have its own forces like the lantern corps and these forces will fight against the others in a battle across the universe that will lead into the event known as the blackest night the worst of the hidden prophecies of the book of oa 12 blackest night edit main article blackest night at the end of the sinestro corps war ganthet and sayd are currently living on the planet odym they harness the blue energy of hope and make plans to create another intergalactic police force in order to aid the guardians and the green lantern corps in their upcoming battle against the blackest night the first of the blue lanterns is an alien named saint bro dee walker or saint walker the second is warth an elephant like alien from sector two according to saint walker warth will select another candidate from a different sector of space and the process will continue from there 13 later ganthet reveals to the blue lantern corps that he and sayd are planning to create an alliance to those who wield the indigo power of compassion along with oa 14 however ganthet sayd and the blue lanterns find themselves being attacked by agent orange as the villain seeks the powers they possess larfleeze desires anything he does not have 15 they were eventually rescued by hal jordan accompanied by carol ferris sinestro and indigo tribe member indigo 1 16 ganthet and sayd then seek atrocitus and larfleeze s aid to recreate the white light of creation with their saviors in order to get larfleeze to cooperate with them sayd offers her servitude to agent orange who expresses a desire of having his own guardian over ganthet s protests ganthet and sayd later arrive at coast city with the lanterns to aid earth s heroes they also try to free the guardians from the black central battery 17 18 failing that ganthet duplicates hal jordan s ring and places it on his own finger inducting himself into the green lantern corps he and sayd also duplicate the other lantern rings allowing the other six corps to gain temporary deputies to fight alongside the seven already present until the rest of the corps can arrive as a result barry allen becomes a blue lantern lex luthor becomes an orange lantern scarecrow becomes a sinestro corps officer nscientist ray palmer becomes an indigo tribesman mera becomes a red lantern and wonder woman after being freed from the influence of her black lantern ring becomes a star sapphire 19 brightest day edit main article brightest day after the blackest night is over ganthet is seen plotting with guy gardner and atrocitus a new universe saving plan against a new hidden foe to further advance his new cause ganthet renounces his guardian status requesting his fellow oans to fill in the permanent post of green lantern of sector 0 forging his own lantern and power ring in the process notably his new power battery lacks the ordinary rounder design and looks much similar to the squared older ones once wielded by the manhunters and the halla s 17 he was later forced to assist hank henshaw who has learned from the hidden foe that ganthet is apparently the key to henshaw s permanent death 20 by threatening to make the alpha lanterns kill themselves if ganthet does not cooperate henshaw made ganthet operate several alpha lanterns to try and restore them to organic life forms believing that the process once perfected can be used to return him to a mortal body 21 during the process some alpha lanterns perished ganthet experiences great grief at the death of these green lanterns emotions he is not quite familiar with ganthet was rescued by a squad of lanterns and hank henshaw s form and spirit were destroyed afterward all the alpha lanterns have their free will restored as well thanks to ganthet sadly they must keep their cyborg appearances 22 ganthet brings up more blood which transforms into atrocitus head who reveals their alliance ganthet is forced to admit to his fellow lanterns that a short time ago that formed into a tapestry of future events and that having learned that atrocitus had the same thing happen to him he and guy entered into their alliance 23 war of the green lanterns edit main article war of the green lanterns with krona having returned parallax to the green lantern power battery and infecting the other six remaining guardians with the other emotional entities ganthet kilowog and the four earth based green lanterns are the only ones even partly immune to parallax s influence due to their prior experience under his influence but he is still forced to take john and kyle s rings when they are driven to attack each other unfortunately when ganthet takes their rings and his own the three rings explode destroying his hand forcing john to bandage the amputated limb with the other green lanterns searching for them ganthet orders john and kyle to depart while he uses his own guardian based powers to draw the lanterns away 24 despite the odds against them the four earth lanterns were able to rescue ganthet from krona using the rings of the other six corps hal wielding sinestro s ring guy wielding atrocitus s ring john indigo 1 s ring and kyle wielding saint walker s ring ganthet later advising hal and guy to use larfleeze and carol s rings respectively to remove parallax from the central power battery to free the other green lanterns from his influence 25 ganthet was also able to help guy master both of his rings by encouraging him to tap into something that he loved and something that he hated 26 afterward ganthet is visited by saint walker who restores his hand his blue ring shows ganthet an image of sayd revealing that he still misses her 27 the new 52 edit following the war of the green lanterns storyline to compensate for the new shortage of guardians the other guardians strip ganthet of his emotions so that he will rejoin their ranks 28 kyle rayner comes to oa for help after something has turned him into a ring magnet causing rings from the other six corps to try and latch on to him kyle likens ganthet s transformation to a lobotomy though ganthet himself disputes this because my cognitive abilities are unimpaired kyle then compares the process to taking away ganthet s soul as he is now nothing more than another guardian a charge to which ganthet does not respond 29 after kyle is briefly overwhelmed by the other rings he wields kyle s green ring throws ganthet aside when he attempts to remove it as the other lanterns attempt to help kyle saint walker appeals to ganthet for help but ganthet simply throws walker off now regarding the blue lantern corps as a mistake that must be rectified 30 ganthet s dismissive attitude towards his past remains even when sayd is revealed to be accompanying larfleeze s attack although he appears to retain a degree of affection for kyle as he offers kyle a chance to return to the green lantern corps if he agrees to remain on oa so that the consequences of his temporary period wielding the other six rings can be studied however hearing sayd tell him that the ganthet they knew will be gone forever if kyle goes with him now kyle rejects ganthet and escapes with the other ring wielders stating that while he may consider ganthet a father he has to do things his way 31 it is later revealed that ganthet told the other guardians that during his time as a green lantern he found the corps like the manhunters has serious flaws because of the disobedience of green lanterns like hal jordan or sinestro and announces that it is time to replace the green lantern corps with the third army 32 although the new guardians go their separate ways when it is revealed that sayd brought them together by drawing rings from weaker wielders to kyle rayner due to his connection to ganthet 33 kyle is apparently still trying to recruit other ring wielders together in an attempt to rescue ganthet and restore him to what he was even as ganthet himself states that he considers the guardians as having saved him rather than the other way around 34 ganthet arrives on zamaron to attack kyle he nearly kills him with his blasts while the third army invades the zamaron homeworld but the injured kyle transforms into the white lantern having mastered the seven powers of the emotional spectrum due to his refusal to give up on ganthet helping him master the violet power of love when ganthet witnesses kyle being able to destroy the third army he becomes horrified and flees while the group will apparently be able to stop the guardians threat 35 when the first lantern volthoom is freed as ganthet and the guardians of the universe tried to use the third army to destroy the sentient beings 36 he imprisons the guardians on the planet maltus and restores their emotions to their original state ganthet comes to feel shame for his actions and for his battle with kyle 37 in the final battle after volthoom is destroyed by hal jordan and nekron the guardians are freed but are executed by a parallax empowered sinestro he spares only ganthet and reunites him with the still living sayd citing his reasons as being that he knows what it is like to lose everything but exiles them both from oa 38

their exile has ended when a green power ring arrive on the planet nok asking them to find hal jordan 41 ganthet and sayd realized hal s life is in peril so they summoned kyle rayner to save his life

the green light of pure willpower and the need of forging a new green ring he told hal that the green lantern corps has returned while they arrived at the base of mogo and reunited it 44 while the green lantern corps are reinstated ganthet and sayd assign hal and kyle to find saint walker 45 after they brought saint walker back to the base of the green lantern corps 46 they called kyle to test his white lantern power which they believed could bring the resurrection of the blue lantern corps when saint walker attempted a psionic link to kyle s power he was prevented from doing so by an unknown presence which caused kyle s white lantern power to shut down leading to his return as a green lantern 47 later ganthet and sayd were attacked and kidnapped by the controllers 48 they wanted to harvest sayd s power to empower the controllers which horrified ganthet four green lanterns of the earth however were able to locate the controllers base at sector 3001 and attacked 49 after the controllers were defeated ganthet announced that sayd will return as the guardians of the universe including the templar guardians as new members for that will be their legacy 50 other versions edit

the enemy attacking ganthet was nekron who had destroyed virtually all other life in their universe ganthet sacrificed himself to initiate the last light protocol and send the last rings and ring
