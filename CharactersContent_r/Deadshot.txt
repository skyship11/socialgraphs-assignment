and when to remove this template message deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional as long as he has been paid to kill someone he will always carry it out without exceptions batman was unable to get him to stop threatening a witness by threatening deadshot or his family deadshot rightly assumed that batman was bluffing however batman ultimately does get deadshot to abort the hit by freezing his client s bank accounts unable to get paid deadshot publicly cancelled the assassination letting the witness go free perhaps his most defining trait is his acknowledged death wish which often manifests as him deliberately engineering situations likely to kill him this makes him unpredictable as an opponent as his willingness to die allows him to deliberately injure himself to achieve a goal for example during identity crisis he deliberately shoots himself in the neck while fighting kyle rayner so that rayner would attempt to save him and drop his guard allowing lawton to take aim and almost shoot him he often expresses disappointment at surviving his missions such as immediately lamenting damn when awakening in a hospital in his run on suicide squad john ostrander delved into deadshot s past and family background the revelation of deadshot having a brother whom he idolized seemed to resonate with deadshot s attachment to rick flag team leader ostrander implied that this relationship also colored deadshot s rivalry with batman whom deadshot had always been unable or subconsciously unwilling to kill he is known to be sarcastic and profane often cursing whenever
