assigned a human buddy a corporal named mac in three stories from star spangled war stories 101 103 joe and mac end up fighting the war that time forgot against prehistoric creatures and a giant german robot soldier on dinosaur island mac edit star spangled war stories 125 introduced another g i robot this one with a visible mouth nicknamed mac and his human partner reed as part of the war era suicide squad a top secret ranger outfit specially trained for missions no ordinary soldier was expected to survive in this story the first g i robot and its human buddy are described as having

professor thompson of mit in weird war tales 101 it is deployed to a pacific island alongside the marines to fight the japanese military and placed under the control of sergeant coker although the

trust 1 j a k e 2 edit j a k e 1 is destroyed in weird war tales 111 but is replaced by j a k e 2 which continues to fight on various pacific islands including dinosaur island it later teams with the creature commandos j a k e 2 and the creature commandos are presumed killed when the rocket they are riding to berlin misfires and heads into deep space weird war tales 124 the creature commandos are known to have survived but j a k e 2 s fate is unknown the dc comics encyclopedia describes j a k e 2 as having survived into the 31st century 1 however the creature commandos later gained possession of an entire army of mass produced j a k e s it is still unknown whether one of them is the original j a k e 2 2 j a k e 6 1 edit in checkmate vol 2 24 a new g i robot is revealed with the designation j a k e 6 1 it is one of the organization s rooks a team of four elite operatives of last resort apparently constructed using the original world war ii era programming it has a new body made of components formerly used by the industrialist murderer maxwell lord during a time when his consciousness was contained in an android form lord job edit a new g i robot of unknown origin appears in the 2008 2009 the war that time forgot miniseries written by bruce jones where it is known as lord job but calls himself joe this version can speak and has bright red eyes but is otherwise of a similar appearance to the earlier models particularly joe it has not been established from which time period it comes powers and abilities edit the g i robots are all fully autonomous mechanical soldiers capable of making decisions and adapting to changes in their environment joe responds to spoken commands as well as the sound of weapons fire and machines and in situations where voice commands are impractical to light signals flashed on its control panel mac responds similarly but appears to be smarter and has no control panel no built in weapons are apparent but both are capable of using firearms like an ordinary soldier and can withstand direct fire from small arms j a k e s 1 and 2 are also armor plated models their left arms consist of a fully functional machine gun which can fire bullets mini torpedoes and small anti aircraft missiles they can also fly for short distances thanks to small rockets in their boots j a k e 6 1 unlike its predecessors can communicate verbally appears to have a sophisticated artificial intelligence system and is equipped with various weapons including a minigun as its left arm an automatic grenade launcher mounted on its right shoulder and magnetically accelerated anti personnel caltrops deployed from its chest cavity its role during missions is to monitor its fellow rooks who are telepathically linked thanks to an alien dna infusion derived from starro the conqueror if j a k e determines the dna is gaining control it will terminate the link by killing its teammates lord job is also capable of speech and has some degree of superhuman strength and resilience he does however seem to be completely artificial with no sign of a human will or even a facsimile of same unlike most of his predecessors he has shown some tactical analysis and personal combat skills he has suffered some damage before ever being seen he has not demonstrated built in weapons of any kind while j a k e 1 and 6 1 are unique beings there currently exist a whole army of j a k e 2s apparently sporting the same abilities and equipment of the original other versions edit flashpoint edit in the alternate timeline of the flashpoint event the g i robot replaces frankenstein and the creature commandos after they were deemed obsolete by robert crane s government services 3 in the modern era robert crane revives the g i robot to eliminate
