first several years of the character s existence captain boomerang spoke with an american accent beginning in the late 1980s he developed an australian accent owen mercer first appeared in identity crisis 2 2004 and was created by brad meltzer and rags morales fictional character biographies edit george digger harkness edit george digger harkness s debut as captain boomerang on the cover of flash 117 dec 1960 secretly the illegitimate son of an american soldier and an australian woman harkness was raised in an australian town called korumburra in poverty during which time he developed great skill in making boomerangs and in using them as weapons as a young adult he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was unbeknownst to him owned by his biological father it was at this time that he developed the captain boomerang persona that he would continue to use in his later criminal career 3 audiences ridiculed him and a resentful harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime when he began committing crimes he threw suspicion off himself by briefly pretending another man was impersonating him showing his parents really other crooks to the flash after the flash caught him next to a crime scene he nearly succeeded in killing the flash after knocking him out with a boomerang then tying him to a giant boomerang that he fired which then got sent into space and then fell into the ocean however the flash was able to escape from his friction proof bonds by quickly vibrating his molecules he also increased the boomerang s velocity so much he was able to use it to defeat and jail harkness and the two crooks he became a recurring enemy of the flash typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects some would explode others had razor sharp edges etc and using them ruthlessly he became a staple member of the rogues a group of villains dedicated to opposing flash and who were first organized after gorilla grodd broke them out of jail though captured when flash made their weapons hit each other they continued to act together 4 later on harkness became a less than effective member of the suicide squad in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes 4 however captain boomerang s grating personality and blatant racism among other things he constantly referred to black team member bronze tiger as an abo caused considerable friction among his teammates and he was considered to be a dangerous vicious cowardly and undependable member of the team dysfunctional even by the squad s standards and the equivalent of a class clown amanda waller the squad s commanding officer characterized captain boomerang as a jerk and a screw up this was not an undeserved reputation as among other things harkness simply watched as his teammate mindboggler was shot in the back even while he could have easily saved her mindboggler had earlier used her mind manipulating abilities on harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member he also manipulated another team member slipknot into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape unfortunately for slipknot they did he was scared to learn ifrit an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the onslaught had been created based upon mindboggler s thought patterns and revealed what had happened while in the squad harkness also briefly took up the mantle of mirror master to commit robberies 4 however this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to waller who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between mirror master and captain boomerang she rescinded the benefits harkness had been given such as his apartment in new orleans and his status as a voluntary member of the squad many times digger would have to be tricked into battle but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad convincingly managing to be other slimy criminal types later digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement hitting various members of the squad with pies for a time suspicion had been diverted from him because he had used his skills to pie himself seemingly being hit by the assailant from behind a wall when the squad confronted digger as the culprit he lost his temper and shouted that they could not really punish him since he was already in prison and in the suicide squad he asked waller what are you going to do about it fat lady waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island due to various events mainly waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down the squad broke up for a year when waller was approached again because she was needed she reformed the team and had digger picked up he was at the time trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him back to the mainland harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of australia though his countrymen do not care at all for him and a tremendous fear of being laughed at teammate deadshot commented he often wished he had killed harkness most notably after his drinking led them to miss a plane and to deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it ironically when boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to deadshot lawton s psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it harkness remained with the squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in diabloverde however despite being a somewhat trusted employee harkness still was quite amoral and greedy selling out adam cray the atom for half a million dollars digger later showed up in superboy with another squad while on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout he was shot through the hands by deadshot and apparently fell to his death he later appeared in the pages of flash with cybernetic hands alongside four other rogues they were given a chance by fellow rogue abra kadabra to become much more than they ever were unfortunately for captain boomerang captain cold mirror master weather wizard and heat wave kadabra s promise of glory was actually a ruse to free neron and empower himself neron then resurrects the five rogues superpowering them and sending them on a bloody rampage that destroys much of flash s hometown and kills thousands eventually the flash and linda park free the rogues the dead are restored to life after being restored to life boomerang and the rogues along with the trickster sought out an artifact that would protect them from neron should he ever take an interest in them again the trickster accompanied them to help an old ex girlfriend recover her kidnapped son in the end the trickster found the boy who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god but also the trickster s son he was also able to convince neron to leave the rogues alone with the rogues either coming away darker from their experiences or seeking enlightenment like heat wave who retired with the monks captain boomerang is also involved with the joker last laugh event after having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs digger is transferred by ambulance to keystone city en route the ambulance is attacked by a jokerized deadshot who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with joker s serum the serum s healing factor revives digger who is cured of his massive full body burns and ready to attack the flash at iron heights prison however once there he is choked unconscious by a jokerized pied piper captain boomerang was killed in the identity crisis miniseries by jack drake father of tim drake digger had been sent by the real killer to attack jack drake only the killer double crossed digger and sent drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself the killer later defended the action by saying that boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe digger managed to kill drake but not before he was shot himself 5 digger was later temporarily revived by agent james jesse the former trickster during the rogue war storyline when jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the rogues current hideout however jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the rogues before harkness s revival meaning that the only person present when harkness was briefly reanimated was ashley zolomon the estranged wife of hunter zolomon a former reverse flash who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with rogues during his brief return to life harkness asked ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother s real name out of fear that the rogues would kill him in the blackest night crossover his remains are reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps and he joins the reanimated jack and janet drake john and mary grayson tony zucco and the original batman s deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current batman and red robin they are met with interference from deadman who had possessed the body of etrigan the demon their attack is ultimately called off when batman and red robin cryogenically freeze themselves leaving no emotions for the black lanterns to target 6 harkness later joins other reanimated members of the rogues to target their still living members 7 however the battle results in a draw on both side harkness son owen arrives and takes him away from the battle believing he can bring his father back 8 digger convinces his son that he needs to feed upon the living in order to live so owen lures people such as newcomer villain sandblast to a pit at a construction site where digger is waiting the rogues track owen down captain cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe digger s lies when they discover the remains of a family nearby captain cold reminds owen that the rogues don t kill women or children he shoves owen into the pit where digger rips out his son s heart a black ring then flies down to make owen a black lantern the black lantern harkness and his son are then encased in ice by captain cold 9 digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and rejuvenated he appears confused as to what is going on before being knocked out by the flash 10 during the brightest day prologue digger is seen locked in his iron heights cell 11 digger is visited by tim drake whose father harkness murdered 12 tim tells him if he tries to escape he will hunt him down personally 13 he is later given a message from captain cold saying that if he wants to be one of the rogues again he has to prove it by escaping from prison on his own 14 after being beaten by guards digger is being seen to in the medical bay when he suddenly finds himself able to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on

entity proclaims captain boomerang has completed his task and his life is restored to him the entity reveals to them that the boomerang was part of a plan to free hawk from his role as an avatar of

calculator he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again during this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised owen mercer before harkness s death the two bonded taking up his father s legacy he became the second captain boomerang captain cold brother to golden glider who was believed to be owen s mother took owen in as one of the rogues 27 though owen initially had no real attachment to the rogues and even voiced various albeit short opinions out loud he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father s body had been stolen for use in a lab which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from harkness around this time the rogue war storyline began in which the reformed rogues fought the rogues under captain cold ashley zolomon is told by harkness himself he is briefly revived by the reformed rogues as part of an experiment that golden glider is not owen s real mother later it is revealed in flash 225 january 2006 that meloni thawne is the mother of owen harkness formerly owen mercer the new captain boomerang having conceived him by the original boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th century it is unknown whether she gave birth to bart allen or owen first or how owen made it back to our own time during the 2005 2006 infinite crisis storyline owen was part of alexander luthor jr s group of villains he captain cold and mirror master were sent to guard a factory against the outsiders under the command of deathstroke who was actually arsenal in disguise when the ensuing battle between outsiders and rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory the rogues and other villains would not help in the fight at all and then at the explosion he is saved by the outsiders while the rogues left them at the base to blow up he is then turned over to the authorities off panel during the 52 series owen is part of a suicide squad sent by amanda waller to attack black adam in the 2006 one year later storyline owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as iron heights there he finds himself being the cellmate of black lightning who was arrested for a murder that deathstroke the terminator committed 4 it is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of black lightning s identity and are planning to murder him the outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break pierce out of jail unfortunately it goes terribly wrong as they escape black lightning asks that they take owen with them which they grudgingly agree as they escape the outsiders jet the pequod is shot down and while the team escapes the world believes them dead because of this event and the freedom of power treaty the team now works covertly most of the current outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world his history as a rogue has been exploited several times by team leader nightwing from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned jay garrick however it is revealed that his desire to join the outsiders comes from his desire for a family nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because arsenal felt he would be worthy and because owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the rogue war owen searched out the current robin because of their connection where their fathers killed one another while robin originally believed owen was searching for him in order to finish the fight his father started in robin 152 owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero and has offered his assistance to help robin destroy a bomb created by the joker the two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains afterward robin gained a bit of civil respect for boomerang despite what their fathers did to one another boomerang attempted to shake hands with robin but robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step at some point during his tenure with the outsiders captain cold approached the mercenary deathstroke with an offer concerning owen in exchange for kidnapping deathstroke s daughter rose who had betrayed her father and joined the teen titans and delivering her to her father deathstroke would track down the outsiders and turn owen over to the rogues the villains planned to force owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind controlling agent that deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as batman s partner cassandra cain however this plan fell apart when rose escaped and helped the teen titans defeat the rogues which led to deathstroke backing out of the deal 28 owen has also developed a close friendship with supergirl kara zor el 4 after supergirl returned from her time away with power girl kara began looking to start a normal life on earth and went out a date with owen during which they spoke of their past problems kara has nicknamed owen boomer although the pair often flirts with one another they have never progressed to a romantic relationship this comes primarily from the fact that kara continues to show interest in nightwing and jokingly says that what she and owen has is more of a brother sister relationship in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his little sis feeling rejected after kara s relationship with power boy owen goes to a bar where he meets cassandra cain batgirl who at the time was being mind controlled by deathstroke the terminator and who had been hired to kill supergirl cassandra kidnaps and tortures owen to lure supergirl unfortunately this proves unnecessary as kara had tracked down cassandra on her own without any knowledge of owen s kidnapping batgirl nearly manages to defeat supergirl but is defeated when kara grows krypton sunstones which impale her foe kara then rushes owen to the hospital where he is treated while still in medical care it is discovered that power boy has been stalking kara following kara s rather violent break up with power boy the earth was overtaken by spirits from the phantom zone which began to emerge from within superman kara managed to defeat the phantoms and return the earth to normal afterwards in supergirl 19 kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth amongst them boomer to whom she apologises for letting him get hurt and leading him on during this conversation the matter of owen s relationship with kara is finally clarified when asked by kara how he feels about her leading him on owen replies well if i may for me to have been led on would presume i thought i had a shot with you for me to think i had a shot with a sixteen year old girl crystal powered hypersleep whatever junk aside that would mean i am a dirtbag with a thing for jailbait which i am not in checkmate 13 15 crossover with outsiders 47 49 checkmate abducts all members of the outsiders except nightwing allowing him to infiltrate their

nightwing hands over the team to him owen and nightwing are paired with each other in auditions for the new line up pushed too far feeling he does not need to prove himself anymore owen returns to the suicide squad although batman feels he could make a good double agent 4 in all flash 1 owen as part of the new suicide squad captures two of the rogues that are responsible for bart allen s murder heat wave and weather wizard in louisiana in countdown 39 he and the rest of the squad chase after piper and trickster in gotham city after they had escaped capture from squad member deadshot the
