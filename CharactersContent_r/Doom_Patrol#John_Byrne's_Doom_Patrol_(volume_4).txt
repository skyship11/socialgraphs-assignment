publication history edit my greatest adventure doom patrol volume 1 edit cover to my greatest adventure 80 june 1963 the first appearance of the doom patrol with art by bruno premiani doom patrol first appeared in 1963 when the dc title my greatest adventure an adventure anthology was being converted to a superhero format the task assigned to writer arnold drake was to create a team that fit both of these formats with fellow writer bob haney and artist bruno premiani he created doom patrol a team of super powered misfits who were regarded as freaks by the world at large 1 according to drake editor murray boltinoff told him my greatest adventure was in danger of cancellation and he wanted him to create a new feature which might save it 2 boltinoff was enthusiastic about drake s initial pitch with elasti girl and automaton changed to robotman by the team s third appearance issue 82 but drake wanted a third character and enlisted haney s help in coming up with negative man 2 the team was initially announced as the legion of the strange 3 doom patrol were announced on the cover art of my greatest adventure 80 cover dated june 1963 drake and haney devised the plot for the issue together and then each scripted half the issue independently drake the first half haney the second 2 doctor niles caulder motivated the original doom patrol bitter from being isolated from the world to use their powers for the greater good my greatest adventure was officially retitled the doom patrol beginning with issue 86 in an interview drake discussed the conception of doom patrol 4 murray boltinoff the editor came to me one day or i went to him one day and he said we re having a lot of trouble with my greatest adventure it s starting to lay an egg the era of the superhero has taken over completely my greatest adventure has ordinary heroes we need some kind of superhero to punch it up so i said okay went out and came back a couple of hours later with the basic idea about the man in the wheelchair who is the great brain and runs this group of superheroes who hate being superheroes that was the new aspect that was the thing that made doom patrol different these people hated being superheroes and they were a little bit self pitying just a little bit and the chief was constantly telling them stop crying in your beer that made them something that wasn t around at the time the members of the doom patrol often quarrelled and suffered personal problems something that was already common among superhero teams published by marvel comics such as fantastic four but was novel among the dc lineup 5 doom patrol s rogues gallery matched the strange weird tone of the series 2 villains included the immortality seeking general immortus the shape shifting animal vegetable mineral man and the brotherhood of evil led by the brain a disembodied brain kept alive by technology the brotherhood of evil also included the intelligent gorilla monsieur mallah and madame rouge who was given powers similar to those of elongated man with the extra attribute of a malleable face allowing her to impersonate various people cover to doom patrol 121 september october 1968 the last original issue of the series with art by joe orlando the doom patrol had two crossovers one with the challengers of the unknown teaming up to fight multi man and multi woman and second with the flash in the brave and the bold 65 as the popularity of the book waned the publisher cancelled it drake killed off the entire doom patrol in the final issue doom patrol 121 september october 1968 where doom patrol sacrificed their lives to madame rouge and general zahl to save the small fishing village of codsville maine this was the first time in comic book history that a cancelled title was concluded with the death of its cast citation needed artist bruno premiani and editor murray boltinoff appeared at the beginning and the end of the story asking fans to write to dc to resurrect doom patrol although the latter was supposed to have been arnold drake 6 according to the writer he was replaced with the editor because he had just resigned over a pay dispute and moved to marvel comics he finished the script only out of friendship for boltinoff 7 a few years later three more issues appeared reprints of earlier issues 89 95 and 90 appeared as 122 123 and 124 respectively a proper doom patrol revival did not occur until 1977 nine years after the original s demise some similarities exist between the original doom patrol and marvel comics original x men 8 marvel acknowledged the similarity in its humor title not brand echh 9 both include misfit superheroes shunned by society and both are led by men of preternatural intelligence who use wheelchairs these similarities ultimately led series writer arnold drake to argue that the concept of the x men must have been based on the doom patrol drake stated i ve become more and more convinced that stan lee knowingly stole the x men from the doom patrol over the years i learned that an awful lot of writers and artists were working surreptitiously between marvel and dc therefore from when i first brought the idea into dc editor murray boltinoff s office it would ve been easy for someone to walk over and hear that i was working on a story about a bunch of reluctant superheroes who are led by a man in a wheelchair so over the years i began to feel that stan had more lead time than i realized he may well have had four five or even six months 10 in an interview shortly before his death in 2007 drake took a more moderate position stating that while it is possible lee took his ideas from doom patrol he could also have arrived at a similar concept independently since we were working in the same vineyards and if you do enough of that stuff sooner or later you will kind of look like you are imitating each other 2 they also share the same writers such as grant morrison and john byrne as well though the doom patrol and the x men do share some similarities there are major differences such as the doom patrol tends to go on bizarre and weird adventures while the x men share their own bizarre adventures they tended to be more focus on the themes of racism prejudices and hate crimes both have stories that shows them to carry their heroics and are family oriented with internal problems that are disputed or resolved as well as finding common ground with their morals and so forth but while the x men still do heroic stories somewhat with certain social political themes the doom patrol was more centered to focus on wacky and bizarre stories more akin to the fantastic four showcase paul kupperberg s doom patrol edit writer paul kupperberg a longtime doom patrol fan and artist joe staton introduced a new team in showcase 94 august september 1977 11 dc was then lining up features for the showcase revival the series was initially an anthology that would debut new characters who could springboard into their own series if they proved sufficiently popular and showcase 94 was the first new issue of the series in almost seven years editor paul levitz instructed kupperberg and staton to do a doom patrol feature 12 kupperberg opted to create a new lineup because he wanted to respect the story in which the doom patrol met their deaths and was inspired by len wein and dave cockrum s then recent all new all different x men 13 kupperberg has since said he is not proud of the reboot remarking that i was missing the point of the doom patrol the original group were outsiders and freaks while my new guys were just comic book superheroes i was young and inexperienced and new to writing with about two years under my belt before getting the gig 12 the new team is led by celsius arani desai the chief s previously unseen wife who recreates the doom patrol to protect herself from general immortus robotman is the only survivor of the original doom patrol and his ruined body is replaced by a new futuristic one built by dr will magnus the negative spirit now possesses russian cosmonaut valentina vostok making her negative woman although its presence does not render her radioactive and she is able to transform her own body into its form rather than sending it out under control the final member is tempest aka joshua clay a vietnam veteran deserter who fires energy blasts from his hands 14 this new version of the team did not receive its own series following its three issue tryout kupperberg said this was most likely due to poor sales as even in the months prior to the dc implosion he heard no word of a new doom patrol series 12 however the team did receive a series of guest appearances in various dc titles such as superman family in a three part arc in the supergirl feature that was intended for the recently canceled super team family 15 dc comics presents teaming up with superman in a story which revealed that vostok s powers had changed to match larry trainor s exactly and supergirl robotman also appeared as an occasional supporting character in the marv wolfman and george pérez era of teen titans where it was revealed that changeling formerly dp associate beast boy had arranged for dayton industries technicians to recreate the caulder body design for cliff his first storyline here had him the titans and a new brotherhood of evil battle madame rouge and general zahl the murderers of the original doom patrol who died in the battle eclipse comics published doom patrol the official index with covers drawn by john byrne in 1984 the two part series included all of their appearances from my greatest adventure 80 to their final appearance before their 1980s return post crisis relaunch volume 2 part 1 edit kupperberg s enthusiasm for the doom patrol remained and in addition to writing some of the team s post showcase appearances he eventually wrote a proposal for a new doom patrol series 12 the proposal was green lit and kupperberg laid the groundwork for the new series by writing the john byrne illustrated secret origins annual 1 published in 1987 which recapped the origins of the two iterations of the doom patrol that had existed thus far in october 1987 dc relaunched doom patrol written by kupperberg and illustrated by steve lightle 16 lightle took on the assignment with reluctance having read and disliked kupperberg s new doom patrol in showcase 94 96 and soon quit due to several grievances such as not being involved in plotting the comic despite the editor repeatedly promising that he would be 17 he was replaced by a young erik larsen after issue 5 kupperberg later commented i like erik s work but i don t think he was exactly right for the doom patrol to tell the truth i don t think either erik or myself were happy with the arrangement but we did our best to make it work 12 for his part larsen said he was perfectly happy on the series in part because on the few occasions where he disliked an aspect of kupperberg s plots he would simply revise the plot when he drew the issue in retrospect larsen felt that this practice was overstepping his bounds but said the editor never objected to it 18 this incarnation was a more conventional superhero series than the original volume 12 it included new members who were hired to the team the magnetically empowered strong girl lodestone rhea jones karma wayne hawking whose psychic power make anyone trying to attack him fall over themselves and scorch scott fischer whose body generates phenomenal quantities of heat focused through his hands requiring him to wear protective gloves at all times a dc comics bonus book appeared in issue 9 june 1988 19 according to kupperberg sales on the series started out okay and descended to the point where i was removed from the book and replaced by grant morrison in the hopes he could salvage the title 12 grant morrison s doom patrol volume 2 part 2 edit after the first 18 issues and various crossovers and annuals kupperberg was replaced by grant morrison and the comic was no longer submitted to the cca for approval relieving the stories and images depicted of several constraints starting with issue 19 kupperberg agreed to help morrison by writing out characters morrison did not want to use celsius and scott fischer died before issue 18 celsius was killed in an explosion in dc comics invasion event and scott fischer already suffering from a recurrence of childhood leukemia was the only known active superhero casualty of the dominators gene bomb also in invasion karma had left the team as he was still on the run from the law he became a member of the suicide squad and died on his first mission with them in the war of the gods crossover event the negative spirit left negative woman s body and lodestone plunged into a coma where she would remain for the first half of morrison s run on the book tempest gave up fieldwork to become the team s physician conversely morrison picked up a throw away character from dp 14 who was slipped into the art on the last page of 18 to set up morrison s use dorothy spinner is an ape faced girl with powerful imaginary friends morrison also substantially retooled negative man larry trainor revealed to be alive in the kupperburg run as a prisoner of an underground society but now powerless is forcibly merged with the negative spirit now a cosmic entity and a black doctor named dr eleanor poole to create a multigender multiracial gestalt entity known as rebis the new writer introduced some new characters to the team including the multiple personality afflicted crazy jane and sentient neighborhood danny the street morrison used dc s invasion crossover to restart the book they incorporated bizarre secret societies elements of dada surrealism and the cut up technique pioneered by william s burroughs and brion gysin they also borrowed the ideas of jorge luis borges and heinrich hoffmann the original creator arnold drake said morrison s was the only subsequent run to reflect the intent of the original series 20 cover of doom force one shot parody of x force art by keith giffen and mike mignola over the course of the series morrison dedicated some issues to parody and homage willoughby kipling led the doom patrol on a parody of the brujería story arc of swamp thing a murder of crows in issues 31 32 issue 42 featured the origin of flex mentallo who was supposed to be the character in the charles atlas ad a belated lawsuit from the charles atlas company showed that dc was protected under fair use doctrine in addition to an expired statute of limitations 21 issue 53 featured a dream sequence that mimicked the stan lee jack kirby fantastic four borrowing plot points both from the galactus trilogy ff 48 50 and ff 51 this man this monster a 1992 special called doom force was released as a one shot and was meant to mimic and parody the x force book by rob liefeld issue 45 parodied marvel s punisher and alan moore in a satire called the beard hunter a perpetually clean shaven serial killer who murders bearded men and targets the chief morrison s villains were extremely unusual and strange even by doom patrol s eccentric standards for example red jack is a near omnipotent being who thinks he is both jack the ripper and god he lives in a house without windows torturing butterflies to create the pain he needs to survive the brotherhood of dada are an anarchistic group who fight against reality and reason it features members such as sleepwalk who can only use her tremendous powers when asleep she takes sleeping pills and listens to barry manilow before battles and the quiz who has every superpower you hadn t thought of and a pathological fear of dirt the scissormen a race of beings that attack non fictional beings in the real world i e the world the doom patrol live in with their large scissor like hands and cut people out of reality in issue 57 it was revealed that the chief had secretly caused the accidents which turned cliff larry trainor and rita farr into super beings chief stated he caused them to gain their powers or in the case of robotman destroyed his original body in order to obtain his brain to put into his robot body because of his hatred for them he felt they were spoiled and narcissistic as well as shallow individuals and that by turning them into freaks he could improve them as human beings he further revealed that he lied about not being married to celsius the leader of the second doom patrol who caulder claimed was insane lying about being married to him out of anger he was upset over how the experiments performed on her like with elasti girl only gave her super powers and did not turn her into a freak when tempest and robotman found out his role in creating robotman elasti girl and negative man tempest was killed and robotman paralyzed having been exposed as a villain caulder planned to unleash nanobots into the world hoping to create a catastrophe that would improve humanity regardless of the carnage it would cause but caulder s plan was hijacked by the candlemaker a violent cosmic horror who is freed by dorothy in exchange for his resurrection of tempest who candlemaker re killed candlemaker then decapitated caulder and sought to use the nanobots to enslave humanity dorothy crazy jane and robotman freed by the former two defeated candlemaker with help from the new reborn version of rebis rebis briefly left the team to mate with a double of himself in order to be reborn in a new body as part of a cosmic ritual however during the battle jane was sent flying into a portal and landed in a world without heroes forcibly institutionalized for her mental issues in this new world the final issue of morrison s run had robotman locate jane as she was about to kill herself and take her to live with cliff within the confines of danny the street rachel pollack s doom patrol volume 2 part 3 edit morrison left the book with issue 63 and rachel pollack took over writing the book the next issue pollack s first issue was also the first under the new vertigo imprint of dc comics although the trade paperback editions of morrison s work do bear the imprint the original issues did not returning characters for rachel pollack s run included cliff steele niles caulder kept alive by the nanobots but reduced to a disembodied head usually kept on a tray filled with ice and dorothy spinner pollack s run had dorothy as a primary member of the patrol she brought her imaginary friends to her aid in combat overall pollack s run dealt with issues such as the generation gap humanity identity transgender issues bisexuality and borrowed elements from judaism and kabbalah in the last few issues the angel akatriel is used as a major character in the last seven issues the first story arc of her run was called sliding in the wreckage cliff s computer brain started to malfunction and he regressed into flashbacks from previous storylines dorothy was haunted by african spirits while dealing with living alone in the real world the chief was given a new body by will magnus but to atone for his sins caulder ripped his head off the body and was kept in cryogenic storage meanwhile the entire earth had been suffering from random outbreaks of weirdness contributed by the arrival of something called the book of ice a government agency known as the builders similar to the men from n o w h e r e were trying to stop the outbreak which was apparently linked to a race of shapeshifters known as the teiresias as the chief was kept in a cryogenic state he appeared in the land of the teiresias as a face carved in a mountain they warned him that his arrival in this world was causing the craziness in the real world throughout the storyline little people with backward letters for heads had been seen altering people these people were apparently older version of nanomachines referred to as nannos at the doom patrol headquarters builder agents attacked and in the craziness two of the teiresias approached dorothy with a new brain for cliff but to insert it she needed the chief s expertise in the teiresias world nannos repaired the chief so he could live as a severed head after his awakening the craziness seemed to stop and dorothy cliff and the chief each realized that they needed to be together the team relocated to violet valley s rainbow estates a house haunted by ghosts of those who died in sexual accidents there three new members joined the bandage people george and marion who were once two workers for the builders but managed to escape and the inner child a manifestation of the ghosts purity and innocence another later newcomer of the team was kate godwin aka coagula one of the first transgender superheroes a one time ally of the team called the identity addict who could become different superheroes by shedding her skin like a lizard integrated herself back into the team while using the false memory identity to change the team s memories until she was kicked out by dorothy villains that the team fought besides the builders included the fox and the crow two animal spirits whose feud dorothy and cliff were subsequently pulled into the master cleaner a being with a human fetus inside a bubble for a head who began cleaning the world by stripping it down to nothing and replacing the stolen items including people with a paper ticket and a group of hassidic healers who called themselves the false healers and their leader the rabbi of darkness toward the end of the series cliff steele s brain became entirely robotic until dorothy spinner used her imaginary friends to repair it the chief would later die after trying to enter the sephirot or tree of life a new artist ted mckeever took over the artwork for most of the final 13 issues pollack continued writing the title until its cancellation with issue 87 in february 1995 john arcudi s doom patrol volume 3 edit in december 2001 writer john arcudi and artist tan eng huat launched a new doom patrol series this relaunch was not under the vertigo imprint and returned the title to the mainstream dc universe the series lasted for 22 issues before it was cancelled arcudi s run largely ignored morrison and pollack s runs at first arcudi stated in interviews at the time that the disconnect with the vertigo run was due to dc editorial having an agreement in play banning writers from using characters and concepts from his run most notably rebis negative man and crazy jane however due to negative fan response to the run arcudi was allowed to make reference to the vertigo series to explain what had happened to the characters from the pollack run the run featured two doom patrols a corporate run doom patrol employed by thayer jost for jost enterprises featuring existing dc characters metamophoro elongated man the second doctor light and beast boy and a second underground doom patrol run by robotman and featuring new characters fast forward who could look 60 seconds into the future kid slick who could become entirely frictionless fever who could set herself alight and freak who possessed mysterious powers from a patristic entity in her soul the later doom patrol were the main characters of the run with the jost owned group disbanding when it is revealed by metamorpho that robotman had reportedly died four years earlier which results in the imposter robotman in the team to vanish into nothingness 22 the doom patrol later rebuild the real robotman once they recover his head and come to an agreement that thayer jost will fund the group so long as jost has the distributing rights to the doom patrol which he uses to create a doom patrol tv series based on the silver age team over the course of the run fast forward loses control of his powers when he tries to look beyond 60 seconds into the future and has to suppress them with medicine in order to function while kid slick and fever start a relationship with one another despite the latter accidentally hospitalising the former with her powers it is later revealed that part of robotman s agreement with jost involves jost funding for dorothy spinner s healthcare as she has been in a coma for the last four years cliff deduces that the imposter robotman was an imaginary cliff that dorothy had subconsciously manifested 23 visiting dorothy cliff regained his lost memories and how dorothy became comatose deciding to end the doom patrol colagula and cliff took dorothy to kentucky to meet her previously unknown birth mother to offer dorothy a chance at a more normal life but fearing that colagula and cliff were abandoning her dorothy had an explosive psychic outburst that reportedly killed colagula and cliff and left her comatose after finding out that dorothy was permanently brain dead cliff gave the doctors permission to turn off her life support 24 the death of dorothy ended robotman s contract with jost resulting in fast forward fever kid slick and freak being evicted and striking out together with royalty money that jost gave them from his doom patrol tv series while cliff set off into the world once again alone arcudi s new characters have made very few subsequent appearances mainly constituting cameos john byrne s doom patrol volume 4 edit in august 2004 dc launched a new doom patrol series after the new team debuted in jla john byrne wrote and illustrated this series with inks by doug hazlewood touted as together again for the first time byrne rebooted the series eliminating all previous doom patrol continuity 25 the series debuted as part of a six part storyline that ran in jla 94 99 as the tenth circle though byrne only drew this arc as it was written by chris claremont this reboot was both controversial and short lived 26 besides the removal of the popular morrison run and its characters from canon and the butterfly effect it had on the teen titans which did its best to limit references to beast boy s past and avoided using the brotherhood of evil until the byrne run was canceled and geoff johns could restore the previous lore the series garnered controversy over a scene where robotman and elasti girl are sent back in time and inhabit their younger selves bodies during their time in the past robotman declares his love for elasti girl however due to an age gap between the two heroes rita is trapped in her twelve year old self s body when the adult cliff reveals his romantic feelings and kisses her dc canceled byrne s series with issue 18 the events in dc s infinite crisis crossover saw the restoration of the doom patrol s full continuity with the inclusion of all previous incarnations with the reveal that superboy prime had retcon punched the previous versions of doom patrol from existence and for him to retcon punch them back into existence after being shot with an arrow that briefly imprisoned superboy prime into a rectangular shaped mini phantom zone by speedy ii infinite crisis and one year later edit dc editorial used the events of the infinite crisis storyline to restore the doom patrol s continuity in escaping from the paradise dimension they had inhabited since the end of crisis on infinite earths superboy prime and alex luthor created temporal ripples which spread throughout reality causing overlaps on parallel timelines of certain events hypertime such as restoring jason todd to life in the reprinted edition of infinite crisis additional scenes added to the collection showed fever kid slick ava nudge grunt and vortex among a two page spread of heroes 27 while assisting the teen titans in battling superboy prime members of the doom patrol had flashbacks to their original history robotman and niles caulder regained memories of the previous doom patrol teams with which they had worked this battle apparently undid some of superboy prime s timeline changes and resulted in a timeline incorporating all previous incarnations of the doom patrol but with rita farr and larry trainor still alive the chief confirmed that rita was indeed killed by zahl s explosion the chief claimed that he later found her skull and treated it with synthetic proteins until her malleable body was regrown from it 28 steve dayton is again using the mento helmet and he is mentally unstable however he remembers his time as the crime lord the chief appears to be manipulating the doom patrol members once again he claims to wish to return them to normal so maybe one day they won t be freaks anymore after the doom patrol encounters the titans the chief tells them that kid devil should be a member of the doom patrol instead of the titans since his unique appearance and nature will always separate him from others however beast boy elasti girl and mento all stand up to the chief and force him to step down as the doom patrol s leader with mento taking over that role two former members of the teen titans were dramatically altered during the course of the infinite crisis mal duncan now code named vox and his wife bumblebee now reside in the doom patrol s castle headquarters the doom patrol later appear in the four horsemen series 2007 with caulder back in charge according to titans vol 2 1 beast boy has recently become the team leader in dc universe decisions robotman has a supporting role while mento appears in issue 4 keith giffen s doom patrol volume 5 edit on february 7 2009 it was announced at the new york comic con that keith giffen would be spearheading a revival of doom patrol a title which he has long said he wanted to write 29 30 he was joined by artist matt clark who has also long expressed a desire to work on the team 31 the new series focused on the core members elasti girl negative man robotman and the chief while other members such as mento bumblebee and vox were to be seen later the title launched with a 10 page ongoing metal men co feature written by j m dematteis 32 33 in the first issue rita takes on the alias elasti woman and according to the team shrink she s mothering bumblebee who s now eight inches tall after being shrunk rather conveniently for her codename to the size of a bee in infinite crisis nudge byrne s addition to the team was killed in the line of duty and grunt took off with her corpse the current team is working out of oolong island from 52 which has been turned into a resort town while still maintaining a large super science background the challengers of the unknown s rocky davis is also working closely with the team for spiritual support former member crazy jane appears in issue 7 danny

during their fight luthor reveals that caulder as he did in the morrison run was responsible for causing the accidents that gave the doom patrol their powers and that both celsius and joshua clay used the chaos of the events of forever evil to fake their deaths and escape from caulder it is also revealed that caulder poisoned an entire fishing village as part of an experiment and cured the
