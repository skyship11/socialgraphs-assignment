character biography edit hawk and dove edit main article hawk and dove hank hall was originally the superhero hawk of hawk and dove hawk represented chaos while dove represented order his brother don hall died during crisis on infinite earths and was replaced with dawn granger 2 armageddon 2001 monarch edit main article monarch comics monarch was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak dystopian earth fifty years in the future the people were unhappy with his rule particularly a scientist named matthew ryder an expert on temporal studies who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power he learned that forty years ago one of earth s strongest and most powerful heroes would eventually turn evil and become monarch and ten years from that event he would conquer the world during a time travel experiment matthew was transformed into a being called waverider and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become monarch not knowing that monarch was following him when monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day he killed dove and her enraged partner killed him for it removing the villain s mask hank discovered that he was monarch and donned the armor 2 the reveal of hank hall as monarch led to some controversy amongst the fan community monarch was originally intended to be revealed as captain atom with clues in the story pointing towards this which had to be discarded when it was changed at the last minute this change was due to the premature leaking of monarch s identity while monarch was always supposed to be captain atom this was supposed to be a secret when monarch s identity was prematurely leaked dc decided to preserve the surprise of the story by switching monarch s identity to that of hank hall as many fans pointed out hawk and dove vol 3 annual 2 had hank hall fighting monarch face to face in 2001 with hawk being the destroyer of monarch 3 dove allowed waverider to see a multitude of futures and realize hawk is monarch armageddon the alien agenda edit when hostile aliens encounter monarch and captain atom in the past sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago they attempt to enlist both with each figure having no knowledge of the other involved to assist them in creating a wormhole the wormhole s creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive earth existed but would allow the aliens to travel freely zero hour extant edit main article zero hour comics hank hall as extant during zero hour art by eric battle shortly after returning to the present monarch confronted waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him it is explained at this point that when monarch killed dove her powers went directly into hawk realising this monarch unleashes his hidden powers and becomes extant 4 extant then removes waverider s timetravel device and joins forces with renegade green lantern hal jordan now known as parallax in a plan to alter time as they saw fit 2 his first act was to alter the future so that he could have a metahuman army at his disposal mostly consisting of members of the teen titans his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself several armies of heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future down but not out extant began to strike back at the heroes at ground zero the beginning of time parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault and extant hit the atom with a chronal blast de aging him into a teenager sensing defeat was imminent he escaped the fight promising vengeance at a later date extant would first reappear in the 1999 one shot impulse bart saves the universe 5 in it extant picks a fight with the original justice society as a means of tricking the linear men into saving the life of an innocent bystander who was destined to die the man they saved would now go on to develop a nuclear weapon that when tested would shift the earth out of its proper orbit causing massive changes in the timelines of some of earth s greatest heroes among these changes hal jordan never becomes green lantern thus he never becomes parallax and never stops extant from destroying all of time fortunately for the citizens of time impulse arrives and is barely able to defeat extant and prevent the linear men from saving the doomed scientist he would engage the justice society again on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality warping power of the worlogog recently dismantled by hourman because he feared its power although extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of metron s stolen mobius chair doctor fate learned from the imprisoned mordru that when hourman had dismantled the worlogog he had retained a small fragment of it thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime worlogog that the jsa could exploit after the resurrected dove sacrificed herself to distract extant hourman divided his hour of power amongst his teammates thus granting them all immunity to extant s reality warping powers for four minutes each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the worlogog following this setback extant again attempted to escape instead extant was teleported by hourman and metron at atom smasher s behest into the seat of an airplane whose crash kobra had caused earlier in his relative timestream as a result of this atom smasher s mother was saved as she was on the plane when it crashed but atom smasher replaced his mother with a weakened extant saving her life but murdering the super villain to stop his threat and ensure that the same number of people died on that plane who had died originally hawk restored edit in response to fan criticism of armageddon 2001 many of whose readers felt that the character of hawk had been severely misused in the story s last minute changes dc comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended a hero dc had already retconned extant s portion of hank hall s timeline in issue 14 of jsa dated september 2000 in which metron announced his intention to erase the villain s wretched timeline with his mobius chair this was the second issue of a 3 part story entitled the hunt for extant the details of which are listed above after this dc also retconned monarch s
