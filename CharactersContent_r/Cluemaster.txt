this is cluemaster s first full appearance in the new 52 continuity 16 he is later revealed to be the final mastermind behind the systematic attack on batman by various villains inspired by an old theory he had when talking with other lower grade villains that they could take action while batman was occupied with the bigger criminals he sent out invitations to other big league foes to take action after the fall of commissioner gordon and then all he had to do was slip a basic mind control drug into gordon s coffee to make him see a threat that wasn t there and let the other villains do what they wanted guessing correctly that batman would never think to look at a small timer when so many bigger villains were playing a part in the scheme although brown manages to capture and unmask
