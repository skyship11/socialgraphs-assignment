wearing black canary s boots and trademark fishnet stockings though she hates wearing them 14 shiva continues to perform solo work and visits robin to assist him much to robin s chagrin in discovering the truth behind batgirl s recent disappearance and recent upheaval within the league of assassins she refuses to allow herself or oracle s team to be involved and instead trusts her former pupil to handle the situation it appears that she holds no ill will towards cassandra as she informs tim that she hopes that her daughter is well during a recent mission oracle s team confronts the villain prometheus whose helmet allows him to copy the skills of 30 of the world s greatest martial artists including shiva herself this had allowed him a victory against batman in the past shiva believes that his files on her would be out of date and that she would be able to defeat her old self she seems unconcerned about the skills of the other 29 fighters and apparently decides to attack prometheus
