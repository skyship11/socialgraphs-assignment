in the identity crisis miniseries vixen rejoined her justice league colleagues she was present when the original firestorm died during a battle with the shadow thief vixen adopted a new uniform in infinite crisis 7 similar to the one worn by her television counterpart on justice league unlimited one year later edit main article one year later vixen was tricked into battle in hub city by a currently intelligent solomon grundy whose rebirth came with increased intelligence 23 24 25 the totem was essential to grundy s plans he intended to use it as a catalyst to merge his perpetually reincarnating soul with the shell of the amazo android and thus gain further power grundy used the totem to increase the metahuman mimicking abilities of amazo without her totem vixen found that her innate connection to the red the essence of animal life was falling apart 26 she managed to lock onto the totem but her mind became lost in a flock of migrating birds after mimicking the abilities of a young boy vixen managed to regain her mind and quickly flew to new york to retrieve her totem 27 vixen literally dropped into the jla battle against amazo 28 after the villains were subdued vixen became a charter member of the newly revamped justice league of america 29 justice league of america edit vixen s main story arc in the early issues of justice league of america vol 2 centered around a change in her powers vixen changed from no longer drawing on animal characteristics but to drawing on the powers of those around her she matched others skill levels and as she suspected drained powers from them superman was first to catch on to this and she subsequently revealed it to red arrow 30 vixen sought out her former suicide squad teammate bronze tiger to discuss her situation and subsequently admitted everything to the league 31 chairperson black canary instructed her to hand in her credentials and removed her from the team afterward dinah discussed with mari the possibility of fixing the properties of the totem with the assistance of zatanna when zatanna attempted to find the source of the problem she saw a mystic image of vixen and animal man as puppets when she tried to break the spell she was repelled by an unknown force when vixen attempted to defeat the newly restored amazo by absorbing all his stolen powers she became mysteriously weak 32 she then fell unconscious with amazo bearing down on her 33 when zatanna and red tornado finally resolved the crisis vixen went to seek animal man since he had been affected by similar power fluctuations and was left unable to tap into the powers of earth borne animals there they were both sucked into the tantu totem where like in zatanna s vision they were trapped in anansi s net anansi the trickster god of african folklore revealed his powers and how being the king of the stories he changed buddy and mari s personal histories and sources of powers to test them 34 in an attempt to keep them contained anansi restored their connection to the red but altered the personal histories of the leaguers to prevent them from ever founding the jla however vixen escaped and sought the new leaguers to fight anansi at their side although she succeeded in gathering allies they were still no match for anansi s power vixen held a gun to her totem even though she knew that if the totem was destroyed they would all be destroyed this forced anansi to return things to normal anansi then revealed to mari that the whole thing was actually a test he explained that reality had been changed on a fundamental level and he needed someone to act as his agent against an individual who could take advantage of the situation he restored mari s powers returned her and the jla to their homes and said that he would one day call upon her 35 return of the lion edit vixen return of the lion is a limited series detailing vixen s return to her home village for the first time in that series vixen found that a local warlord named aku kwesi and his men had taken over several zambesi villages it turned out that this was the same man who killed vixen s mother years ago when vixen confronted him she found that he had powers that rivaled and possibly surpassed hers these powers were based on advanced technology and chemicals that were given to him by intergang lieutenant whisper a daire the rest of the justice league of america went to africa to render assistance only to have several members get doused with kwesi s specially prepared vodun zombie potion this allowed a daire to take control of superman and black canary and pit them against the rest of the league final crisis edit during the final crisis crossover event vixen was at the funeral of martian manhunter and later at the hall of justice when empress sparx and más y menos came there seeking help after being attacked by mirror master and arthur light she later participated in a massive battle with darkseid s forces after he nearly conquered earth with the anti life equation after final crisis edit in the aftermath of final crisis the jla was in tatters with many of its members having to leave mari and the remaining team members enlisted the aid of hardware after kimiyo hoshi went missing in her search for shadow thief and starbreaker 36 37 with help from superman s friend icon the team emerged victorious in the battle with starbreaker with mari having bright hopes for the future of the team 38 a short while later vixen broke her leg in a battle between the jla and the dangerous villain prometheus with hawkman s mace 39 while she and the rest of the team tried to recover they were ambushed by despero who sought to destroy the weakened league the jla eventually defeated despero only to be informed by zatanna of the horrific events of blackest night taking effect across the globe 40 after the black lanterns attacked 41 42 vixen told kimiyo that she was taking a leave of absence from the team in order to recover from her injuries 43 according to writer james robinson vixen was initially intended to have a significantly different exit from the team according to him issue 41 of justice league of america was supposed to have mari returning to africa in order to help defend the continent in the wake of freedom beast s murder in cry for justice eventually establishing a team of african superheroes known as the justice league of africa 44 despite no longer working with the league vixen was one of the heroes hunting down maxwell lord at the start of justice league generation lost and was presumably mind wiped by him along with most of the earth s population she and black canary later traveled to san francisco in order to help zatanna capture a group of humans who had been transformed into were hyenas 45 sometime after her resignation from the jla vixen traveled to the rundown neighborhood of liberty hill in order to recruit tattooed man for a new team of heroes she is putting together however vixen discovered that a group of gang bangers who had formerly worked under tattooed man had taken control of the community and made a fortune for themselves through crime mistakenly believing that tattooed man was responsible for the acts of violence committed by his former thugs vixen rescinded her offer and attacked him 46 after a brutal fight vixen willingly surrendered and agreed to leave and let tattooed man take care of his neighborhood in his own way 47 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe vixen was recruited as part of the new justice league international 48 her tenure with the team proved short since she was injured in an explosion and rendered comatose 49 her old friend david zavimbe later joined the team in her honor as batwing 50 after the jli disbanded vixen was seen as one of cyborg s new recruits for the main justice league roster 51 dc rebirth edit vixen is recruited by batman to join his new justice league of america vixen is later seen working on behalf of the league investigating a lead on a mysterious technology threatening america 52 powers and abilities edit due to her blood relationship to the spider god anansi vixen possesses the innate ability to make direct contact with the earth s morphogenetic field which is sometimes called the red the morphogenetic field red is a primordial force that connects all life in the universe this contact with the red allows her to draw upon the abilities of any animal that has ever lived on the planet by simply focusing on a specific animal vixen can draw its talent from the morphogenetic field and mimic its abilities giving herself a variety of superhuman powers her abilities have allowed her to channel the powers of extinct animals such as the saber toothed tiger and the triceratops domesticated animals like the doberman pinscher mutated animals like gorilla grodd and even mystical beasts like dragons 53 her powers even allow her to twist some animal abilities like when she used the bio luminescence of a marine hatchet fish and an angler fish to produce light from her hand and to create a laser like beam from her head 54 vixen can enhance the abilities of the animals she is mimicking once when her body was destroyed she used the regenerative abilities of flatworms to reconstruct her entire body within minutes 55 vixen s abilities can also be proportional to her body allowing her dramatic increase in strength and speed by using the strength of a rhinoceros beetle she was able to increase her strength 850 times 56 and while using the flight speed of a housefly she easily broke mach 2 57 vixen s connection to the red also allows her to combine the abilities of multiple animals once holding onto the morphogenetic traits of an entire forest 58 vixen s claws nails are particularly sharp and tough enabling her to rend through a variety of substances such as fabric wood cinder block and even soft metals with ease her claws are magically enhanced and have drawn blood from individuals who are considered highly resistant to damage or near invulnerable like geo force despero and pre crisis superman 4 59 occasionally she has been known to physically transform into animals for example she has shapeshifted into a gray wolf a great horned owl and a cougar 60 vixen can also assume a hybrid form in which she maintains her humanoid form but with certain animal adaptations like when she took on the gills fins and missing eyes of a blind cavefish in jsa classified and later shapeshifted into a humanoid wolf retaining the cave fish s blindness 61 vixen also has the ability to communicate with animals and can override the natural predator prey instinct found in most wild animals 62 while the full extent of vixen s control over the morphogenetic field is unknown she has on occasion drawn pure energy from it and displayed this energy as a force field and energy constructions 63 while in cooperation with animal man and the woman known as tristess she helped to create an entire universe 64 it is unknown what would happen if vixen tried to use her magical abilities on an alien animal or if she would gain access to the morphogenetic field of another planet while assisting hawkgirl during a mission on a distant planet she was able to access her abilities during the time when vixen was mimicking human abilities she was able to mimic the extraterrestrial abilities of superman this might indicate that she is able to mimic the abilities of aliens as long as she is aware of them 65 one apparent drawback of vixen s powers is that she is not always able to control the inputs from the morphogenetic field sometimes she has absorbed unwanted animal behavior such as instinctive rage or killing frenzy the longer she stays in contact with the morphogenetic field the less human and more animal she seems to become 66 vixen wears a mystic artifact called the tantu totem a fox head shaped talisman given to her ancestors by the african trickster god anansi it was previously thought that the totem was the source of her powers but later stories 67 have shown that it merely prevents the morphogenetic field from overwhelming her mind it can be assumed that the totem increased her natural mimicking range of 150 feet to worldwide as she has been seen taking on the traits of animals from around the world the full capability of the totem is unknown but vixen once used the magic of the totem to heal bruises and wounds within seconds by simply touching it 68 the power of the totem has also allowed vixen to tap into the red and make mental contact with the wishers a group of people around the world who were granted wishes by the queen of fable after losing the totem vixen was forced to tap into the human template as a way to purge herself of pure animalistic sensations and regain her humanity afterward vixen is left with a crippled connection with the morphogenetic field unable to reach any animal except the human animal in this state she shows the ability to mimic metahuman powers such as jay garrick s speed geo force s earth based powers and black lightning s elemental control as well as the kryptonian superpowers of superman an extraterrestrial 69 her abilities are not only limited to that of metahumans as she was able to duplicate red arrow s archery skills and even green lantern s ring in an issue of justice league of america suggesting that she gained powers similar to those of amazo it is revealed that this is actually trickery on the part of anansi the spider god upon confronting him within the tantu totem anansi restores vixen s animal powers for unknown reason anansi has made the tantu totem his current home and considers vixen s family the custodians and guardians of the totem while mari doesn t need to wear the totem to use her powers she is expected to keep it safe for anansi other versions edit flashpoint edit in the alternate
