well as spontaneously generating enormous amounts of ice snow and cold in his earliest appearances his gun produced a mind paralysis ray which could effectively freeze opponents cognition and motor responses as well as scramble their thoughts 13 the minister is capable of propelling himself through the air by using his gun to materialize ice slides which rapidly form beneath and behind his feet similar to the marvel comics mutant superhero iceman additionally the gun appears to be able to formulate moving constructs made of ice and vapor not unlike the hydrokinetic abilities of the dc comics superhero mera though imposing his advanced technology is not his only formidable weapon the minister has consistently demonstrated a cunning capacity for deceitful manipulation whether abusing his position as majordomo by misleading the regent of the icy kingdom from which he hails wholly duping his criminal accomplices captain cold and icicle i or deluding followers as a cult leader minister blizzard s affinity for calculating control has proven as dangerous as his ice gun other versions edit justice league adventures edit based in the dc animated universe minister blizzard is part of a
