marvel characters in 1972 relaunching them in a new title shazam the following february the characters 20 year absence from publication was explained as the result of doctor sivana and the sivana family having trapped the marvels their friends other superheroes and by accident themselves in a sphere of suspendium due to sivana jr distracting doctor sivana by slapping him on the back in congratulation and making him crash the spaceship into the suspendium sphere a compound that kept them in suspended animation from 1953 until 1973 they were released when the suspendium sphere neared

children were grown and earth not so backward as when he left it since his children were adults by 1940 his departure from earth would implicitly have been the late 1910s or early 1920s during his

would disable all radio communications permanently he tried to extort 50 million only to be stopped by captain marvel in his first adventure cap broke through the window of the building where sivana was hiding and defeated the guards binding them securely with tubing ripped from the radio silencer 12 sivana planned to kill captain marvel with a blast from his atom smasher but cap leaped back out the window and escaped during the fight sivana s returning army angrily asked why captain marvel had defeated them in their war against america despite their highly advanced weaponry 13 sivana

venus disguising himself as professor xerxes smith 14 sivana s henchmen bound and gagged batson and sivana tried to take away his memory using a memory mangler billy regained his memory after stumbling into the cave of shazam and accidentally saying the word shazam sivana s henchmen rebelled against him and set off an explosion that destroyed the mangler ironically captain marvel saved sivana and his daughter beautia who the henchmen had left to die 15 sivana continued to nurse a megalomaniacal grudge against humanity and also a personal enmity with the marvel family this persisted
