eclipso first appeared in house of secrets 61 august 1963 and was created by bob haney and lee elias 3 4 fictional character biography edit originally eclipso was written as a generic villain with average superpowers who would routinely enact an elaborate plot to fulfill his hedonistic motivations however the 1992 darkness within miniseries modified the character to be an evil and megalomaniacal entity eclipso s character laments the power he once had as a spirit of divine vengeance eclipso would frequently seek to possess beings of incredible power like superman lar gand and captain marvel to achieve his ends bruce gordon edit eclipso s early comics debut is tied to his first modern host bruce gordon named after bruce wayne and commissioner gordon as an inside joke 5 a scientist specializing in solar energy while in the jungle to view a solar eclipse gordon was attacked by a tribal sorcerer named mophir before plunging to his death off a cliff mophir wounded gordon with a black diamond afterwards gordon transformed into the villainous eclipso whenever an eclipse occurred a blue gray or purple circle covered the rightmost two thirds of his face resembling a partial eclipse 6 gordon experienced many jekyll and hyde transformations and misadventures in the house of secrets during this period eclipso was portrayed as a conventional villain possessing super strength partial invulnerability and eye blasts aided by his black diamond eclipso s transformations were later altered so that any type of natural eclipse lunar or solar would cause eclipso and gordon to split from one another while an artificial eclipse an object blocking out a light source would merely transform gordon to eclipso any bright flash of light would banish eclipso back into bruce gordon s body or reverse the change 7 eclipso the darkness within edit main article eclipso the darkness within wonder woman possessed by eclipso art by joe quesada in the early 1990s dc retconned eclipso in a company wide crossover built around the miniseries eclipso the darkness within eclipso was revealed not simply to be bruce gordon s dark half but a vengeance demon who had possessed gordon eclipso s soul had originally been bound inside a giant black diamond called the heart of darkness in africa a treasure hunter found it in the late 19th century and brought it to london in 1891 where he had a jeweler cut it into 1 000 shards this weakened the binding spell allowing eclipso to possess anyone who became angry while in contact with one of the shards he was no longer limited to possessing gordon during an eclipse but pretended otherwise so that gordon would not know the truth about the black diamonds 3 over the next 100 years the eclipso entity gathered the diamond shards with the intention of destroying them all freeing his true power when lar gand discovered eclipso s palace on the moon and wandered inside it inspired eclipso to possess all of earth s heroes and use them towards his ultimate goal the conquest of earth and revenge against god for imprisoning him inside the heart of darkness eclipso claimed he had spent the last several years posing as a b level villain in order to remain undetected by earth s heroes and had limited himself to targeting gordon for the purpose of quashing gordon s research into solar science if gordon had achieved his goal of making solar energy the planet s primary energy source any solar powered device could be used as a weapon against eclipso in the climax of the story several of earth s heroes were possessed by eclipso and transported to the moon during an eclipse he then absorbed these heroes into his own body gaining their mass and also their inherent powers gordon led a group of heroes armed with solar weapons to the moon in an attempt to defeat eclipso once and for all the absorbed heroes were freed in the end but only after will payton destroyed eclipso s moon base by detonating his own solar powered body eclipso s diamond shards however remained on earth eclipso series edit following the crossover event eclipso appeared in a solo series he conquered the south american country of parador by possessing one person at a time the united states sent an investigation team consisting of cave carson bruce gordon and gordon s fiancé mona bennet carson s legs were broken and he was left at the border gordon and bennet were taken on a tour and shown various atrocities such as piles of children s corpses they escaped with the assistance of the creeper and formed a group of heroes dubbed the shadow fighters this group was led by amanda waller formerly of the suicide squad in issue 13 of the series eclipso defeated them killing wildcat ii the second doctor mid nite the creeper commander steel the manhunter iv a mark shaw ringer and major victory the creeper has returned to action in his own series 3 the peacemaker was also involved in this action he died in a helicopter crash while trying to destroy eclipso s tanks these tanks were attacking the sole surviving member of the shadow fighter attack force nemesis the other survivors of the shadow fighters those who had not attacked eclipso directly regrouped eclipso attacked them with a parador missile which they evaded using nightshade s teleportation ability during the escape mona s father was snatched from their vehicle but he later returned alive the survivors arrived in the united nations building just in time to foil another plot of eclipso by landing their vehicle on his intended victim bruce gordon and mona bennet led earth s superheroes in an attack on parador in an attempt to destroy eclipso once and for all eclipso revealed that he dares not kill gordon and bennet because their unborn child will time travel to the past as an adult and free eclipso from the diamond eclipso was finally defeated when the phantom stranger gathered all 1 000 black diamond shards and fused them back together into the heart of darkness imprisoning eclipso again his physical body the adult child of bennet and gordon evaporated in front of his parents the spectre vol 3 edit later in the 1990s the series the spectre vol 3 gave key revelations about eclipso the spectre was not the first embodiment of the wrath of god but was eclipso s replacement series writer john ostrander chose to portray this as a distinction between the spectre s pursuit of vengeance and eclipso s pursuit of revenge in a biblical context eclipso was responsible for noah s flood while the spectre was the angel of death who slew the first born egyptian children the spectre destroys the heart of darkness along with the remains of eclipso s palace on the moon burning them to ash with the holy power of god and casting the ashes into outer space alex montez edit alex montez as eclipso art by john watson eclipso returns after several years absence in the princes of darkness storyline in jsa as an ally of the other villains mordru and obsidian alexander montez cousin of wildcat ii vows revenge on eclipso for her death to this end he gathers the 1 000 black diamonds liquefies them and injects them into himself all save one which he keeps to evoke eclipso exactly how eclipso s diamonds had returned was unknown montez covers his body in tribal tattoos he claims he had learned about on diablo island with these tattoos montez can summon all the powers of eclipso by triggering the diamond with his anger while remaining in control of himself and keeping eclipso trapped within as the new eclipso he joins the short lived team of loose cannon heroes assembled by black adam which was the subject of the subsequent storyline black reign during adam s reign in kahndaq alex becomes romantically involved with his teammate soseh mykros the female nemesis during the battle one of alex s binding glyphs which keeps eclipso in control is broken via a shoulder wound eclipso soon kills nemesis alex commits suicide in order to prevent eclipso from controlling him further this story was significant as it meant that eclipso no longer had a limitless number of black diamonds waiting out in the world for him to utilize

possess superman by antagonizing him through many deaths 8 he eventually possesses superman by upsetting him via his possession of lois lane 9 at this point the wizard shazam steps in by sending captain marvel to fight the possessed eclipso superman thanks to superman s weakness to magic captain marvel is able to do a significant amount of damage to eclipso a prominent method of attack he uses is to continuously trigger his transformations in close proximity to superman resulting in the lightning striking eclipso 10 eventually shazam himself removes eclipso from superman by calling upon the hostless spectre himself to do it the spectre forces eclipso back into a lone black diamond the spectre then warns shazam that he has made an enemy of eclipso and that the currently hostless

diamond and that the psycho pirate delivered it to loring on alex s orders and manipulated eclipso into manipulating the spectre this was all done in the interest of breaking down magic into raw
