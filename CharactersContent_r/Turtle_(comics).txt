fast they were moving during the infinite crisis the turtle man is part of the secret society of super villains led by alexander luthor jr posing as lex luthor using his speed stealing abilities to negate the power of speedsters and thus make it harder for the heroes to track the society 4 still force entity edit in scott snyder s justice league series the turtle is revised as believing in an opposing energy to the speed force known as the still force each time he accessed this power it aged him now a hatchling described as the fourth generation of his line he is finally attuned to the still force and grants gorilla grodd now a member of lex luthor s legion of doom total control of it to combat the flash 5 his origin was elaborated on with growing up in an abusive household but this didn t stop his intellect from shining the boy graduated from school far earlier then any of his classmates and quickly became a leading scientist one day he met a woman and fell in love the boy married this woman and had two children a boy and a girl the scientist spent most of his time with his family slowing down his scientific advancements and allowing his peers to surpass him 6 growing jealous of his peers the scientist began experimenting with a mysterious energy force that he believed kept the universe moving forward in his jealousy the scientist rushed the experiments hoping to prove his genius again his experiment quickly meandered out of control and the scientist was caught in an explosion the explosion accelerated the scientist s age giving him the body of a feeble old man furthermore his movement was slowed and he stopped aging physically or mentally his family helped him through the recovery process and soon enough he could once again move like his old self however he still kept the appearance of an old man he experimented with this energy force for decades discovering he could negate any form of motion including the progression of life eventually he became disillusioned with human life as he knew that he would outlive everyone he loved this led him to kill his family with his powers as he saw them as a needless distraction from his work eventually he began going by the name turtle most likely because of the motion negating powers he now possessed jai west edit in the pages of flash forward jai west is a manifestation of wally west s
