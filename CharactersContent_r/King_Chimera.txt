was not well perceived by his teammates however king did not seem to care as he stated that he was not with the justice society to make friends 16 only a few months later still early in his publication history king s attitude began to slowly change in the jsa all stars series beginning right after his near death experience with johnny sorrow he started to transition from his harsh attitude to a respected teammate he also started to show more respect towards his teammates by helping them out more with their problems specifically with judomaster while she was dealing with the
