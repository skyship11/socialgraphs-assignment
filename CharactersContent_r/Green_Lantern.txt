spoke to him and said it would bring power from this he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers the limitations of the ring were that it had to be charged every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood alan scott fought mostly ordinary human villains but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal vandal savage and the zombie solomon grundy most stories took place in new york as a popular character in the 1940s the green lantern featured both in anthology books such as all american

lawman green arrow as a liberal iconoclast additionally during this run the groundbreaking snowbirds don t fly story was published issues 85 86 in which green arrow s teen sidekick speedy the later grown up hero red arrow developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit the stories were critically acclaimed with publications such as the new york times the wall street journal and

states patent and trade mark office the first in 2012 and the second in 2016 16 fictional character biographies edit golden age green lantern edit alan scott edit main article alan scott alan scott s green lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical green flame meteor fell to earth in ancient china the voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times once to bring death a lamp maker named luke fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp in fear and as punishment for what they thought to be sacrilege the local villagers killed him only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame once to bring life in modern times the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life and once to bring power by 1940 the lantern passed into the possession of alan scott a young engineer following a railroad bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor the flame instructed scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero green lantern he adopted a colorful costume and became a crimefighter alan was a founding member of the justice society of america after the crisis on infinite earths although the original origin story was still in continuity a later tales of the green lantern corps story was published that brought scott even closer to the corps ranks when it was revealed that alan scott was predated as earth s green lantern by a green lantern named yalan gur a resident of china not only had the corps now familiar green black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted but yalan gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen power ultimately corrupted this early green lantern as he attempted to rule over mankind which forced the guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood the material from which most earth weapons of the time were fashioned this allowed the chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted champion his ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the intelligence inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the guardians was damaged over time when it had occasion to manifest itself this intelligence became known as the mystical starheart of fable centuries later it was explained when scott found the mystical lantern it had no memory of its true origins save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master this was the origin of scott s distinctive costume due to its damaged link to them the guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record thus scott was never noticed by the guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the corps sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood honoring this separate history the guardians never moved to force scott to relinquish the ring formally join the corps or adopt its colors some sort of link between scott and the corps however was hinted at in a silver age crossover story which depicts scott and hal jordan charging their rings at the same power battery while both reciting the brightest day oath during the rann thanagar war it was revealed that scott is an honorary member of the corps on june 1 2012 dc comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of alan scott as a gay man in the title earth 2 the new 52 issue was released on june 6 2012 17 in its story alan scott and his partner sam were both passengers aboard a train but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad bridge collapse that scott alone survived a magical green flame found alan amongst the rubble telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame s great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend becoming green lantern this alternate version is not a member of the green lantern corps which does not exist in earth 2 but rather adopts the name green lantern for himself for his mystical powers derive from the green the elemental force which connects all plant life on earth silver age green lantern edit hal jordan edit main article hal jordan the character of harold hal jordan was a second generation test pilot having followed in the footsteps of his father he was given the power ring and battery lantern by a dying alien named abin sur whose spaceship crashed on earth abin sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was utterly honest and born without fear to take his place as a member of the corps at one point when hal jordan was incapacitated it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on earth the other being guy gardner and the ring chose jordan solely because of his proximity to abin sur gardner then became listed as hal s backup even though he had a strong friendship with barry allen the flash gardner would fill in if jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated later when gardner was put into a coma it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task john stewart who was designated as the earth sector s backup lantern jordan as green lantern became a founding member of the justice league of america and as of the mid 2000 s is along with john stewart one of the two active duty lanterns in earth s sector of space jordan also automatically became a member of the green lantern corps a galactic police force which bears some similarities to the lensmen from the science fiction series written by e e smith although both creators julius schwartz and john broome denied ever reading smith s stories 18 nevertheless the early 1980s miniseries green lantern corps honors the similarity with two characters in the corps eddore of tront and arisia following the rebirth of superman and the destruction of green lantern s hometown of coast city in the early 1990s hal jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the green lantern corps and the central power battery now calling himself parallax hal jordan would devastate the dc universe on and off for the next several years however after earth s sun was threatened by a sun eater jordan sacrificed his life expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the spectre the divine spirit of god s vengeance whom jordan attempted to transform into a spirit of redemption which ended in failure in green lantern rebirth it is revealed that jordan was under the influence of a creature known as parallax when he turned renegade parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the central power battery by the guardians of the universe in the distant past imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten becoming known merely as the yellow impurity in the power rings sinestro was able to wake parallax and encourage it to seek out hal jordan as a host although parallax had been trying to corrupt jordan via his ring for some time it was not until after the destruction of coast city that it was able to succeed it took advantage of jordan s weakened emotional state to lure him to oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way after killing several green lanterns jordan finally entered the central power battery and absorbed all the power unwittingly freeing the parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul the spectre bonded with jordan in the hopes of freeing the former green lantern s soul from parallax s taint but was not strong enough to do so in green lantern rebirth parallax began to assert control of the parallax spectre jordan composite thanks to a supreme effort of will jordan was able to free himself from parallax rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring the newly revived and rejuvenated jordan awoke just in time to save kyle rayner and the green arrow from sinestro after the korugarian s defeat jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow green lanterns in battle against parallax and with help from guardians sayd and ganthet imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of earth s lanterns rendering the green lantern s rings free of the yellow impurity provided they had the power of will to do so hal jordan is once again a member of both the justice league and the green lantern corps and along with john stewart is one of the two corps members assigned to sector 2814 personally defeating sinestro in the sinestro corps war jordan is designated as green lantern 2814 1 post sinestro corps war dc comics revisited the origin of hal jordan as a precursor to the blackest night storyline the next chapter in the geoff johns era on green lantern hal jordan is the green lantern portrayed by ryan reynolds in the 2011 green lantern film bronze age green lanterns edit guy gardner edit main article guy gardner character in the late 1960s guy gardner appeared as the second choice to replace abin sur as green lantern of sector 2814 gardner was a candidate to receive abin sur s ring but jordan was closer this placed him as the backup green lantern for jordan but early in his career as a green lantern tragedy struck gardner as a power battery blew up in his face putting him in a coma for years during the crisis on infinite earths the guardians split into factions one of which appointed a newly revived gardner as their champion as a result of his years in a coma guy was emotionally unstable although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly he has gone through many changes including wielding sinestro s yellow guardian power ring gaining and losing vuldarian powers and readmission to the corps during green lantern rebirth he later became part of the green lantern honor guard and oversees the training of new green lanterns gardner is designated as green lantern 2814 2 within the corps guy gardner helped lead the defense of oa during the events of blackest night following his outstanding acts of valour the guardians appoint guy to a unique role and highest rank in the green lantern corps sentinel answering directly to the guardians themselves john stewart edit main article john stewart character in the early 1970s john stewart an architect from detroit was selected by the guardians to replace a comatose guy gardner as the backup green lantern for jordan when jordan resigned from the corps for an extended period of time stewart served as the regular lantern coming into his own as he battled numerous green lantern

other they married but katma was soon murdered by longtime green lantern villain star sapphire stewart was crushed by this and his life began to unravel he reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet xanshi from destruction during the cosmic odyssey john stewart redeemed himself during the mosaic crisis when an insane guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on oa when the guardian was defeated the cities remained as the other guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the central power battery to send them home while they gathered the resources john stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities using his intellect and unconventional thinking he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society he was aided by rose hardin a farmer from west virginia who was trapped on oa due to her town being abducted stewart once again found love with rose and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on earth stewart eventually deduced that the guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted and that they let them remain on oa as an experiment in cosmic integration and also as a test for john stewart stewart passed the test and discovered that he was a figure in oan prophecy that was why the guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a power ring to do it as is standard procedure john stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal guardian of the universe he was also rewarded with the resurrection of katma tui which caused him to break up with rose stewart s new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when hal jordan went mad and became parallax absorbing the power from the central power battery during this time the green lantern corps was disbanded and stewart went on to lead the darkstars a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the controllers offshoots of the guardians of the

stewart fended off fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body which was in him due to hal jordan healing his crippling condition however this left him unable to walk again stewart later visited fatality while she was in custody and she revealed to him that his back was fine and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to

failing to save her world in the events leading up to the uprising fatality was captured by shape shifting durlans and a durlan operative replicated her and took her place john stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship but he eventually came to love fatality but it turned out that it had been the impostor at that point in the final battle of the uprising the impostor revealed itself as verrat din an eons old durlan and destroyed fatality s star sapphire ring having no use for it after gaining the power of a daxamite though stewart defeated the powerful threat he was shaken by having been misled for so long and having been intimate with a durlan shapeshifter stewart immediately set out to find the real fatality and when he did he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the star sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them when her ring was destroyed the spell was broken every moment she

using the power of the entire green lantern corps he was responsible for the rebirth of the guardians and the re ignition of the central power battery essentially restoring all that jordan had destroyed as parallax kyle rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear and parallax had been released from the central power battery ganthet knew this and chose kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist parallax because parallax is a manifestation of fear and yellow none of the other green lanterns including hal could harm parallax and therefore came under his control kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat parallax and incarcerate him in the central power battery once again kyle became ion who is later revealed to be

the child s mother was extremely grateful to vicker making him realize that their physical differences hid how similar the aliens were to mankind vicker would later use his skills as an actor to teach the natives of his sector the great plays of earth when an invasion force threatened his sector following the first destruction of the central power battery the now depowered vicker raised and trained a resistance group that eventually repelled the invaders and ensured his adopted people s freedom vicker later joined john stewart s darkstars he was killed during the battle with grayven third son of darkseid keli quintela edit young justice vol 3 1 march 2019 introduced keli quintela as teen lantern an unofficial green lantern quintela is an 11 year old from la paz bolivia who receives a green lantern power gauntlet similar to krona s from a dying green lantern that she then modifies and hacks to act like a green lantern power ring powers and abilities edit main article power ring dc comics the ring is powered by willpower each green lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities the full extent of the ring s ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light early green lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring from shrinking objects to turning people invisible later stories de emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs the signature power of all green lanterns is the ability to conjure constructs solid green objects that the green lantern can control telekinetically these can be anything such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe a shield to block an attack a sword to cut a rope or chains to bind a prisoner whatever their shape or size these constructs are always pure green in color unless a lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the em spectrum the construct emits hal jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under batman s guidance the rings of the green lantern corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe they allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment and also remove the need to eat sleep and pass waste the rings can translate practically any language in the universe they possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects lanterns are granted full access to all guardian knowledge by their rings through the book of oa a noteworthy power the rings do not have is the ability to automatically heal injuries though they can provide shielding in hal jordan s origin story abin sur passed on his ring to hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries if the green lantern happens to be a skilled physician then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool but it cannot do much for a lantern who lacks medical expertise when hal jordan breaks his arm the best he can do is conjure up a cast this is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one s injured body with constructs but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one s body and concentration enough to prolong the construct alan scott s ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly the rings of hal jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the central battery on oa more recent stories have removed this weakness the effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer s willpower a green lantern with strong willpower will beat a weaker willed lantern in a duel anything which weakens the green lantern s mind such as a telepathic attack may render his ring useless green lantern oath edit green lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring originally the oath was and i shall shed my light over dark evil for the dark things cannot stand the light the light of the green lantern alan scott this oath is also used by lanterns tomar re of sector 2814 and chief administrator salaak 26 in the mid 1940s this was revised into the form that became famous during the hal jordan era in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evil s might beware my power green lantern s light hal jordan many current lanterns the oath in this form is credited to alfred bester 27 who wrote many green lantern stories in the 1940s this version of the oath was first spoken by alan scott in green lantern 9 from the fall of 1943 scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the silver age many green lanterns have a unique personal oath but some oaths are shared by several lanterns they are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of aaaa or aabb the pre crisis version of hal jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals in the first adventure he used his ring as radar to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash in the second he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence finally jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used medphyll the green lantern of the planet
