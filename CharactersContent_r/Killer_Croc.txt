to defend the allytown eventually they have success and begin to repair the damage characterization edit powers and abilities edit killer croc s backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling epidermolytic hyperkeratosis a disfiguring skin disorder however it is actually a form of regressive atavism meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race such as reptiles this condition has been augmented by the presence of a metagene consequently he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance speed and strength making him able to lift up to two tons his skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of abrasion including high caliber weapons fired from a distance he also possesses an extraordinary amount of super strength for example he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort he has demonstrated regenerative powers allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth he possesses superhuman reflexes and speed especially while he is moving underwater he can also see through his crocodile eyelids killer croc also has an enhanced sense of smell once he has become familiar with a person s scent he can track them from miles away as his appearance and personality has grown more and more bestial his misanthropy has increased dramatically he is jealous and hateful of normal people and often lashes out violently without provocation as a result of these feelings of jealousy croc will often entertain himself by grabbing hold of small pointy objects as a source of comfort croc s main weakness is consistently portrayed in most adaptations aside from the batman series as being his low intellect he typically resorts to brute force to solve most problems allowing batman to outmaneuver him in combat by thinking his way through the problems he faces in defeating the powerful croc batman regularly describes his foe as an animal rather than a man he acts almost solely on instinct and hardly ever takes the time to plan or rationalize his actions this is a departure from his initial portrayal where he was shown to be a ruthless and intelligent criminal who was able to plot his ascent from henchman to the squid to perhaps the most powerful force in gotham organized crime before being defeated by the batman appearance edit in recent years killer croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations an action figure made by kenner in 1998 featured a tail and dinosaur like feet when mattel got the license to make dc products in the early 2000s they released their own version of killer croc sculpted by four horsemen studios this version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet in late 2005 a re release of this figure was modified so that the tail along with his shirt was removed this version also sports a more human head the 2002 2003 batman storyline hush featured a more bestial croc who had been mutated against his will to appear more reptilian this version of the character was drawn by artist jim lee in the new 52 he is shown to have a crocodile like head though how this came to be has not yet been revealed such a design had previously appeared in red hood and the outlaws drawn by kenneth rocafort alternative versions edit a number of alternate universes in dc comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on killer croc in which the character s origins behavior and morality differ from the mainstream setting in the non canon graphic novel joker written by brian azzarello and artist lee bermejo croc is portrayed as a large muscular black man with sharp teeth and a scaly skin condition of all his previous designs this is the most human without a snout tail or claws the book hints that croc enjoys feeding on human flesh with the story s narrator jonny frost remarking that croc has a certain eccentric way with evidence croc is shown leading a gang of thugs and later becomes a high level member of joker s newly formed gang this vision of the character is not unlike the one from azzarello s previous work on batman broken city 19 in the batman beyond comic killer croc is mentioned as being a prisoner in a cadmus labs facility his cell is briefly attacked by the new hush a clone of dick grayson when hush escapes the facility before he decides to simply leave another cadmus official later contemplates releasing croc to lure hush out but amanda waller dismisses the idea due to the potential for collateral damage 20 in the crossover batman aliens 2 killer croc is part of an experiment by the twisted black ops officer doctor fortune to create hybrid soldiers using dna from the xenomorphs and the dna of some of batman s villains hoping to harness the villains genetic traits for survival without their psychological trauma however her use of croc proves to be her undoing as batman notes that croc turned to villainy because he was naturally ruthless rather than being subject to any sort of trauma resulting in the croc xenomorph hybrid tearing fortune s head off before batman manages to drown it after destroying her offshore

recover by sacrificing his life and blood to give batman the strength to stop gotham s last criminals with alfred s sacrifice batman impales croc with a stalactite commenting that croc can keep his
