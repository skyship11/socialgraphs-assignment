external links publication history edit this section needs expansion with more info on the milestone pre dc years you can help by adding to it january 2010 an original character from milestone comics he was created by dwayne mcduffie and m d bright and first appeared in icon 1 may 1993 although published and distributed by dc comics the milestone titles took place in a different continuity in addition to guest appearances in other titles the character appeared monthly in his own series until the milestone imprint was discontinued in 1997 in 1994 the character was involved in worlds collide a month long crossover between milestone and dc comics superman titles in the late 2000s the milestone universe and characters were revived and merged into the dc universe as part of an agreement between dc comics and milestone media the merger treated the characters as new to the universe ignoring the previous crossover icon along with shadow cabinet appeared in justice league of america vol 2 27 written by dwayne mcduffie character biography edit in 1839 an alien starliner malfunctioned and exploded jettisoning a life pod in the middle of a cotton field in the american south 1 2 the pod automatically altered the appearance of its passenger named arnus to mimic the first sentient life form who discovered him that life form was an enslaved black woman named miriam who saw the pod crash land and adopted arnus as her son 1 in the present arnus is still alive he did not age visibly beyond adulthood to disguise this fact he periodically assumes the identity of his own son 2 by the late 20th century he is posing as augustus freeman iv the great grandson of his original human identity still marooned arnus freeman waits for earth s technology to catch up to his lifepod s 2 secretly possessing superpowers that belie his human appearance he has always performed quiet acts of charity 2 3 however when freeman s house is broken into he uses his powers for the first time in decades an action witnessed by one of the intruders raquel ervin 4 an idealistic teenage girl who was born in paris island the poorest most gang ridden neighborhood in dakota city her prospects seemed fairly bleak until this encounter with freeman after seeing freeman use his powers raquel persuades him to become a superhero named icon with herself as his sidekick rocket 5 personality edit icon is portrayed as a very intelligent somewhat stiff kind of person due to his upper class job as a corporate lawyer he is often criticized as being a sell out due to his conservative views icon usually prefers to do everything by the book instead of acting on instinct 4 during the majority of his series he mostly fought plain street criminals and those who gained powers from dakota s big bang dc universe edit following the death of darkseid as chronicled in final crisis the space time continuum was torn asunder threatening the existence of both the dakotaverse and the mainstream dc universe the being known as dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from rift upon that being s defeat in worlds collide to merge the two universes creating an entirely new continuity only dharma icon and superman are aware that dakota and its inhabitants ever existed in a parallel universe 6 in the revised continuity icon and the other milestone characters have apparently always existed in the dc universe augustus appears to have an existing friendship with superman and to be a member of the shadow cabinet icon also claims that due to his status as a citizen of the cooperative an alien civilization in the hoag s object galaxy he is exempt from prosecution at the hands of the green lantern corps 7 icon later plays a crucial role in the jla s battle with the star eating villain starbreaker after the events of new krypton led to kryptonians being banned from earth it is shown that the general sam lane is keeping tabs on icon it is unclear whether lane believes icon is a kryptonian or if he is merely watching him due to his friendship with superman 8 supporting characters edit raquel ervin rocket raquel saw augustus freeman iv use his powers when his home was being robbed and convinced him to become a super hero as well as take her on as sidekick all of rocket s superhuman powers derive from her inertia belt based on tech from icon s ship darnice rocket ii raquel s best friend darnice took on the role of rocket while racquel was on maternity leave one insisted upon by both icon and her close friends amistad augustus ervin raquel s infant son named for the spanish slave ship and for her partner icon buck wild mercenary man artist m d bright rufus t wild buck wild mercenary man first appeared in icon 13 it s always christmas may 1994 buck wild possessed belief defyin strength and tungsten hard skin but spoke as if he came from a blaxploitation film he was a hero to the local folks but he also took money for his work it was revealed in his first appearance that when he received his powers in 1972 his brain had been frozen which explains his outdated speaking patterns wild was clearly a parody of marvel s luke cage complete with afro gold headband and yellow shirt unbuttoned to the navel in his next appearance he is recruited to take icon s place costume included when icon returned to his home planet rocket darnice used her inertia belt to carry him making him appear to fly buck s time as icon ii was short lived as he gave his life in order to stop oblivion a mass murdering alien foe of icon in an issue devoted to his funeral it is revealed in a series of eulogies from his enemies although it is unclear how trustworthy these eulogies are that he had taken several other costumed identities all of them parodies of other famous black superheroes according to these eulogies buck once used an experimental growth serum which turned him into the gigantic buck goliath a parody of black goliath while working with a captain america type known as patriot he called himself jim crow and wore a winged costume allowing him to fly as with falcon as buck lightning black lightning buck wore a wrist apparatus that generated lightning bolts at the funeral kingfish a take on kingpin used the legendary ruby begonia gemstone to bring him back to life now able to generate green smoke the sound of drums tolling doom and a ghost like double which could possess others and make them do his bidding brother voodoo darnice however tells him that his time on earth is over at which buck removes the begonia stone and allows himself to die icon recounts that buck serves as an example to all of us of how we can be heroes wherever we are powers and abilities edit powers edit icon s lifepod altered his dna so he would resemble a normal human being thus enabling him to blend among earth s natives a side effect of this process was the maximization of his now human alien genetic structure thus icon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities that are unusual even for a terminan 3 superhuman strength icon possesses superhuman strength that is on par with superman s superspeed and reflexes icon possesses the ability to think move and react at superhuman speeds 1 superhuman stamina icon has limitless stamina in all physical activities flight icon flies by manipulation of gravitons manipulation of magnetic fields and utilizing his superhuman speed icon can fly far beyond supersonic speeds 1 superhuman senses icon possesses superhuman sight smell taste touch and hearing 9 enhanced mental perception icon possesses the ability to comprehend things on levels far above human capability invulnerability icon seems to be invulnerable extremely durable able to withstand bullets 10 temperature and pressure extremes 11 and powerful energy blasts without injury 12 he can even survive in the vacuum of space 7 icon s invulnerability has not been portrayed consistently if he is not expecting an attack he can be easily injured for example in icon 2 he sustains a bloody nose from getting hit in the face with the butt of a rifle that surprised him after being injured by payback 9 icon began wearing alien body armor to grant him further protection 13 healing factor despite his almost invulnerability it is possible to injure icon if hurt his body is capable of quickly repairing damaged tissue 9 energy generation icon has the ability to generate and control a radiant energy based on positrons 14 he can manipulate this energy for various effects concussive force bolts icon can release positron energy from his hands as bolts of concussive force 14 stun bolts icon can project low energy bolts that render human beings unconscious by disrupting the electrical impulses in their nervous systems 15 icon can also use these bolts like an electromagnetic pulse to overload electronic devices 16 energy enhanced punches icon can focus positron energy into his fists which he can then use to shatter virtually any substance 16 energy pulse icon can release all of his body s positron energy as a massive omnidirectional pulse of devastating power 17 positron field icon can detect the presence of bang babies within his vicinity by flooding an area with a field of positrons 18 the field interacts with the invisible quantum well surrounding a bang baby who then glows as he or she gives off mild gamma particles hence icon can use these fields to distinguish bang babies from other metahumans as well as normal humans according to icon he possesses powers that all humans will possess once they evolve past their limitations 3 icon possesses extraordinary longevity enabling him to age at a much slower rate than human beings 1 though centuries old he appears to be around forty years old icon s lifespan is typical for a terminan and the only power that is not the result of his genetic maximization 19 skills edit icon is among the cooperative s most celebrated mediators he has extensive knowledge of the cooperative legal system as well as decades of experience in his chosen field icon is an equally adept corporate lawyer due to his mediator background and a century s worth of experience in american law 2 3 icon is also a formidable combatant whose fighting skills are close to those of superman 3 20 icon is well trained in unarmed and armed combat having fought in major conflicts ranging from the civil war to world war ii 2 3 some opponents underestimate icon s abilities since he tries to peacefully settle disputes before pummeling his foes icon is fluent in english and galactic standard the native language of the cooperative 14 16 equipment edit costume edit icon wears a costume composed of alien materials that grant him further protection from projectile weaponry energy beams and intense heat or cold 13 on his command the info tool aboard his starship can instantly construct his costume over his civilian clothing 21 when no longer needed the costume is disassembled converted back to energy and stored in the structural files of the info tool transportation edit for interstellar journeys icon employs his personal starship that is a gift from the cooperative 17 like all cooperative vessels icon s starship has a faster than light drive that allows it to shift into the realm called hyperspace within hyperspace the speed of light is not a limiting factor and thus cannot prevent the starship from quickly traversing intergalactic distances gravity compensators provide artificial gravity that can be adjusted to the comfort level of the ship s passengers 17 icon s starship contains a range of highly advanced cooperative technology two notable items are the information tool and the maker 22 icon s starship is equipped with a local access system that links directly with the information tool or info tool the info tool is a computerized database of virtually everything anyone within the cooperative knows it even contains very detailed files on the cultures languages history and technology of sol iii earth thanks to icon s firsthand accounts of his life on the planet the info tool acquires new information from written documents verbal accounts and visual data inputs the database can even scan an item organic or inorganic and store its molecular structure within files called software apart from storing and retrieving data the local access to the info tool can also link to and control any computer operated device or system this includes cooperative technology like the starship s maker to terrestrial technology like phone lines or lights 23 because of all the data it has accumulated over the millennia the info tool is truly self aware and even has a personality of sorts the info tool relies on verbal inputs to receive commands to perform certain functions 22 in terms of information retrieval the tool can respond either verbally or by displaying its findings via holographic imagers aboard the starship the info tool remains in contact with icon via a communicator hidden in his costume 21 the communicator s maximum range is unknown the maker is a molecular factory that can construct any physical item molecule by molecule from structural data files stored within the info tool these data files are called software while the objects created by the maker are known as hardware 22 the maker operates by tapping the vast energies of the reactor for icon s starship and converting them into matter used for the construction of hardware the maker can create any item terrestrial or extraterrestrial in a matter of seconds as long as its structure is on file within the info tool these include medicines machinery e g vehicles clothing and even food 22 the maker can repair or modify constructed hardware by altering its molecular structure according to the whims of its user the maker can also rearrange the molecular structure of items it did not create in order to change their appearance or function 23 to do so the info tool must first scan the structure of the object to be modified for example icon employed the maker to build the starship garage beneath his mansion s swimming pool icon s starship has numerous projectors through which the maker can construct hardware within the vessel 22 to build an item outside the vessel the maker relies on a special probe mounted on the underside of the starship 23 it is the probe that facilitates the maker repairing or remodeling icon s possessions over great distances icon has often employed this feature to repair any damage to his costume 24 icon s starship is also equipped with cloaking technology that can render the vessel invisible to both the human eye and all forms of earthly electronic surveillance 23 though not typical for a civilian vessel the cloak was installed in icon s ship so he could use it on earth without attracting attention when not in use icon stores his starship in his garage a hangar located beneath his mansion s swimming pool 23 the pool slides out of the way to provide easy entry or exit for the ship collected editions edit trade paperbacks edit title isbn release date collected

economic and social issues which often put him in conflict with more liberal milestone comics superheroes including his sidekick clarence thomas was an avowed fan of icon to the extent that he quoted the character on multiple occasions upon learning of this author dwayne mcduffie who in the blog post he wrote on the matter describes himself as very liberal suffered writer s block out of fears that
