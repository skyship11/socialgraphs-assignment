in jsa annual 1 october 2000 17 which had no connection with the original and was a completely different character soseh mykros was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of the council not to be confused with the above mentioned council a terrorist group that had once used the hero paul kirk manhunter she originally operated as an ally of the justice society and assisted the team during a few adventures she soon departed for other causes to her interest eventually she found herself teaming up with black adam s group of loose cannon heroes a group that while altruistic had no compunctions about killing or blurring the lines of legitimacy with their respective goals she soon became romantically involved with her teammate alexander montez a man who had managed to bind the demon eclipso to himself and for a time they were happy with one another of course as with many such tragic romances this was not meant to last for long at some point in the series alex finally lost control of his body allowing eclipso to kill soseh when her guard was down alex regained control but it was too late he committed suicide in remorse dc rebirth pennyworth clone edit during alfred pennyworth s time in the military he was mentored by a man named briar who enrolled him in a program to become the nemesis a batman like figure frustrated with many failed pupils and pennyworth s unwillingness to kill briar would create a perfect young clone as the new nemesis having reduced aging he would survive to encounter batman and alfred in miami eventually nemesis killed his master and was allowed by alfred and batman to retreat into the wilderness 18 relationship of tresser and mykros edit in dc comics continuity mykros does not seem to have any connection to tresser except for the fact that they both battled organizations named the council and as a result tresser was killed in order for mykros to debut in jsa when asked in an interview what happened to nemesis tom tresser why he was killed in catwoman 62 9 and was it true that his death was editorially mandated catwoman writer devin grayson explained i was actually hoping to use nemesis for the role in which i ended up using trickster cheerful foil and potential romance but yes i was told that he was scheduled to be eighty sixed an editor liked his name but didn t like the character and had plans i guess for a new nemesis he wasn t slated to die in catwoman but i figured that if he was on his way out his death might as well be handled by someone who liked and respected him i tried really hard to show what a great character he was before i killed him in such a way as to ensure that should anyone change their mind they could bring him back without too much trouble 19 in other media edit nemesis from the
