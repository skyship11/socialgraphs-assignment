recruited into this new team though this version of the team lasts only a year later batman is revealed to be alive reign in hell edit during the reign in hell miniseries the creeper was presented as a demon that co inhabited the body of jack ryder rather than an identity he assumed due to scientific experimentation the story shows the creeper demon separating from jack ryder having been recalled to hell by lilith the mother of all earthborn atrocities it is later revealed that the creeper demon is just one of a similar looking species of demon the reign in hell miniseries had many internal continuity errors and unexplained contradictions that made its place in mainstream dc comics canon questionable at best and the idea that the creeper was a demonic entity was not repeated afterward

previous incarnations this creeper is a villain though why he would be considered for membership in justice league international earlier is never explained this oni is revealed to be locked inside soultaker the mystical sword of the hero katana along with many other souls of enemies the blade has defeated over the centuries when the villain killer croc breaks the sword all the souls are released including the creeper who reveals that he sometimes whispered to katana through the sword pretending to be her dead husband seeking out a new body to ride the creeper discovers the recently deceased jack ryder and decides to possess it 13 the relationship between this oni creeper and jack ryder is further explored in justice league dark 23 1 subtitled creeper 1 part of the forever evil crossover 9 the story reveals the creeper s past in feudal japan and describes him as a wild being who justifies cruel temper tantrums under the guise of spreading chaos although in his appearance in the series katana indicated the creeper was defeated by katana herself and that he has possessed jack ryder s body before the origin revealed in justice league dark contradicts this by revealing the oni demon has been trapped inside of soultaker since the days of feudal japan passing the time by tormenting the other imprisoned souls and that he never and could never have met jack ryder before meeting him after being freed possessing ryder s body results in jack ryder being resurrected unaware that he now shares his body with an oni demon who occasionally takes over his form and uses him to cause chaos and death ryder is confused by his occasional blackouts but continues working as a tv reporter for the show life after death dc rebirth edit the 2017 initiative dc rebirth altered dc

activate a chemical dr yatz had injected in ryder granting the creeper superhuman strength healing and stamina as soon as ryder deactivated the creeper costume and forced it to disappear his superhuman powers would become dormant as well later comics indicated the creeper also had superhuman agility and reflexes allowing him to be an effective fighter and acrobat his strength balance and agility enabled him to scale buildings with great skill and speed post crisis on infinite earths edit this version of the creeper has the same powers and abilities as before but owes them all to one device implanted in him rather than to a chemical agent and two devices when he first becomes the creeper he is under the influence of drugs as a result each time he becomes the creeper again the device not only restores his powers and replaces his clothing with his costume wig and make up but also alters his brain chemistry to mimic how it had been when he had been under the influence of drugs when the creeper transforms back into ryder ryder has trouble remembering the creeper s actions after seemingly being killed by being dismembered the creeper later turns up alive and it is now said that his healing ability is so great he is possibly immortal after this revelation the creeper is able to stun and inflict pain with his laughter and ryder now recalls some of the creeper s memories though he now regards him as a distinct personality post infinite crisis edit in this version of history jack ryder is injected with nano cell technology called smart skin an experimental science intended to create aggressive superhuman soldiers the smart skin is created with a combination of stem cell research nanotechnology and the joker s madness inducing and pigmentation altering joker venom chemicals as a result jack ryder physically transforms into a yellow skinned green haired superhuman with a mane of red fur and its own distinct personality the nano cells that transform ryder into the creeper also rearrange the molecules of his clothing to become the creeper s costume and vice versa the creeper has superhuman strength agility stamina healing and reflexes and his laugh can be focused to inflict pain on targets the creeper and jack ryder are able to share information and mentally communicate with each other other versions edit beware the creeper edit the 2003
