to create a lex luthor for diana 3 she deeply resents wonder woman whom she believes does not deserve society s high esteem as a paragon of feminism underpinning this acrimony is a deep seated envy of her enemy s power and stature cale wishes in vain that she too could be a wonder woman 4 after the dc comics 2016 continuity reboot known as rebirth veronica cale has featured prominently in the reformulated origins of several of wonder woman s foes including the silver swan and doctor cyber her plots against wonder woman have also brought her into league and conflict with several other

in medical sciences three years later she made the foundation of her fortune having worked hard to get to this position she resents wonder woman for finding acceptance in man s world so easily much like lex luthor s resentment of superman s status in metropolis and finds her message of peace simplistic reasoning that it is easy to preach an end to conflict if you are a superstrong demi goddess when diana writes reflections a study of amazon philosophy cale uses selected quotations from the book to spin the media against her 6 when the book s most outspoken critic loses a debate she arranges to have him killed at a demonstration making it look like the book s proponents are responsible she also uses doctor psycho to inflame both crowds 7 cale is subsequently bound gagged and locked in a closet by psycho who impersonates her for a brief period 7 before she is rescued by wonder woman this does not change her opinion of the superheroine but does have an influence on dr anderson which cale finds worrying 8 9 she is later coerced by circe and the gorgon medusa into aiding in their vendetta against wonder woman and applying for legal guardianship of circe s daughter lyta as a way of removing lyta from the amazon island of themyscira the process is stopped midway through once ares kidnaps lyta from the island leaving circe to abandon her scheme with cale 10 11 this story plot was to have a larger part in the wonder woman comic but was dropped due to the infinite crisis storyline cale s reaction to the media furor surrounding wonder woman s killing of maxwell lord and its consequences have not been recorded cale also played a role in the creation of the third silver swan vanessa kapatelis by buying her from sebastian ballesteros the then current cheetah and turning her into a cyborg to fight wonder woman although anderson was then hired to cure kapatelis by extracting the cybernetic components 52 edit cale resurfaces in week 26 of 52 as one of the abducted scientists on oolong island and the only female among the group 12 and suffers a breakdown after unleashing the four horsemen upon the black marvel family when black adam starts his worldwide crusade for vengeance her conflicting feelings cause her to seduce the mentally unstable will magnus when black adam actually arrives on the shores of oolong island she attempts to take the blame for it walking out to confront the maddened adam she is subsequently entirely ignored 13 according to author notes in the fourth volume of the collected 52 editions cale was supposed to originally die at this point casually slain by black adam further discussion changed her fate subsequently cale leads the remaining mad scientists to form an independent collective their first problem is the return of the four horsemen of apokolips cale ingests a semi organic containment unit and uses it to absorb the horsemen s essences she is later seen undergoing an operation to remove the unit 14 15 she is later seen in the pages of doom patrol being assisted by i q 16 dc rebirth edit veronica cale is reintroduced in the dc rebirth universe as leader of the mysterious organization called godwatch in this timeline cale remains the radically successful corporation head who built her multi million dollar business with her best friend adrianna anderson 17 this time around she was more than willing to ignore the exploits of one she disregarded as that bubble busted supermodel whose edicts of peace through love cale wrote off as a lie thinking affection only made things worse instead of the other way around 18 later on she finds the soul of her daughter isadore had been stolen by deimos and phobos twin sons of ares the gods promise to restore her to normalcy only if cale obtains knowledge of themyscira s location as part of the rebirth reboot wonder woman realizes she does not know the location of themyscira it was taken from her precisely to prevent minions of ares from learning it to either free their master or kill him and take his station cale spends several years attempting to manipulate wonder woman into remembering where to find it in her first attempt adrianna anderson her best and closest associate is killed and cale creates an artificial intelligence based on her brain patterns which renames itself dr cyber 19 cale is also indirectly responsible for barbara ann minerva s cursed betrothal to the misogynistic plant deity urzkartaga she provided the archaeologist with funding and encouragement for her expedition at the behest of her own cruel patrons while cyber engineered localized catastrophes to prevent wonder woman from learning when her friend was in danger needing the power of another deity s avatar to breach the barrier cordoning paradise from the rest of the world thus giving birth to the cheetah 19 realizing that ares s sons would not keep their end of the bargain cale struck a pact with the ancient witch circe to bind the two and make them subservient to her first tricking wonder woman into a false flag operation so the enchantress could siphon enough power to cast said terror gods into the forms of two doberman pinschers unfortunately for cale ares himself had taken her daughter s soul from them and cale would still need to find him and free him to get her back 20 it was at this point cale created the group godwatch consisting of herself dr cyber cheetah and a pmc private military company lead by poison after wonder woman frees dr minerva from the cheetah s curse cale has sasha bordeaux replaced with a bionic clone to procure the sealed form of cheetah s lord and then forces her to become the cheetah once more to save the lives of steve trevor etta candy and ferdinand the kythotaur as ferdinand hails from kythira not minos 21 22 ultimately cale and wonder woman locate ares s prison and deimos and phobos are defeated but isadore could not return to the normal world with her soul intact due to ares having freed her from his sons the only way for her to remain whole was to go to themyscira which is mystically linked with ares s prison 23 heartbroken and bitter cale returns home knowing she will never see her daughter again and finds she is under fbi investigation for godwatch s activities a vengeful cheetah then attacks cale but wonder woman intervenes 24 dr cyber ensures the investigation yields no results and wonder woman confronts cale asking her to help remove the cheetah s curse but cale refuses 25 still nursing a grudge against the champion of the gods cale would secretly fund a menagerie of new supervillainesses coming out of the woodwork while remaining clean of their larceny as her nemesis came to her in search of answers veronica simply replied that she enjoyed the joust in spite of this wonder woman knew full well that these attacks across washington were all a covert means of shoring lucrative defense contracts while also pursuing a personal vendetta against the amazon the latter connecting the ties said rogues have to the company mogul based on many of their facilities were supported by re purposed stolen xeno technology provided by the amoral corporate executive 26 later on as malefic gods from the dark multiverse would make their presence known across the planet cale would be contacted by the a i of her former friend dr cyber about the disappearance of barbara minerva the cheetah veronica was somewhat surprised by the return of her digital contemporary after she did everything to keep her out of cale anderson pharmaceuticals mainframe but was more intrigued by the prospect of having cheetah back as a research subject after she nearly killed veronica the last time they met 27 it was when the evil deities presence could be felt by the more religious or supremacy sensitive individuals in the world that cheetah would escape her confinement by cale s technical specialists while seeking to destroy her would be owner but was saved by wonder woman at the last second just before veronica could be thrown from her own office building after the cataclysm caused by the war god ares had enraptured the mythical plane while veronica found herself employing the greek deity of vengeance nemesis using her both as an employee of empire industries and a new means of discrediting wonder woman by filing lawsuit for superpowers to be registered as typical citizens working 9 to 5 citizenship 27 it was not until later that the relationship between man and god was revealed to be inverse that nemesis was using cale for her own ends 28 ends that wonder woman put to a close by embracing the vindictive scientist using empathy and not her fists she realized that her adversary was acting out of fear and despair when realizing that themyscira and the portion of the sphere of the gods which it gravitated around had vanished recently cale feared the worst as it meant that her daughter had disappeared alongside it 29 diana reaffirmed her oath that no harm would come to isadore while living amongst the amazons by actively seeking out her homeland which now that the mysticism barring her from return was no more allowed for mass transit too and from paradise again assuming it can be found as good as to her word and at risk of revealing her birthplace to her archenemy veronica was reunited with her beloved scion albeit a bit surprised at how much she had grown since last she saw her 30 the rebirth version of veronica cale is a far more competent character than her pre flashpoint counterpart manipulating wonder woman and her allies for years finding ways of triumphing over gods and better at mixing business with criminal endeavor she is also far more complex while still holding diana in contempt for much the same reasons as she did in prior continua cale was content to ignore her until deimos and phobos put cale and diana at odds she hates the olympians for the loss of her daughter and her best friend blaming the amazon for bringing her religious insanity into their lives yet by the same token was truly heartbroken at the loss of her business partner and initially felt remorse for her role in dr minerva s transformation into the cheetah her progressive characterization would grow more callous and vindictive using both her resources and intellect to further personal gain by arming potential adversaries to the demigoddess in order to secure even greater profit at her hated enemy s expense both financially and in a misotheistic sense powers and abilities edit veronica cale is the average non meta standard of a typical homo sapiens who does not engage in regular exercise while not intellectually on par with the likes of niles caulder or brainiac cale is an able bodied scientist and historian who earned more than 3 phd s in her youth while attending harvard university even before proper schooling her mother had long realized cale held a high intellect one she broadened with
