bibliography 15 external links overview edit the series took influence from tim burton s live action films batman 1989 and batman returns 1992 and the acclaimed superman theatrical cartoons produced by fleischer studios in the early 1940s 13 in designing the series bruce timm and eric radomski emulated the burton films otherworldly timelessness incorporating period features such as black and white title cards police airships and a vintage color scheme with film noir flourishes 14 the visual style of the series was based on the artwork of radomski and the gothic look of gotham city was derived from his initial designs 15 in addition radomski issued a standing order to the animation department that all backgrounds be painted using light colors on black paper as opposed to the industry standard of dark colors on white paper 14 the distinctive visual combination of noir imagery and art deco design was dubbed dark deco by the producers 16 the series initially took a variation of music written by danny elfman for the burton films as its theme later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by shirley walker an occasional collaborator of elfman the score of the series was influenced by elfman s work on the burton films as well as music of 1940s film noir 17 the series is more adult oriented than many of the previous superhero cartoons while still being considered kid friendly appropriate for younger audiences it depicts outright physical violence against antagonists including realistic firearms though only one character commissioner gordon was ever depicted as having been shot in the episode i am the night first time producers timm and radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives but the success of burton s first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode on leather wings which according to timm got a lot of people off our backs 14 during the series production producer alan burnett wrote an episode without dialogue entitled silent night to explore more of batman s sexual life but this was never produced burnett also intended to make an episode featuring a female vampire that would bite batman to suck his blood but plans never materialized 18 the series is also notable for its supporting cast numerous known actors provided voices for a variety of recognizable villains most notable was mark hamill previously famous for his role as luke skywalker in the original star wars trilogy whose prominence as a voice actor was heightened through his cheerfully deranged portrayal of the joker 19 the role was originally given to tim curry but he developed bronchitis during the initial recording sessions 20 john glover who later voiced the riddler also auditioned for the joker role hamill who found himself to be the biggest fan of the batman comics among the cast credited the laughs he had honed on stage in amadeus with landing him the role 21 the recording sessions under the supervision of voice director andrea romano were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings as is typical this method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the dc animated universe al pacino was considered to voice two face in the series but he declined the offer 22 richard moll was instead cast in the role other actors included ron perlman as clayface roddy mcdowall as the mad hatter david warner as ra s al ghul michael york as count vertigo kate mulgrew as red claw george murdock as boss biggis ed asner as roland daggett and george dzundza as the ventriloquist one of the series best known inventions is the joker s assistant harley quinn who became so popular that dc comics later added her to mainstream comic book continuity the penguin underwent change for the series his appearance was remodeled after the version seen in batman returns which was in production simultaneously with the series first season new life was also given to lesser known characters for the series such as the clock king in addition dramatic changes were made to other villains such as clayface and mr freeze the latter of whom was changed from a gimmicky mad scientist to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hid a doomed love and vindictive fury characters edit the joker s accomplice harley quinn gotham city police detective renee montoya the vigilante lock up former actor simon trent brainwashed comedian turned supervillain condiment king and ninja kyodai ken are original creations who became characters in the comics older villains that were lesser known from the comics such as count vertigo the mirror man and the clock king were modified for the series in both appearance and personality other original antagonists were created such as roland daggett red claw lloyd ventrix the sewer king boss biggis grant walker h a r d a c and emile dorian but to little acclaim and did not make any appearances outside the series though daggett was re imagined as businessman john daggett for the dark knight rises aside from creating characters that crossed over into the main line of dc comics several of the series reinterpretations were carried over as well mr freeze was revised in the comics to emulate the series tragic story the success of which actually compelled dc to bring the character back after killing him off some years earlier clayface was revised to be much more similar in appearance to his animated counterpart and two face s double sided black and white suit has become a common appearance for the character bruce wayne batman edit batman as seen in the original opening theme sequence of the series at the age of eight bruce wayne the son of billionaire philanthropists witnessed the murder of his parents thomas and martha during a mugging on the street the event left him traumatized and mentally scarred for the rest of his life this left bruce to be cared for by his family s butler alfred pennyworth over the years bruce slowly turned the pain and trauma he sustained into a burning fuel for a lifelong obsession as he underwent rigorous training in mental and physical conditioning the martial arts criminology sciences manhunting forensics detective work interrogation methods and intimidation for the next years of his life having observed the rampant crime and corruption across gotham city he chose to deal with the crime wave in gotham in his own way by using his years of training and swore an oath to dedicate his entire life to fighting crime in a bid to avenge the murder of his parents and to use his pain and suffering to drive him to do good while being guided by his self enforced moral code to never kill and to refrain from using firearms inspired by the presence of bats his childhood fear which used to be present around his home bruce chose to undertake the alias of the batman a feared near mythical and bat masked vigilante one of the most notable changes made in the animated series is the treatment of batman s alter ego bruce wayne in nearly all other media including the comics television shows and films bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous self absorbed and not too bright billionaire playboy 23 in the animated series his character is assertive outwardly intelligent and actively involved in the management of wayne enterprises without jeopardizing his secret identity for example in the episode eternal youth bruce is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a deal with a timber company in the amazon rainforest that had been made behind his back threatening him with termination upon failure to comply kevin conroy used different voices to distinguish between his portrayal of bruce wayne and batman a tactic used previously by michael keaton in tim burton s live action films 24 conroy based his dual voice performance on the 1934 film adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel 21 dick grayson robin edit dick grayson s history in the show mirrors that in the comics the episode robin s reckoning reveals that grayson and his parents were acrobats in haly s circus following the tragic deaths of grayson s parents at the hands of mobster tony zucco bruce wayne adopts dick and eventually takes him on as a protégé the series also redefined the original robin dick grayson while much of dick s past remains the same his robin costume is modernized with short sleeves and long tights exactly like tim drake s original robin outfit but with a non italicized r symbol in addition dick is given a more serious and mature personality to match the tone of the series although he does have comedic moments occasionally the episode batgirl returns establishes that dick and barbara gordon attend the same college and that they are friends but neither one knows the secret identity of the other their relationship is one of the plot elements of the film batman mr freeze subzero his changing relationship with batman into a more tenser one is also highlighted in the show with the two parter episode robin s reckoning and the episode night of the ninja examining this this would eventually come to a head as depicted in the new batman adventures episode old wounds where dick abandons the robin persona in response to batman s growing coldness and leaves gotham barbara gordon batgirl edit barbara gordon is first seen in the two parter heart of steel where she becomes convinced that her father is an impostor she makes her first appearance as her alter ego batgirl in shadow of the bat after her father commissioner gordon is arrested under charges of corruption her batgirl costume is exactly the same from the adventures of batman and the bronze age of comics sporting the same gray bodysuit blue cape and cowl and yellow bat symbol and utility belt but with blue gloves and boots to mirror that of batman s costume instead of yellow ones except in the first part of shadow of the bat where she sported a black cape cowl gloves boots and undergarment similar to the ones in batman s costume she makes several appearances throughout the series and attends the same university as dick grayson though neither of them is aware of each other s crimefighting alter ego in batgirl returns barbara actually makes a cease fire deal with catwoman and they work together in solving the case of missing valuable cat statues while batman is away all of barbara s batgirl s appearances are in episodes written by brynne stephens the joker edit batman s rogues gallery from left to right mr freeze poison ivy the penguin the joker harley quinn the mad hatter the riddler catwoman with her cat isis and two face though the joker s origin is never shown in the series one of only two villains in the series who never got an origin episode the other one being the penguin some of his past is seen in the feature film batman mask of the phantasm in flashbacks he is shown before his accident but does not speak or is referred to by name his potential real name jack napier the same name of jack nicholson s version of the character from tim burton s 1989 film is established in the episodes dreams in darkness when it is spoken by dr bartholomew and in joker s wild where it is written in a dossier the use of this origin was due to the show being heavily patterned after the success and influential tone of tim burton s film however when the new batman adventures began during the era of joel schumacher s films joker s origin was retained but his identity was retconned as being merely one of many aliases as seen in the episode beware the creeper meaning his true identity is still unknown this reflected the efforts of the writers to put the character back in line with his conflicting multiple origins from the comics in mask of the phantasm the man who would become the joker started out as a chauffeur and hitman for mobsters salvatore valestra buzz bronski and chuckie sol on two occasions he saw bruce wayne and the two exchanged glances years before they would clash as the joker and batman later it is hinted in the rest of the series presumably after the valestra mob had gone their separate ways the man struck out on his own and formed a small gang the man broke into the ace chemical plant that marked the first time he encountered batman a fight which ended with him falling off a catwalk and into a drainage vat of chemicals he was washed out into the bay and discovered the chemicals bleached his skin chalk white dyed his hair green stained his lips red leaving them in a permanent rictus smile and dyed his suit purple this new clown like appearance snapped his already sadistic mind and drove him to eternal insanity he reinvented himself as the joker batman s greatest enemy and gotham city s most dangerous costumed criminal while the use of this origin was based on the jack nicholson version mark hamill was given the note don t do nicholson before his audition 25 during production hamill asked the production team consisting of timm radomski and romano if he could play one of the villains after a small appearance as ferris boyle in heart of ice even though tim curry had already recorded a few episodes hamill was given the part after curry developed bronchitis and departed the series hamill who found himself to be the biggest fan of the batman comics among the cast credited the laughs he had honed on stage in amadeus with landing him the role 21 he worked to craft a multifaceted laugh for the joker that could change to reflect the joker s current mood likening it to a musical instrument 26 when recording his lines with the other actors hamill would stand while the other actors would remain seated to invest himself in the role hamill s take on the joker s laugh and the role in general is considered to be groundbreaking for the voice acting industry and led to hamill having an enormously successful voice acting career 26 of the many influences for his performance including jay leno and howard cosell hamill cited claude rains performance in the 1933 film the invisible man 27 28 other characters edit other antagonists that appeared in the series included classic villains such as poison ivy catwoman the riddler two face the mad hatter ra s al ghul talia al ghul man bat the penguin the scarecrow killer croc bane the ventriloquist and his dummy scarface hugo strange and tony zucco friends and allies of batman featured in the show not previously mentioned include alfred pennyworth harvey bullock the gray ghost an

the joker from detective comics 475 476 february march 1978 both by writer steve englehart with art by marshall rogers during a spotlight podcast from comic con 2007 paul dini explained that the reason why the episode combined those stories was that the show s creators could not adapt them separately because their content and thematic elements would not have been cleared by the censors the strange secret of bruce wayne was based on the comic stories the dead yet live and i am the batman from detective comics 471 472 august september 1977 by steve englehart moon of the wolf is based on the comic story of the same name by writer len wein with art by neal adams from batman no 255 april 1974 the episode terror in the sky is loosely based on man bat over vegas originally presented in detective comics no 429 by writer and artist frank robbins the setting has been shifted from las vegas to gotham harbor and in keeping with the family friendly rating of the television show the she bat is not a vampire in the adaptation the final line of the episode the nightmare s finally over is similar to one of the final lines from the original comic now fran s vampire nightmare is about over the episode almost got im appears to be influenced by a four issue story arc in batman 291 294 1977 entitled where were you on the night batman was killed all four stories were written by david vern reed and drawn by john calnan under the direction of batman editor julius schwartz in each of the four issues one of catwoman the riddler and the joker all recount their claims to have killed batman however the plot for almost got im is quite different six stories in the show and four completely different ones in the comic book with only the joker as an overlapping antagonist two face s

575 578 in the late 1980s the villain in the comics was named the reaper 32 in other media edit sixteen minutes of animated segments in the video game the adventures of batman robin for the sega cd are sometimes referred to as a lost episode of the series these segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early 1990s video game and as such the sound color and story are not quite of the same quality of the actual television program and because sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show the fights are also a little more violent many of the shows voice actors reprised their roles for the game and are thus in the lost episode as well similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games batman vengeance and batman rise of sin tzu 33 feature films edit batman mask of the phantasm 1993 based on the animated series the film started production as a direct to video release but was ultimately changed into a theatrical release 34 although the film

expectations 36 comic adaptation and novelization edit the batman adventures edit main article the batman adventures the animated series was accompanied by a tie in comic book the batman adventures

faithfulness to the source material 3 44 in 1992 entertainment weekly ranked the series as one of the top television series of the year 45 in his reference book batman the complete history les daniels described the animated series as coming as close as any artistic statement has to defining the look of batman for the 1990s 46 animation historian charles solomon gave the series a somewhat mixed assessment commenting that the dark art deco influenced backgrounds tended to eclipse the stiff animation and pedestrian storytelling and concluding that the series looked better in stills than it did on the screen 47 ign listed the animated series as the best adaptation of batman anywhere outside of comics 48 the best comic book cartoon of all time 3 and the second best animated series of all time

featured character designs strongly influenced by those of bruce timm the dramatic writing and stylized art of batman the animated series separates it from many traditional comic book based cartoons

audiences and comic book fans the lego minifigures of various batman characters are more strongly based on the designs from batman the animated series than any other form of batman media 52 more

season branding konami developed a game for the super nintendo entertainment system snes while sega released versions of the game for the sega genesis mega drive mega cd and game gear the snes genesis mega drive and game gear versions were side scrolling action games while the mega cd version featured a 3 d driving adventure all of the games had art true to the series while sega s versions featured art elements directly from the show s creators 227 the cd version has over 20 minutes of original animated footage comparable to the most well crafted episodes 228 with the principal voice actors reprising their roles there was also a game made for the game boy based on the series and created around the same time developed and published by konami this game was distinctive upon the fact that it still used the earlier batman the animated series moniker instead of the adventures of batman robin second season title given to the other games though not directly related the batman arkham video game series features some of the voice cast from the animated series returning to their roles including kevin conroy as batman and mark hamill as the joker along with arleen sorkin as harley quinn in batman arkham asylum and robert costanzo as harvey bullock in batman arkham origins while actors like loren lester lent their voice to other characters additionally the first two games were written by animated series writer paul dini many of the characters costumes from the series also appear as downloadable skins in the games in lego dc super villains a downloadable content level was released based on the batman mask of the phantasm film and contained some characters from the show including the batman the animated series version of batman the joker harley quinn two face andrea beaumont as the phantasm mad hatter man bat and captain clown cancelled spin off edit due to the success of the show fox approached bruce timm to make a spin off centered on catwoman but the project was abandoned
