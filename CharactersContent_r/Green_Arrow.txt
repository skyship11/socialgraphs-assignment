smallville main articles smallville and justice league smallville justin hartley portrayed oliver queen green arrow in smallville and is first introduced in the season six episode sneeze dc comics writer mark waid had particular praise for hartley s performance stating i think justin hartley nails green arrow perfectly i mean there s that brashness that cockiness but not to the point where you want to smack him but right up to the edge 48 geoff johns former president and cco of dc entertainment and who wrote for hartley in the episode absolute justice concurred saying i love justin as green arrow i didn t realize how good he was until i saw him on screen like i knew he was good but every line he delivered was perfect he can make any line sound good so i was pleasantly surprised by how much he stole the scenes 49 the character starts off as a recurring character who is already an established vigilante in his home of star city and is originally paired with lois lane in a romantic storyline after a rough start he becomes a trusted ally and friend of clark kent green arrow retains his many unique arrows and demonstrates expert archery skill along with skilled use of a crossbow with many trick arrows in the episode justice oliver teams up with clark to put an end to lex luthor s experimentation with supervillains by teaming up with other superheroes clark has met on his journeys forming a prototypical justice league oliver is seen again in season seven for the episode siren in which he continues his fight against luthorcorp and meets another superhero black canary whom he recruits for his justice league in a flashback sequence in the season seven episode veritas a young version of oliver queen can be seen being played by luke gair from season eight through season ten hartley is a series regular and is woven into the backstory of smallville through the queens business connections with the luthor teague and swann families oliver was a childhood friend and schoolmate and later a teenage bully of lex luthor in the season eight episode requiem oliver risks his friendship with clark by killing lex something which clark would never support over the course of the series oliver and clark become increasingly close friends and they establish themselves full time as superheroes working with other members of the justice league when required oliver later becomes romantically involved with clark s best friend lois s cousin chloe sullivan whom he ultimately marries in the series finale oliver serves as the best man at clark and lois wedding service and chloe is shown to have a son in the future who is implied to be oliver s smallville season eleven a comic book continuation of the show reveals he is oliver s son jonathan queen named after clark s adoptive father during the sixth season of smallville there was talk of spinning off justin hartley s portrayal of the character green arrow into his own series hartley however refused to entertain the idea feeling it was his duty to respect what smallville had accomplished in five seasons and not steal the spotlight because there was talk of a spin off after his two appearances according to hartley talking was as far as the spin off idea ever got 50 51 a spin off series in which oliver led the justice league made it into early development the series was to have been helmed by stephen s deknight who would later go on to be the showrunner for the first season of marvel s daredevil 52 arrowverse edit stephen amell as green arrow in the fifth season of the television series arrow main article oliver queen arrowverse see also arrowverse arrow tv series list of arrow episodes and list of arrow characters in january 2012 following smallville s conclusion the cw prepared a new series centered around the character green arrow andrew kreisberg greg berlanti and marc guggenheim were announced to be developing the series 53 a week later the series was ordered to pilot to be directed by david nutter who had previously directed the pilot for smallville 54 when developing the series producer marc guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to chart their own course their own destiny and avoid any direct connections to smallville thus rather than continuing on with hartley s incarnation of the character they opted to cast a new actor in the role and establish the series as its own separate continuity 55 at the end of the same month canadian actor stephen amell was cast in the titular role of oliver queen 56 the series titled simply arrow follows the story of former playboy billionaire turned vigilante oliver queen after he is rescued from a presumably deserted island where he was shipwrecked five years earlier it also features flashbacks to his time away 57 guggenheim described the show as more of a hero show than a superhero one wanting the show to be realistic and stated that much of the inspiration for the flashback sequences was drawn from green arrow year one 58 andrew kreisberg explained that we designed oliver as a character a little more tortured than the comic series green arrow 59 the series premiered in north america on october 10 2012 60 and was picked up for a full season later that month 61 the show went on to air for seven full seasons 62 with a shortened eighth and final season consisting of ten episodes concluding in january
