secret identity of doll man the world s mightiest mite is research chemist darrel dane who invents a formula that enables him to shrink to the height of six inches while retaining the full strength of his normal size 3 he was the first example of a shrinking superhero and also one of the few that was unable to change to a height in between his minimum and maximum sizes though artists would fail to keep his scale visually consistent his first adventure in feature comics 27 involves the rescue of his fiancée martha roberts from a blackmailer 4 he subsequently decides to fight crime and adopts a red and blue costume sewn by martha 5 years later somehow martha s wish to be able to join him in his small size comes true and now possessing the same shrinking powers she becomes his partner known as doll girl in doll man 37 6 he also has the aid of elmo the wonder dog a great dane who serves as his occasional steed and rescuer and the dollplane which was deceptively presented as a model airplane in his study when not in use 7 in his adventures published during world war ii doll man was also frequently depicted riding a bald eagle the covers of doll man s comics frequently portrayed him tied in ropes or other bindings in situations ranging from being tied crucifixion style to a running sink faucet to being hogtied to the trigger and barrel of a handgun the persistence of this male bondage motif in doll man comics among others can be contrasted with other comic books which historically portrayed women in positions of vulnerability and submission doll man was the lead feature of the anthology series feature comics through 139 october 1949 with eisner writing the early stories under the pen name william erwin maxwell and art contributed first by lou fine and later

1976 1978 in which the team temporarily leaves earth x for earth 1 where most dc titles were set doll man was an occasional guest star in all star squadron a superhero team title that was set on earth 2 the locale for dc s wwii era superheroes at a time prior to when he and the other freedom fighters are supposed to have left for earth x doll man then appeared with the rest of dc s entire cast of superheroes in crisis on infinite earths a story that was intended to eliminate the similarly confusing histories that dc had attached to its characters by retroactively merging the various parallel worlds into one this erased doll man s earth x days and merged the character s all star squadron and freedom fighter histories so that he is primarily a member of the squadron of which the freedom fighters are merely a splinter group 1 until the relaunch of the freedom fighters characters in 2006 doll man was little used by dc except for the retelling of his origin from feature comics 27 in

to distance himself from glenn hoping to spare her the pain of a miniaturized boyfriend despite this there are still strong feelings between the two and they are learning to cope with their new
