neville introduced hawkman 1 shiera first appears as hawkgirl in all star comics 5 july 1941 in a costume created by sheldon moldoff 2 based on neville s hawkman costume silver age edit main article hawkwoman with the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s the hawkman feature ended in the last issue of flash comics in 1949 in 1956 dc comics resurrected the flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory following the success of the new flash dc comics revamped hawkman in a similar fashion with the brave and the bold 34 in 1961 the silver age versions of hawkman and hawkgirl became married thanagarian police officers from the planet thanagar who come to earth in order to study police techniques silver age hawkgirl is introduced as shayera hol phonetically identical to shiera hall who appears in costume as of her first appearance although silver age hawkman joins the justice league in justice league of america 31 in 1964 silver age hawkgirl

year later edit following the events of dc s miniseries crisis on infinite earths the histories of earth one two four s and x were merged into one single earth with a consistent past present and future as a result both the golden age and the silver age versions of hawkman and hawkgirl live on the same earth shortly after crisis on infinite earths dc decided that having the justice society on the same earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team including golden age hawkman and hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the last days of the justice society one shot the justice society were trapped in another dimension limbo where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent ragnarök from occurring on the earth initially the silver age hawkman and hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after crisis on infinite earths however dc reversed this decision and rebooted hawkman continuity after the success of the hawkworld miniseries originally hawkworld was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of hawkman and hawkwoman but after the series became a success dc comics made hawkworld an ongoing series set in the present with both heroes only recently appearing on earth after the events in the invasion miniseries resulting in a complete reboot of hawkman continuity several continuity errors regarding hawkman and hawkgirl s justice league appearances then needed to be fixed including their appearance in the invasion miniseries all previous appearances by the silver age hawkgirl in the justice league were explained by the golden age hawkgirl taking the silver age hawkgirl s place however hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre hawkworld justice league adventures during the time golden age hawkgirl was trapped in limbo to explain this continuity error a new hawkwoman sharon parker was created and retconned into the justice league during the time golden age hawkgirl was in limbo after the hawkworld reboot hawkgirl hawkwoman was now shayera thal and not married to katar hol instead merely his police partner in post hawkworld continuity shayera adopts the name hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name hawkgirl the golden age hawkgirl is eventually returned from limbo but during the zero hour miniseries she is merged with katar hol and golden age hawkman into a new persona a new hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the jsa monthly title the new hawkgirl is kendra saunders granddaughter of the golden age hawkgirl s cousin speed saunders hawkgirl

of her lover khufu hawkman the pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries while not a superhuman power per se this propensity for reincarnation has

thanagarian she has considerable physical strength endurance and durability as a former member of the thanagarian military she had extensive training in tactics military science and personal combat

preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes it also has the property of radiating heat which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates 4 recently kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing strength vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing nth metal she speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance it remains to
