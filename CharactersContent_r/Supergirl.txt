david remained coy as to whether the two characters were one and the same during the dc run of the title after it moved to idw david revealed lee s origin which clearly showed that lee was not danvers however fallen angel 14 introduced lin who was said to be lee s predecessor as the guardian of bete noire 13 lin had recently escaped limbo an apparent metaphor for what happened to danvers after the cancellation of supergirl david wrote in his december 13 2006 blog entry any fans of my run on supergirl particularly those who are torqued because linda danvers was consigned to oblivion in the dcu must must must pick up fallen angel 14 and 15 when they come out next year 14 however since david could not explicitly claim that a character owned by dc was the same as the character he owned he stated can i say this is linda danvers of course i can t however it s pretty freaking obvious that it is 15 according to an interview with newsarama 16 the matrix supergirl is wiped from existence by the events depicted in the 2005 limited series infinite crisis although infinite crisis writer geoff johns later stated that danvers is not 17 the debate was finally settled in the 2008 miniseries
