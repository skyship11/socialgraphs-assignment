of their own hanna barbera animator darrell mcneil recalls the twins were created by norman maurer the super friends series developer story editor they were originally called dick and jane and their sidekick was mighty monkey before finally becoming zan jayna and gleek the names zan and jayna derived from the edgar rice burroughs characters tarzan and his romantic interest jane according to mcneil originally zan dick had plastic man powers and jayna jane could transform into anything not just animals but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other super friends even superman seem almost superfluous 2 jayna s distinctive hairdo was based on that of an animation checker at hanna barbera while the pointed ears were inspired by the character spock from the star trek franchise the twins personalities were heavily based on donny and marie osmond who were extremely popular at the time and had their own show on abc as well 3 the wonder twins were the most prominently featured characters in their first season on super friends however by the final seasons the twins were largely marginalized in favor of well established dc comics teenage superheroes like firestorm and were wholly eliminated in the final season in favor of cyborg 3 the characters were introduced to comics in issue 7 of the super friends tie in series cover dated october 1977 but published in july 1977 by e nelson bridwell and ramona fradon the super friends comic book provided considerably more details of the wonder twins background and how they came to join the team than was provided in the television series because of the different production lag times between animation and comics the first comic book appearance is chronologically before the first television appearance 3

activate physical contact is required if the two are out of reach of each other they are unable to activate their powers as they are about to transform they would each announce their intended form shape of form of zan can transform into water at any state solid liquid gas and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area in the case of becoming solid ice he can also become any form he chooses from a 5 000 foot 1 500 m humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery such as a jet engine as he did in the episode eruption in the episode pressure point he changes into a gelatinous form in terror from the phantom zone he was able to transform into liquid nitrogen in addition he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances usually very localized involving water such as a blizzard a monsoon waterspout or a typhoon as he did in the episodes the water beast the beasts are coming and stowaways jayna can transform into any animal whether real mythological indigenous to earth or indigenous to some other planet like exxor since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume she must know the common name as revealed in the mummy of nazca naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal s form she has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale as in the water beast episode in the super friends comic book their powers were shown to be more extensive by transforming into an animal of kryptonian origin for instance jayna could gain both the creature s natural abilities and the super powers that all kryptonians possess under earth like conditions she was even capable of overpowering superman in the form of a kryptonian animal 14 similarly zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice including a frost giant in the demons of exxor episode in addition to their powers of transformation the two share a telepathic link enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances as revealed in the episode the village of lost souls the wonder twins have a pet space monkey named gleek who has a useful prehensile tail and who can act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach gleek also serves as a courier when the twins need to travel jayna will typically transform into a large eagle and zan will transform into water jumping into a bucket which gleek will hold while being clutched by jayna in her eagle form a rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control on at least two occasions pied piper from space and circus of horrors while the twins were under the influence of mind control gleek caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control in other media edit television edit david gallagher as zan and allison scagliotti as jayna in the smallville episode idol in the justice league episode injustice for all statues of the twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super powered heroes later in the same scene the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains in justice league unlimited two characters called downpour and shifter appear in the episode ultimatum where they were both voiced by grey delisle they are members of the ultimen a group of superheroes created by the government and project cadmus with maxwell lord as their sponsor the group is an analogue of the heroes that were created for super friends with downpour and shifter specifically an analogue of the wonder twins downpour and his twin sister shifter have albino white skin pink eyes and pointy ears downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid like flood water and tidal wave while shifter would say the name of a creature like a sea serpent a lion a rhinoceros a cape buffalo and a tyrannosaurus in order to become that creature in the late 90s zan and jayna appeared in a promo for cartoon network where they demonstrated their powers zan expressed disappointment that he only transforms into lame things like water and ice michael bell reprised his role as zan for this promo zan appeared in season one episode of the adult swim series harvey birdman attorney at law here zan voiced by michael bell is on the stand being questioned by harvey birdman 15 in 2006 the adult swim website ran a series of five webisodes entitled the new adventures of the wonder twins these shorts were not canon but rather a dark humor parody zan and jayna were portrayed as well meaning but inept with their attempts at heroism always ending in tragic failure in the family guy episode a fish out of water peter griffin and his dog brian put their rings together and simultaneously say wonder twin powers activate after which peter states what he wants to be changed into brian tells him they got the rings as a franken berry prize in another episode fast times at

of gleek on the back and that make the sound of gleek laughing as a ringtone though not explicitly indicated to be aliens they are implied to be from another world and claim to be of swedish descent
