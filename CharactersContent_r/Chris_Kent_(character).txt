following flashpoint dc revisited the concept of zod s heroic son on earth 16 he succeeds clark kent as superman and is best friends with the new batman damian wayne on earth 2 in the comic earth 2 zod s son val zod succeeds kal el as the pacifist superman of his universe 1 a new version of lor zod was introduced in 2017 during dc rebirth in the action comics series during the revenge storyline this time as a villain 2 fictional character biography edit last son edit when a spacecraft fell towards metropolis it was diverted to a relatively safe landing by superman after its landing superman was very surprised to discover a young boy inside echoing his own arrival in his youth years before superman saw that the boy was completely unharmed the kryptonian writings on his ship stated that his kryptonian name was lor zod which was later confirmed in action comics 851 august 2007 he was taken to the east coast lab of the department of metahuman affairs under supervision of sarge steel for observation the boy exhibited superhuman strength and could only speak kryptonian he did not know his name or where he came from as with supergirl superman instinctively knew the boy was kryptonian before the tests were completed after he was confirmed as a kryptonian he was immediately taken to the department of metahuman affairs headquarters in washington d c without superman s knowledge he removed the boy from their custody and decided with lois lane to raise the boy 3 clark then contacted batman who used his resources to create the identity christopher kent 4 chris remained in the custody of lois and clark as their foster son he attended the ellsworth school an elite private school where he had some trouble concealing his powers particularly during p e to aid him superman worked with batman to develop an implant concealed within a wristwatch that used red sun radiation to block chris powers while in school until he learned how to control them while the watch was being created chris made friends with tim drake the current robin who treated him like a younger brother and offered to show him some gymnastics 5 eventually the wristwatch failed due to it being calibrated on the metabolism of an adult kryptonian and the built up energies exploded wrecking clark and lois apartment clark reassured the young boy that he wouldn t be sent away and that they would find a way to cope with his growing powers 6 afterwards superman held a press conference to inform the world that the kryptonian child was under his care at that time bizarro sent by lex luthor attempted unsuccessfully to kidnap chris later it was revealed that chris is the biological son of general zod and ursa his arrival released zod non and ursa from the phantom zone 7 he was apparently conceived and raised there within a prison structure that is immune to the timeless effects of the zone and christopher himself was specially immune as well it was insinuated by phantom zone resident mon el that zod and ursa were abusive towards their son before sending him out of the zone in a battle with superman zod and ursa reclaimed their son and captured lois after sending superman to the phantom zone general zod s army invaded earth 8 superman escaped with mon el s aid and then sought an alliance with lex luthor to defeat zod who had captured a large portion of earth s superhero population in zod s custody chris used his powers to prevent lois from being harmed 9 following the events of action comics annual 11 zod and his army were defeated and chris pursued them into the phantom zone in order to ensure that the passage between the phantom zone and the rest of the universe is closed properly since it would remain weak for as long as he remained on earth he was aware of the cost of this action and as he left he thanked superman and lois for giving him a proper family afterward mon el asked by superman to look for the child in the zone reported that he was unsuccessful so far although he knows that zod does not have him but vowed to continue searching nightwing edit after returning to the phantom zone chris entered the kryptonian prison where his parents had made shelter there he found a piece of brainiac s technology chris mind interfaced with the device expanding his consciousness and forging a connection with the mind of thara ak var security chief of kandor which had recently been freed from brainiac s ship by superman thara used the connection between their minds to stage a successful rescue attempt with the added help of non 10 when the citizens of kandor created new krypton which was placed in orbit around the sun opposite earth chris and thara tasked themselves with the mission of bringing in the phantom zone kryptonian criminals hiding on earth as sleeper agents since the belligerent government of alura zor el and zod had tarnished all kryptonians reputations on earth chris and thara decided to act as a new nightwing and flamebird duo since dick grayson the previous nightwing became the new batman at first with simple cloth masks then with fake power suits to obscure the origins of their powers however chris due to his birth in the phantom zone exhibits strange and uncontrollable growth spurts when thara saved him he was still the young boy raised by lois and clark as nightwing he is shown as roughly 15 or 16 and after another growth spurt of about seven years he ages to 23 years old 11 his mother ursa begins stalking him to exact revenge chris had been shown denying his heritage and insisting thara address him with his human name despising her attempts to transliterate it as a kryptonian name and never going by his true kryptonian name of lor zod 12 after a brutal attack by ursa thara is left gravely wounded by a frangible kryptonite knife and chris is forced to bring her to lois for medical assistance 13 upon bringing thara to lois chris and lois have a tearful reunion lois is happy to see him again but is concerned about his advanced aging lois calls doctor light for medical assistance while chris goes back to the fortress and is again confronted by ursa their conflict is cut short as uavs sent by general lane arrived at the scene forcing both to flee 14 while chris returns home to lois he finds that thara has recovered and is being quizzed by lois about their relationship before lois is able to learn anything the two fly away to confront a kryptonian couple on a crime spree the four battle with chris and thara quickly gaining the upper hand however their fight is interrupted by codename assassin and what seems to be a gang of ogres 13 the sleeper couple use the distraction to escape chris as nightwing pursues them but is forced to let them go in order to save some innocents from a falling bridge 15 after the two receive a hero s thank you from a crowd in hollywood thara notices that one of the girls gave her phone number to chris chris asks if she is jealous thara lies saying that she does not care if he goes around with hundreds of girls reacting on an impulse the two share a kiss before either of the two actually manages to respond they are attacked by metallo and reactron and captured 16 framed for murder edit fortunately chris and thara are teleported away along with supergirl kara as supergirl attacks thara for killing her father and trying to kill her however chris stops her and tells her he is her cousin the three are attacked by guardian and the science police for apparently killing mon el chris tries to tell guardian that they did not murder mon el but guardian ignores him the three manage to escape to paris chris thara and kara talk about what has happened they then discover that the two sleepers they were fighting were metallo and reactron however they are attacked by squad k 17 framed for the murder of mon el the two along with kara manage to escape from squad k and go to lana lang s apartment they enlist lois help in clearing their names chris and lana go to find lois while kara and thara stay in lana s apartment 18 chris and thara are discovered and once more forced to flee during the attempt to flee they once more encounter squad k however the three opt to surrender in order to clear their names while they manage to persuade the squad k commander reactron quickly murders his teammates and attempts to kill the three during their conflict thara is injured while attempting to protect supergirl as reactron is about to kill chris and kara thara manifests her flamebird powers and personality and easily overpowers reactron the flamebird decides to kill reactron but is swayed to show mercy after reactron reveals that mon el is alive and is talked down by supergirl the flamebird is once more submerged after sharing a kiss with chris 19 donning new costumes chris and thara continue to save lives despite their actions being twisted by the anti kryptonian media not long after chris experiences another aging spurt becoming an old man doctor light brings chris to her colleague doctor pillings who unbeknownst to any of them is the kryptonian sleeper agent jax ur 20 jax ur cures chris reverting him to his young adult form and takes a sample of his dna 21 jax ur s theft of chris dna and its purpose is soon revealed as he unleashes a replica of the kryptonian deity rao to trample and rampage across earth thara attempts to subdue jax ur and the false deity but even in her flamebird form is overpowered meanwhile chris is helpless once more stuck in the phantom zone banished there by jax ur while he is there he can only observe as thara lois and other heroes battle against rao but fail to inflict any actual damage only wonder woman managing to hold her own saddened and frustrated he is contacted by the nightwing another kryptonian entity opposite and lover of flamebird nightwing reveals that while thara is truly the host of flamebird so is he nightwing s for some reason however the two are unable to connect seeing that thara and the others won t hold out much longer chris and nightwing merge properly and are able to free themselves now a fully fledged avatar of the nightwing entity chris is able to fight jax ur revealed to be the kryptonian deity the builder as well along with flamebird on even terms furious that nightwing escaped jax ur flees into the heart of his construct rao and triggers a self destruct located in rao s heart which would engulf the earth into a black hole and rip the universe apart nightwing and flamebird together are able to overpower him and nightwing absorbs rao s heart into the phantom zone where it is rendered harmless and destroys the rao construct once the rao crises is dealt with both thara and chris regroup with the other heroes they kiss and flee in order to avoid any more hostilities with the locals 22 during the war of the supermen event the solar system s sun was turned red by the combined efforts of general lane and lex luthor thara sacrifices herself to restore it to its yellow coloration becoming a charred skeleton chris attempted to join her but the nightwing entity spirited him away 23 in the final confrontation between superman and zod chris pushes zod back into the phantom zone once back in the zone chris returns to being a young boy and encounters mon el once again 24 rebirth edit following the new 52 reboot chris kent was officially retconned from the continuity later during dc rebirth a new version of lor zod was introduced this one more loyal to his father general zod 2 freed by the superman revenge squad the house of zod ruled over jekuul a planet with two yellow suns he his father and the eradicator eventually come into conflict with green lanterns kyle rayner mogo guy gardner and hal jordan 25 powers and abilities edit chris has developed some of superman s powers his abilities are less powerful than those of the average kryptonian but the limits have not been measured he has exhibited eight kryptonian abilities so far flight he flies in the fortress of solitude and at the kent farm 7 heat vision he burns general zod s hand when he attempts to harm lois lane 9 telescopic vision he is able to combine this power with his x ray vision to watch the main screens in the batcave from afar 5 x ray vision he is able to combine this power with his super vision to watch the main screens in the batcave from afar 5 invulnerability he arrives on earth unharmed and a bus falls on him during the bizarro attack 7 despite of his ability he has stated that he isn t as invulnerable as other kryptonians 13 superhuman strength he is able to lift objects hundreds of times his own weight including a heavy old style console television in the metahuman affairs lab as a child 3 he then later exhibited a greater degree of strength when he caught the daily planet globe as it fell during the bizarro attack 7 he said that he is not as strong as other kryptonians 13 superhuman intelligence he is able to memorize a dictionary within an hour and learn the english language 7 vortex breath he is able to use this power to slow the falls of several cars allowing superman to catch them 5 as nightwing he has also demonstrated additional abilities due to his birth in the phantom zone tactile telekinesis he is able to dismantle objects similarly to conner kent 13 he also displays the skill in a more traditional sense such as moving objects without actually touching them while this is considered base telekinesis he seems to manifest this power through hand gestures instead of this ability emanating from pure thought also while he is moderately powerful in this area he lacks any fine skill generally using it as a blunt instrument of destructive power the use of his power is usually accompanied by a dark purple display of lighted bands emanating from his hands 26 kryptonite resistance he does not feel the effects of kryptonite exposure as severely as other kryptonians and can withstand its effects for much longer periods of time an ability he has used offensively and defensively in combat it is not known if prolonged exposure to kryptonite would eventually kill him or not 13 he is also immune to the effects of the phantom zone because he was born there he has a solid body within the zone and apparently ages normally while all other inhabitants are timeless and phantoms for the same reason however while living outside the zone he ages in sudden debilitating growth spurts in which several years pass to him in mere minutes 12 jax ur in his guise of dr pillings attached a device to chris arm that keep the growth spurts at bay 27 his recent merging with the nightwing entity has granted him further abilities which include teleportation he is able to merge with shadows and cross distances the exact distance he can teleport remains unknown but he was able to teleport or absorb a faulty artificial sun into the phantom zone shadow construct creation chris displays this ability in the most rudimentary form creating dark creatures shadow shields etc his exact limitations are also unknown virtual omniscience the nightwing has stated that he sees and knows everything that occurs in shadows or darkness so far he was able to detect his sibling deity who was hiding in his own shadow and sense that jay garrick was in danger of being killed other versions edit an alternate universe counterpart of chris kent from earth 16 appears in the countdown arena mini series where he is depicted as a highly evolved both physically and spiritually individual with access to vast powers beyond those of standard kryptonians sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill monarch nathaniel adam he is ultimately the first to fall in his battle against the supermen of earth 30 and earth 31 28 a previous similar version of chris kent nightwing was devised in the elseworlds series superman batman generations in issue 4 1999 beginnings and endings where a descendant of superman named clark wayne the biological son of joel kent superman s son who was manipulated into turning against his father by lex luthor and subsequently killed with bruce wayne junior adopting clark after joel s death adopts the heroic identity of knightwing 29 the new 52 version of earth 16 is visited in the multiversity the just 1 where chris kent is superman and his best friend is damian wayne batman with conner kent as superboy chris and his friends including offspring kyle rayner and connor hawke though they ve inherited the superhero mantles of their parents and predecessors are deeply bored as the world is effectively policed by superman robots and many of the justice league s villains were defeated by the previous generation of heroes they resort to a celebrity lifestyle of partying and affairs as well as occasional battle re enactments to pass the time also in dc s new 52 era a version of the character appears zod s heroic son adopted by the house of el in the comic book series earth 2 as the orphaned val zod he succeeds kal el as the second superman of his world in other media edit television edit children of zod are alluded to in seasons eight and nine of smallville in the episode bloodline it is revealed that zod s desire for a child led to the creation of doomsday amidst krypton s failing years zod and his wife faora discover the latter is infertile so they collected the dna of the most violent alien species on krypton and fused them with their own to create the perfect son before attaching the genetic samples to the infant kal el s ship when it landed on earth the dna went on to become davis bloome portrayed by sam witwer as bloome grew older and more prone to blackouts his true monstrous form remained camouflaged as it adapted to earth until it was ready to destroy the civilization he would also come into conflict with kal el now clark kent in a flashback depicted in the episode kandor major zod lost his first child in a battle with black zero in the eponymous city after saving jor el from his punishment by the science council zod asked him to clone the former s dead son but jor el refused fearing possible mutations or the clone having a shorter lifespan and zod broke off their friendship a character named lor zod appeared in krypton portrayed by emmanuel ighodaro this version was a sagitari and father of jayna zod and vidar zod lor zod appeared in the fourth season of young justice voiced by phil morris this version was born in the 31st century after the united planets released his parents from the phantom zone while lor s parents were sent back to the zone by the legion of super heroes for attempting a coup the united planets pardoned lor due to his age developing a hatred for the legion after they destroyed the phantom zone projector lor stole kryptonite and a time sphere to go back to the past and kill superboy who was the inspiration for the legion on mars he planted his kryptonite on ma alefa ak s gene bomb which apparently killed superboy unaware that phantom girl saved him and sent him into the phantom zone lor forms an alliance with darkseid to gain access to the phantom zone projector inside metron s vault lor succeeds in freeing his parents and a brainwashed superboy and brings them to earth only for the team to restore superboy s mind and end the zods attempt at conquest lor escapes in his time sphere unaware that metron pre programmed it to bring him to the moment of superboy s apparent death and abandon him before he can stop phantom girl resulting in lor being killed by his own bomb film edit a son of general zod appeared in the animated film justice league gods and monsters voiced by benjamin bratt this character is the genetically engineered child of zod and lara lor van who was rocketed to earth as a child from krypton following zod s murder of jor el upon his arrival on earth the baby is named hernan guerra and was raised by a family of honorable and hardworking mexican migrant farmers having gone through the troubles that undocumented immigrants face in the united states guerra became short tempered and withdrawn from humanity and developed a deep contempt and resentment for authority despite this he would go on to become his universe s version of superman and leader of the justice league due to his willingness to use lethal force against enemies and plans to topple world governments and reorganize world leadership under the justice league s rule he is criticized by lois lane and resented by lex luthor and president amanda waller while foiling will magnus s plot to subjugate the world using nanites and learning his father was responsible for krypton s destruction guerra
