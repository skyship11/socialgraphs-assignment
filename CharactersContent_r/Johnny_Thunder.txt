aschmeier 1 in the first few issues the title of the feature was johnny thunderbolt he continued in flash comics until issue 91 jan 1948 2 fictional character biography edit earth two version edit john l thunder is the seventh son of a seventh son born at 7 a m on saturday july 7 the seventh day of the week the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917 this causes him to be kidnapped by some brown men and sold to a group of men from the fictional country of badhnesia who had been looking for someone born at this time on this day 3 as an infant the blond haired johnny is given possession of the pink lightning haired genie like thunderbolt 4 named yz during a mystic ritual on his 7th birthday which was intended to allow the badhnesians to use johnny to rule the world however the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country 5 johnny eventually returns to the united states and lives an ordinary life until one day while washing windows he inadvertently summons the thunderbolt with the magic words cei u pronounced say you when he calls for someone to throw him a sponge which he accidentally uses to become a successful boxer 6 johnny underwent several adventures each time inadvertently summoning the thunderbolt via the use of say you in his day to day conversation never realizing the thunderbolt who moved so fast he was virtually invisible was responsible for the extraordinary events that befell him before finally learning of the thunderbolt s existence 7 in issue 11 he finally notices the thunderbolt and figures out the magic word in issue 20 8 johnny lived with his parents dated his on again off again girlfriend daisy darling who had a somewhat less than scrupulous businessman father in 1941 he adopted a little freckle faced blond orphan girl named peachy pet who despite her cutesy name and clothing was a tough little girl who was much smarter than her new father 9 10 many times during his adventures which included a stint with the united states navy peachy would instruct her befuddled but beloved papa john on how and when to use the thunderbolt s magic powers the green suit and red bow tie clad johnny s appearances with the justice society of america and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic as johnny s main personality trait was being fairly dimwitted which prompts his much smarter thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic if patient attitude toward his boss while knowing full well that he could not actually do anything until his master told him to johnny accidentally joined the justice society when wishing out loud that he could be a member and was immediately taken to their meeting by the thunderbolt despite recurring impatience with his stupidity his fellow jsaers genuinely valued johnny s good heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend furthermore the thunderbolt s vast power may have contributed to johnny s continued jsa membership his frequent blunders notwithstanding since the more competent heroes doubtlessly thought it wise to keep an eye on the pair whenever possible he finally became a member after the flash left and the group told him to capture mister x which he accidentally succeeded in doing like most of the jsa members he had his aging factor greatly slowed during an encounter with the villain ian karkull johnny s adventures ceased in the late 1940s when he was replaced in the justice society stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with the black canary 11 the reason for his leaving the justice society is eventually explained to be that his control over his thunderbolt is weakening thanks to a spell cast by renegade badhnesian priests 12 in the early 1950s johnny is kidnapped again by agents from badhnesia with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan johnny manages to summon superman and the would be conquerors plans are defeated johnny spent some time in badhnesia afterwards teaching the native citizens about democracy 13 he returns home after the country elects its first president johnny joins the justice society on various adventures crisis on infinite earths and ragnarök edit following the maxiseries crisis on infinite earths was the one shot last days of the justice society of america special 1986 this book depicted the sacrifice of johnny and his jsa teammates as they left the new post crisis world and entered into a limbo dimension caused by the actions of adolf hitler in april 1945 a wave of destruction appears over earth even as it is settling down from the crisis in order to stop a literal ragnarök the heroes enter into an eternal battle and so leave the world earth one version edit prior to the crisis on infinite earths retcon an alternate version of johnny thunder existed on earth one this version was a simple petty criminal with no thunderbolt upon meeting the earth two thunder who had traveled to earth one out of curiosity the criminal johnny thunder knocked his counterpart out and seized control of the thunderbolt he uses it to temporarily reshape earth one such that several heroes such as superman batman and green lantern retroactively cease to exist the criminal exploits the fact that the thunderbolt is keyed to simply obey johnny thunder without any distinction made between alternate versions leaving the thunderbolt obligated to obey whichever johnny is conscious despite his own morality however the thunderbolt often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage such as informing the criminal that the justice society who had come to earth 1 to find out what had happened to their friends in the justice league had disappeared when they had in fact disguised themselves as the justice league to provoke johnny into revealing what had happened to their version or making a barrier which keeps out cops but not superheroes the earth 2 johnny is apparently placed in a coma by the thunderbolt s magic though this is not actually shown the alternate version of earth one that johnny creates is sometimes referred to as earth a earth alternate which johnny thinks up himself thunder s lawless league of evil people with powers like the justice league heroes which are made up of johnny s fellow criminals who were given the powers of the justice league members are defeated by the visiting justice society of earth two who had originally disguised themselves as the jla after learning of johnny s disappearance the society s greater experience allowing them to easily defeat their criminal counterparts they subsequently face off against johnny thunder on the moon and the three creatures that the thunderbolt creates medusa man who turns people into wood absorbo man who can absorb the powers of others and repello man who throws attacks back at their origins all of the members are defeated except for doctor fate he creates a golden mask over medusa man s face and sends the wooden mr terrific and atom at absorbo man who had absorbed green lantern s power meaning he is vulnerable to wood and is destroyed he uses repello magic on repello man which is repelled and destroys him when the fight comes down to a struggle between doctor fate and the thunderbolt johnny thunder is so battered about by the combatting magic wielders whose powers fail to do any actual damage to each other that he finally gives up his attempts to use the thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place 14 the two earths and their respective heroes are restored with the justice league mentioning their world s johnny thunder as a small time criminal at their meeting the johnny thunder of earth one would return as a threat in justice league of america 219 220 johnny s return edit the absence of the jsa and of

america 1992 1993 this series showed how the heroes were adjusting to a normal life johnny is depicted as an overweight man not as old as his friends but nostalgic for the past it is explained that before he had entered into limbo he had lent his foster daughter a few thousand dollars and during his time fighting for the universe she had created peachy s frozen yogurt a very successful chain of which johnny is half owner and now very wealthy of greater import to johnny is his discovery that the bahdnesians have all but disappeared a visit to the island of bahdnesia now under the ownership of pol st germain proves that no bahdnesians are left there in issue 7 johnny states there were never very many of them and the island magic had worn out t bolt was all that was left and he was with me

though it is not clear how the personalities of johnny and the two genies interact and whether any one personality is dominant johnny s family is informed of his death and a funeral is held at valhalla a cemetery for superheroes the family does not know that he lives on as the thunderbolt the thunderbolt eventually stops displaying johnny s likeness while still speaking as him during the
