vale vicki s brother and henchman uncredited production edit robert lowery as usual on a katzman production note harmon and glut the low budget showed everywhere in money saving shortcuts and inadequacies the batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the robin costume added pink tights to cover the hairy legs of both the actor and the stuntman the batmobile is again excluded but instead of a limousine as in the first serial the duo drive around in a 1949 mercury 5 several mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial one example is that the film shows the bat signal working in broad daylight another occurs when despite the fact that the heroes utility belts had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial in order to escape from a vault batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an oxy acetylene torch from his belt to cut through a steel door the tanks for the torch are not shown to compound this mistake it is a full sized oxy acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person harmon and glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3 inch torch as used in the comics but the filmmakers improvised in following the directions for a blowtorch 5 release edit dvd cover in 1989 goodtimes entertainment released the serial on vhs splitting the entire serial into two separate budget priced tapes recorded in lp mode the goodtimes edition was slightly edited as well with several minutes of the opening chapter mysteriously cut in 1997 columbia tristar home video re released the uncut serial in
