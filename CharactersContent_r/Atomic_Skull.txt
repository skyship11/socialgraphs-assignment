brain creating painful and uncontrollable seizures when he could not find a cure he secretly contacted the criminal organization skull and they implanted him with a radium powered device designed to harness his neural disorder into deadly atomic brain blasts in exchange for him becoming their agent 3 however these mental blasts were difficult to control and only made his condition worse a situation that he blamed on superman after the man of steel captured the only skull scientists who could have cured him swearing revenge the evil genius donned his distinctive yellow and green costume with its visored cowl topped skull mask called himself the atomic skull and eventually became the organization s leader flying around in a sleek skull shaped hovercraft of his own design and assisted by his similarly costumed lover felicia who was a panther that he had artificially evolved into human form following crisis on infinite earths michaels made one appearance battling thunder and lightning in teen titans spotlight it is assumed that his background has not changed although instead of being diagnosed with a nervous disorder it was said that his powers came because he sought
