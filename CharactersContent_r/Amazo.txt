side although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest his very existence is a hazard to all of humanity 3 fictional character biography edit the android amazo was created by professor anthony ivo a scientist with expertise in multiple fields who is obsessed with immortality 4 the original justice league of america green lantern flash aquaman wonder woman and the martian manhunter discover their powers are being drained and somehow then being used by a thief who is after animals known to have long lifespans while attempting to discover the perpetrator the league is confronted and defeated by amazo who has duplicated their powers thanks to absorption cell technology created by ivo 5 amazo brings the team to ivo who reveals he has created a means of extending his life span courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures amazo captured the league then defeats ivo and the android ivo s immortality results in his body becoming monstrous in form and the android is stored in the league trophy room 6 the android is temporarily re activated twice to assist the league in regaining lost abilities 7 8 in these and subsequent stories the android s duplication of powers don t make others feel their powers being drained when red sun radiation reaches earth amazo reactivates and engages in an extensive battle with superman involving time travel only to be defeated before it can murder ivo and the league 9 later the super villain called the key having been shrunken in size re activates the android in a failed bid to restore his original height the league defeats amazo and then new team member zatanna restores the key to his former state 10 after the justice league of america disbands and reforms as a small team of mostly new heroes based in detroit ivo reactivates amazo to attack this less experienced weaker league the android defeats all the new members but is finally stopped by justice league founding members the martian manhunter and aquaman 11 a different amazo model is later activated and battles the superhero team the conglomerate 12 this updated amazo searches for ivo and encounters the hero aztek who succeeds in reasoning with the android rather than overpowering it 13 this amazo model also briefly battles the resurrection man before finally being destroyed 14 before his destruction the second model of amazo is summoned into the future by the android hero hourman who wishes to meet his ancestor this amazo copies hourman s time warping worlogog artifact becoming timazo in the process timazo wreaks havoc with his new ability to manipulate time but is defeated by hourman and returned to his place in the past so his history can run its course 15 another similar model of amazo later has several more encounters with hourman 16 another model of amazo is activated that can wield multiple powers at once and is programmed to automatically upgrade its abilities to match those of all active justice league members initially not understanding this upgrade the justice league calls in reserve members to help defeat amazo which only results in its power increasing on the atom s advice superman active team chairman at the time announces the league is officially disbanded programmed only to mimic the powers of active members this amazo is suddenly depowered and easily deactivated 17 years later batman and nightwing discover a partially built amazo android in a weapons shipment and destroy it 18 another amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of metropolis but is destroyed by black adam 19 it is eventually revealed that after perfecting amazo s absorption cells ivo combined this technology with human ova and dna to create a son of amazo who grows up as frank halloran unaware of his heritage years later frank is a philosophy student dating a young woman named sara when his powers are awakened prematurely rather than emulate his villainous father frank hopes to be a hero called kid amazo slowly becoming mentally unstable kid amazo discovers sara is ivo s daughter and was instructed to monitor frank by posing as a girlfriend kid amazo goes on a rampage batman deduces kid amazo has not only the powers of the leaguers but also their contrasting personality traits this is later used to cause greater internal instability destroying kid amazo 20 later ivo downloads amazo s programming into the body of the red tornado the android villain turned hero created by professor t o morrow another enemy of the justice league the league battles an army of red tornado androids before discovering that the villain solomon grundy intends to transfer his mind into the original android tornado s body although this plan is defeated the amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the league until member vixen destroys it 21 a new body is created to house red tornado s consciousness but the amazo programming inhabits it instead battling justice league before he s defeated by being teleported into the gravity well of the red star antares 22 the new 52 edit as part of the new 52 the new origin story of the justice league references the a maze operating system and b maze operating system designed by anthony ivo 23 the league later battles an android equipped with a corrupt version of this operating system 24 during the forever evil storyline the new 52 amazo appears as a member of the secret society of super villains 25 during the amazo virus storyline a biotech pathogen is created based on the android s absorption cells the first person to be infected by this virus is former lexcorp research scientist armen ikarus whose mind becomes corrupted in the process and replaced by the virus s will now possessing power and driven to infect others ikarus s personality is replaced by the new amazo the ikarus amazo infects others granting them super powers based on desires and personality traits but killing them within 24 hours the ikarus amazo able to enhance infected humans and control them through a hive mind connection is defeated by the justice league young reggie meyer and his family are also affected influenced by technology from the original amazo android reggie becomes kid amazo 26 dc rebirth edit in the storyline outbreak amazo is one of the villains recruited by an a i named genie created by the daughter of computer technician james palmer 27 his technology cells are later hacked and he briefly joins the justice league s side 28 amazo later appeared as a member of the cabal alongside per degaton doctor psycho queen bee and hugo strange 29 30 powers and abilities edit amazo android edit amazo is an advanced android built using professor anthony ivo s absorption cell technology this technology later indicated to involve nanites allows amazo s cells to mimic the physical structure and energy output of organic beings he encounters empowering him to mimic physical and energy based abilities such as the strength of superman the speed of the flash or the fighting skill of batman amazo s internal energy source provides power for these abilities so it does not matter what source of power is used by the superhuman he is mimicking such as wonder woman s speed being based on magical empowerment and superman s speed being a result of kryptonian cells fueled by solar radiation after his first story many amazo models retain the powers of the first five founding leaguers he met as a default power set absorbing new abilities based on other leaguers they encounter the models are usually only able to access a single target s unique attributes at a time some models have internally possessed the powers of many justice league members not just founding members in their internal database and can summon them at will but again only utilizing one person s powers at a time 31 some later amazo versions are upgraded to use and mimic multiple powers at once from any superhuman they come in contact with or anyone it identifies as a justice league member 32 several amazo models can create duplicates of weapons as well such as the power ring of green lantern the metal mace of hawkgirl or the lasso of wonder woman these copied weapons are more limited in power than the original products 33 at times amazo is a simple minded android capable of basic strategies and possessing average intelligence but with narrow focus some models of amazo have demonstrated advanced analysis and tactics in battle helping them maneuver to apply their stolen powers effectively to defeat opponents 34 in most incarnations amazo takes on a person s weaknesses simultaneously when mimicking their powers as an example becoming vulnerable to kryptonite radiation while using superman abilities multiple stories have also indicated that his android body designed to emulate the form and function of a human being also possesses the pressure points and stress spots the average human body possesses amazo ikarus edit arman ikarus is a former scientist and researcher at lexcorp who is the first to be exposed to the amazo virus outbreak 35 this version of amazo is driven to infect others with the amazo virus causing them to develop psychoactive superhuman abilities based on inherent desires and characteristics before dying within 24 hours the ikarus amazo could emulate technology and super powers he encountered by crudely modifying his genetic structure and biological structure 36 the ikarus amazo can remotely augment the physical abilities of anyone infected with the amazo virus and influence their behavior through establishing a mental hive mind connection 37 initially ikarus s body seemed to degenerate from the strain of the virus altering his biology but later his form stabilized and evolved into the appearance of the classic amazo android other versions edit captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew edit captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew 14 15 featured the parallel earth of
