calculator first appeared in detective comics 463 september 1976 and he was created by bob rozakis and mike grell 1 as is commonplace in comics the character was based on a topical event or trend in this case noah kuttler took his powers and costume design from the recently popular pocket calculator his costume had a large numerical keypad on the front and an led display on the headpiece when he typed upon the keypad he could make hard light constructs appear from the headpiece fashioning tools and weapons in the style of green lantern s power ring 2 while using this modus operandi the

adventures in detective comics stealing objects when they are their most valuable and fighting many justice league members 3 as he was defeated by hero after hero he presses a special button on his keypad that would as it was revealed to the reader in a thought balloon turn defeat into victory after months of appearances the calculator s scheme is revealed the button somehow analyzes the powers or tactics of the hero defeating him and effectively inoculates him from ever being defeated by that hero ever again this immunity manifests itself as a force field rendering a hero unable to touch or otherwise affect the calculator this of course meant he could only be defeated by a new hero the heroes had many allies to draw upon the calculator could also be defeated when his own weaponry was turned against him 4 the calculator made intermittent appearances in dc titles over the years such as blue beetle and hero hotline in the 2004 miniseries identity crisis he was revamped as a non
