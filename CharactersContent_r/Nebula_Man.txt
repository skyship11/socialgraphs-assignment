version of a sentient universe called qwewq he first appeared as the nebula man in justice league of america 100 1 described as a cosmic being whose touch has the power of 20 atomic bombs he was supposedly created by a villain known as the hand to defeat the original seven soldiers of victory a later retcon would give him his current origin with the hand s involvement being more incidental he battled the soldiers in tibet his actions scattered the soldiers through time a fate from which they were later saved by the justice league and justice society the nebula man was defeated when the sidekick of the crimson avenger wing sacrificed himself to deliver the final blow with a cosmic device wing was buried in tibet by monks who witnessed his death during the jla storyline rock of ages the flash aquaman and green lantern are sent by metron through time and space and they land on wonderworld during a brief tour of wonderworld s omnitropolis and its museum district by that world s atom analogue mote a few peculiar items are mentioned amongst them are an evil 5 dimensional imp trapped in a 6 dimensional bottle a speedster glimmer s treadmill and a larval universe they call qwewq they say that they are feeding it and hope to allow it to grow to its full potential 2 the nebula man appeared once more in stars and s t r i p e 3 before reappearing in jla classified 1 3 working with gorilla grodd and announcing the end of the world at the same time the justice league were in the infant universe of qwewq unaware that this was neh buh loh s larval form 4 in the seven soldiers series neh buh loh was revealed to be allied with or perhaps created by the sheeda time travelling predators from the end of time he served as the personal huntsman of the sheeda queen gloriana tenebrae in the past neh buh loh had been sent to slay the queen s innocent stepdaughter rhiannon a k a misty kilgore however moved by her beauty and symmetry he could not bear to do it and allowed the girl to escape this was neh buh loh s secret shame for many years it was further explained that in the 1940s neh buh loh had been summoned rather than created by the hand using a sonic horn the creature was seeking seven soldiers who were prophesied to one day defeat his mistress gloriana the hand was all too eager to point him in the right direction thus leading to the original seven soldiers becoming lost in time this same sonic horn was used by the hand s nephew boy blue to once again summon neh buh loh and the sheeda in the present leading to the destruction of an ad hoc seven soldiers team created by the original vigilante this set the stage for the harrowing of earth which the heroes of the seven soldiers series attempted to prevent neh buh loh was finally defeated by frankenstein who capitalized on a flaw placed in him as an infant by the ultramarine corps a team of heroes who had entered qwewq seeking redemption 5 allusions edit the use of neh buh loh in seven soldiers is influenced by several characters in myth and legend his failed mission to kill his queen s lovely stepdaughter 6 is a direct parallel with the fairy tale of snow white in addition his role as the horned huntsman of the sheeda has elements of characters from celtic mythology such as the horned god cernunnos and later legends such as the king of the wild hunt and herne the hunter other versions edit in all star superman 10 superman uses the infant universe of qwewq to create an earth without a superman that he dubs earth q references edit wein len w dillin dick p giella joe i the
