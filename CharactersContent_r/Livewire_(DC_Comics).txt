she gained her abilities she was also a shock jock going by the dj name leslie her show was dedicated to bashing upon superman every night claiming that superman was only saving people in the name of grandstanding and showing off she also shows a disdain for fellow broadcaster billy batson aka captain marvel her career as a shock jock was cut short when the owner of the station miguel decided to turn the station into a country station a reference to popular real world shock jock howard stern who lost his first dj job in a similar fashion miguel was also quite pleased that she was fired

the being s communication systems under superman s suggestions they threaten to broadcast the auctioneer s entire database to every alien system possible unless he agrees to release the heroes and leave the earth alone he reluctantly does so and returns everyone to earth the entire adventure was seen on every earth tv and due to the auctioneer selling the dramatic story rights on many alien
