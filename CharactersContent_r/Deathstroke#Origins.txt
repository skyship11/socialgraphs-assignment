pérez and made his first appearance in the new teen titans 2 in december 1980 christopher j priest said 1 n ot only was marv s deathstroke a villain he was also kind of an asshole which i thought was unique he wasn t some misunderstood anarchist he deliberately did skeevy things most notably sleeping with terra a presumably underage girl in his quest to exact revenge against his enemies i read that and went whoa this was beyond the joker well beyond lex luthor marv created the first modern supervillain he broke every rule by making deathstroke three dimensional and giving him internal conflicts while maintaining a level of skeeve we weren t used to seeing from a typical 2 dimensional bad guy due to his popularity deathstroke received his own series deathstroke the terminator in 1991 5 it was retitled deathstroke the hunted for issues 0 and 41 45 and then simply deathstroke for issues 46 60 the series was cancelled with issue 60 in total deathstroke ran for 65 issues 1 60 plus four annuals and a special 0 issue following his injury in dc universe last will and testament deathstroke appears in one of the four faces of evil one shots written by david hine hine has explained that the series is part of the setup for future stories all of the characters in this faces of evil series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year 6 even though the character of deathstroke the terminator predates james cameron s film the terminator by four years the slade wilson character is now simply called deathstroke even though he was initially introduced as deathstroke the terminator in his first appearance and usually referred to only as the terminator and as termy by other characters for decades the full title has not completely fallen out of use having been referenced as recently as justice league elite fictional character biography edit slade wilson as deathstroke the terminator as he was originally depicted on the cover of tales of the teen titans 44 july 1984 art by george pérez slade wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the united states army having lied about his age after serving a stint in korea he was later assigned to camp washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major in the early 1960s he met captain adeline kane who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in vietnam kane was amazed at how skilled slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare she immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able bodied combatant that she had ever encountered she offered to privately train slade in guerrilla warfare in less than a year slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel six months later adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child the war in vietnam began to escalate and slade was shipped overseas in the war his unit massacred a village an event which sickened him he was also rescued by sas member wintergreen to whom he would later return the favor chosen for a secret experiment the army imbued him with a drug that allowed him to utilize and use up to 90 of his brain s capacity granting him enhanced physical powers and near mastery control of his body accelerated healing factor and heightened senses in an attempt to create metahuman super soldiers for the u s military deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend wintergreen who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge 7 however slade kept this career secret from his family even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor a criminal named the jackal took his younger son joseph wilson hostage to force slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin slade refused claiming it was against his personal honor code he attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous unfortunately joseph s throat was slashed by one of the criminals before slade could prevent it destroying joseph s vocal cords and rendering him mute after taking joseph to the hospital adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill slade by shooting him but only managed to destroy his right eye afterwards his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision marked by his mask which has a black featureless half covering his lost right eye without his mask slade wears an eye patch to cover his eye he is described being 6 ft 5 in 1 96 m tall the teen titans edit slade has a long history as an enemy of the teen titans beginning when his other son grant received superhuman enhancements from the h i v e dubbed himself ravager and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the teen titans 8 however grant s enhancements proved fatal and slade agreed to complete the contract his first mission involved stealing the element promethium from s t a r labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon he then kidnapped the titans and placed them in the path of a promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers effectively killing two birds with one stone the titans escaped and pursued deathstroke but he severely wounded beast boy in his escape this would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two deathstroke next appeared in new york holding officials hostage in order to lure the titans into confronting him terra a new ally of the titans and beast boy were the only ones available to answer the call terra knocked beast boy out and fought deathstroke single handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a titan deathstroke escaped as the other titans arrived but by then terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership later that night it was revealed that terra and deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team 9 the judas contract edit the titans eventually entrusted terra with all of their secret identities once slade had this information he used it to systematically subdue each of the titans exploiting them at their weakest moments donna troy was gassed at her photo studio changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail victor stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment koriand r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers and raven was taken down by terra herself nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by deathstroke himself he avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken nightwing arrived at titans tower to discover slade s ex wife and son she told nightwing that terra was a traitor how each of his teammates were captured and related the origin of deathstroke nightwing in order to confront deathstroke and the h i v e joined jericho joseph wilson during the confrontation deathstroke recognized jericho as his son which caused him to hesitate jericho freed the titans by possessing his father s body after terra died during the battle slade was then taken into custody 10 slade was put on trial for his crimes but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by changeling so that he could kill slade himself believing that he was responsible for terra s betrayal of the titans slade agreed to the confrontation but showed up out of costume changeling found himself unable to kill slade so instead they talked feeling some empathy for his grief slade explained his past with terra and changeling realized that slade was not to blame for the choices that terra had made the two men parted on peaceful terms with slade returning to africa with wintergreen titans plague edit months later slade encountered the titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances donna troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter meanwhile while attending a fundraiser with his father gar logan recognizes slade trying to maintain a low profile when he finally catches up with slade he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser walter lanier he stops deathstroke but is surprised when lanier turns into a bat like creature and flies away slade reveals to the titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others but did not realize what it was until it was too late after jericho and raven were stricken by the plague he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion titans hunt edit shortly after this he came to the titans assistance again during the titans hunt storyline the members of the titans as well as many inactive members all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the judas contract mento an on and off member of the doom patrol hires deathstroke to find the missing titans he eventually discovers with nightwing that the abductions were the work of the wildebeest society and that their leader was none other than titans member jericho deathstroke s son it was revealed that jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of azarath as they were using him to capture the titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive during the transfer process jericho s true self resurfaced briefly begging his father to kill him to spare his son any more pain and save the remaining titans slade was forced to drive a sword through jericho s heart seemingly killing him afterward slade continued his life as a mercenary but also acted as an occasional ally to the titans aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry most notably during the total chaos storyline when the team titans arrived in the 20th century to assassinate donna troy before she could give birth to her son who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot lord chaos slade also met pat trayce a tough former cop who would become the new vigilante pat trayce became slade s lover later on and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship family business edit after slade foiled an assassination attempt on the president of the united states he was subsequently framed for the murder of a u s senator the man responsible had taken on the identity of the ravager and was hunting down slade s friends and loved ones eventually with the help of the titans and sarge steel slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be steve dayton under the alias of the crime lord who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his mento helmet meanwhile slade s relationship with his estranged wife adeline took a tragic turn as slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact but this power is limited as slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor after gaining this power slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality this alteration of her dna drove adeline insane shaming deathstroke into going into a semi retirement state in titans 12 deathstroke teamed up with the titans to face his wife adeline who in her insane state had revived the h i v e and sought to rid the world of all superhumans blaming them for jericho s apparent death during the battle interrupted by vandal savage and a band of villains that he had organized from recent titans battles adeline s throat was slit in a brief return of sanity she begged slade to kill her requesting him to reunite her with my our children because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound but only allow her to live in spite of it deathstroke refused but koriand r shocked her teammates and deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely per adeline s wishes this was a turning point as deathstroke renounced all ties with the titans as a result of starfire s act it was then revealed that jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into deathstroke in the instant before his death taking control of his father jericho forced deathstroke to murder his longtime butler mentor and confidant wintergreen he then launched a series of attacks against the current teen titans most notably shattering impulse s knee with a shotgun blast before leaving his father s body deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child rose wilson into the mercenary business as the new ravager in order to find and kill jericho using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge unfortunately the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him nightwing and birds of prey edit deathstroke appeared in nightwing vol 2 23 as a mercenary against black canary and conner hawke as part of the brotherhood of the fist tie in to the no man s land story arc 11 deathstroke also appeared in birds of prey 22 24

the team of elongated man flash zatanna hawkman green arrow black canary atom and green lantern he systematically took out every member except for rayner whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring s energies using his own formidable willpower but before the outcome of this conflict with green lantern ended green arrow stuck an arrow in deathstroke s right eye socket enraging him slade went ballistic which derailed his pre planned strategy and began to beat green arrow but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled deathstroke to the ground dr light used his powers to allow the two to escape near the end of identity crisis deathstroke confronts green arrow on a rooftop arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building but when he turns to confront slade deathstroke is gone instead green arrow finds slade s cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in slade s eye socket the note reads this is yours we re not done infinite crisis edit deathstroke was a founding member of lex luthor s secret society of super villains in the infinite crisis storyline he was seen in infinite crisis 1 hiding in a warehouse south of metropolis waiting to ambush the freedom fighters with several other members the battle did not last long and by the end deathstroke had killed the phantom lady slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on uncle sam by shooting him in the back and leading to his apparent death 7 he was the employer of nightwing whom he hired to train his daughter rose however after the two have a confrontation with superman deathstroke discovers that nightwing had been teaching rose the values of heroism he could not kill grayson in front of his daughter because doing so would undo all of slade s teachings nightwing offered a deal he would stay away from rose if slade would keep the metahuman villains out of blüdhaven the deal held for 34 hours until infinite crisis 4 when slade under the orders of alexander luthor jr the real leader of the society went with several villains including old titans and doom patrol foes and brotherhood of evil members monsieur mallah and brain to drop chemo another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals on blüdhaven killing over 100 000 people slade gave the explanation to the brotherhood that nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again nightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on deathstroke and rose s training session revealing to the latter that the kryptonite that deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to kryptonians as revealed by luthor s old possession of a kryptonite ring that had forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body angered slade went after nightwing with a grenade only to have rose try to stop him amid the smoke of the resulting explosion rose fled telling her father that she hated him nightwing disappeared as well but not before leaving a note for slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for blüdhaven at the climactic battle of metropolis at the conclusion of infinite crisis slade was confronted by batman robin and nightwing during the struggle he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the secret society his claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor and nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him enraged slade said that was because of nightwing and that it was always because of him before batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious one year later edit cover of teen titans vol 3 43 titans east part 1 art by tony daniel slade appears in the green arrow series after the one year jump in dc comics storylines apparently in hiding he nearly murders a crony of several star city businessmen who want to hire him for a murder before finishing his violent refusal he asks the name of the target when informed that it was to be the mayor of star city oliver queen whom

identities trapping him within a ring of armed national guardsmen 13 the fight ends with deathstroke s arrest 14 and subsequent conviction and incarceration 15 however this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to constantine drakon another jailed foe of green arrow who has information on the hero s activities in the lost year 16 which include green arrow studying under natas an assassin who once trained deathstroke himself 17 deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in teen titans currently in the process of organizing a counter team of teen superhumans that will be known as titans east the current titans team included ravager who now wanted nothing to do with her father deathstroke seemingly intended to reclaim ravager and a recently resurrected jericho from the titans or if that failed to crush them along with the rest of the team for these reasons he specially selected each member of titans east believing that overall each member would successfully counteract every member of the current teen titans line up as indicated over the course of the subsequent issues deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another he had blackmailed former titan risk while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage was drugging batgirl with the same serum he had used on rose and supplied inertia with a formula that granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the speed force following the initial battle with superboy prime his team however slowly fell apart over the course of the attack as robin managed to free batgirl of his mind control serum and raven convinced duela dent to switch sides slade and his remaining titans subsequently faced off against both the current titans and a group of old titans led by nightwing although he was defeated he still managed to escape with the aid of inertia in the end however it was revealed to the readers that slade s real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them a real family in the form of the teen titans by attacking the titans he insured that rose and jericho would become more trusted by their associates and thus grow closer to the team recently deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting through unknown means the powers of geo force the half brother of the original terra into the same powers as his traitorous sister using this leverage deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if geo force became his own personal spy within the justice league unfortunately for deathstroke geo force alerted batman superman and wonder woman of deathstroke s scheme which culminated in geo force alerting the league that deathstroke whose rivalry with green arrow had reached vendetta level proportions planned on using an army of supervillains to crash green arrow and black canary s wedding weeks later geo force was tortured by gorilla grodd after the league was kidnapped by the injustice league and ultimately transferred to

jericho cured from his earlier insanity arrives and turns the tide of the fight during the course of the battle deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the teen titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail just as slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the black lanterns and their power rings permanently sending them back to the grave after realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the black lantern corps rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive and leaves after threatening to kill slade if he tries to stop her jericho chooses to stay with his father reasoning that only slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness 20 batman and robin edit recently deathstroke has been seen working with talia al ghul controlling the body and physical actions of the current robin in order to kill the recent batman deathstroke is able to control robin s actions thanks to a neural
