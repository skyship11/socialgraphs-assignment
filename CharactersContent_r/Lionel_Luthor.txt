darkseid possesses lionel s corpse to attack clark however clark destroys lionel s body dispelling darkseid s threat 23 portrayal edit lionel luthor was created by alfred gough and miles millar specifically for smallville to provide a parallel to the kents as an experiment in extreme parenting 24 the character chloe sullivan allison mack was also created for the show lex s father has previously been depicted in other media lionel luthor is portrayed in the program by john glover glover said he appreciates the clear canvas he had to work with when developing his portrayal of lionel in season one glover traveled from new york to vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in new york at the time 25 when portraying the character s struggle with terminal liver disease glover was inspired by a friend s battle with cancer he said his friend was a cheerleader to people who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad when glover s friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later this helped glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide which lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal 26 character development edit storyline progression edit in season two lionel moves from being recurring figure to a regular character this season features the gradual unveiling of lionel s increasing involvement with the characters of the show it begins with more direct involvement when luthor hires martha kent as his assistant and then indirectly when he becomes the conservator of the kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mystery of the symbols on the cave walls 27 during season three lionel becomes the villain of the show when he tries to discover clark s secret and drives lex into a psychotic breakdown this allows lionel to use electroshock therapy on lex to erase his knowledge of lionel s co opting of morgan edge to kill lionel s parents for their life insurance 26 the creative team experimented with lionel s character in season four creating a storyline in which lionel is reformed executive producer greg beeman said the character development failed and as a result lionel returned to his normal self john glover found playing lionel as a straight arrow was boring 28 season five explores the relationship between martha and lionel both annette o toole and al gough said lionel was slightly attracted to martha but that she would never act on that feeling the producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters 29 most of lionel s motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was good 30 glover said he believes lincoln cole s ian tracey actions in mercy made lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character by the end of the fifth season lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other 30 smallville s writer and executive producer brian peterson said the creative team wanted to remind the audience that lionel was still the same lionel luthor they had come know so they delayed revealing lionel s usual antics until season six s promise in which he blackmails lana into marrying lex peterson wanted to slap the audience in the face with a reminder of lionel s former character although lionel blackmails lana into marrying lex john glover said lionel was trying to protect clark for which he needed lana s help by the time season six began airing john glover realized lex was starting to become more villainous and that his time on the show would be limited glover hoped lionel would still be able to influence his son as the show progressed he believed his character would be useless on the show without such influencing abilities glover said the conflict between lex and his father is very positive for the show because lionel s attempt to bond with lex and the distrust between them makes drama 31 characterization edit john glover characterizes lionel as a businessman who is disappointed with his son to glover lionel is this rich and powerful businessman who sees his son as a wuss and fraidy cat it was important to glover that lionel appear as human as possible glover said he does not want to simply twirl his mustache 25 glover described lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants he characterizes lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily lionel uses that ability to further his goals the character can also get past people s defenses and manipulate them glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than lionel 27 lionel s character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the sinister nature of the character 32 lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or clinical blue background lionel s signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power by growing it out and refusing to style it lionel attempts to show he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash 33 relationships edit the relationship between lionel and his son lex is strained it has been likened to the relationship between norman and harry osborn in the spider man movie 1 glover tried to make lionel appear as though he is trying to toughen lex up the character is made to go out of his way to give lex tests so lex can prove himself 25 glover sees the character as a rich and powerful businessman who is disappointed in his son glover s goal for season one was to show lionel s attempts to make lex tougher he interprets the character s motto in his raising of lex as no risk no rewards 25 what i was working on and continue to work on is to see him strengthen lex lionel doesn t seem to be a man who wants his son to be afraid so he s gone out of his way to give him tests so he can prove himself that s what locking him inside the plant in jitters was all about lionel makes the decision to close the gate it s a tough decision but he knows that if lex survives he will be a stronger person no risk no reward glover explains lionel s parenting techniques 25 glover believes lionel has two competing agendas with lex for lex to become his own man and for lex to follow in his father s steps this becomes frustrating for lex because lionel wants his son to be both loyal follower and the best person he can be this all plays into lionel s pretty huge ego 26 john glover believes if lionel and lex were not related lionel would have destroyed lex early on because he views his son as weak lionel is also bound by the fact that lex is his heir although he does not trust lex lionel s distrust of lex partially arises because he believes lex is a coward john glover said it s not that lionel is meant to be a foe it s just that the poor boy s weak so lionel must mold him lionel is continually trying to strengthen his son to teach him lex is just a hard student 28 lionel also has a key relationship with martha kent clark kent s adoptive mother this relationship first develops in season two when lionel hires martha to be his assistant 27 it is further developed in season five 29 glover felt lionel s attraction to martha grows in season five when jonathan kent dies because he now sees martha as a single woman and is now more attainable glover believes lionel was seeking to attain martha s goodness and the attraction is not based on lust when lionel is in martha s company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior writer holly harold said his relationship with martha parallels lex s relationship with lana both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side 30 annette o toole said martha s interest in lionel is like watching a dangerous animal it s that attraction you have for a very beautiful dangerous animal you know you can t stop watching it but at the same time you feel oh my god he s going to kill me o toole also said she believes martha s motivation is to get close enough to lionel to know what he is planning to do to clark when martha left the show writer todd slavkin said they wanted to give the character more of a send off than they achieved on screen slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave john schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in the writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the u s senate creating a parallel to clark where martha fights injustice on the political stage 34 o toole and al gough said martha has a small attraction to lionel and that nothing serious would come from it 29 glover believes martha influenced lionel to start believing that sacrifice is necessary to make the world a better place when she leaves at the end of season six lionel no longer has that influence he is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality according to series writer caroline dries the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act dries said this is embodied when he threatens lana into marrying lex later revealing it was to protect clark 31 glover describes his off screen relationship with annette o toole the reason martha and lionel have such good chemistry glover said that when martha and lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and o toole are sharing a conversation and that trust is visualized on the camera 30 reception edit for his portrayal of lionel luthor on smallville john glover was nominated for two saturn
