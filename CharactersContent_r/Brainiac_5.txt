eliminated supergirl from existence brainiac 5 as well as everyone else has no recollection of her beyond this however brainiac 5 s history was relatively unaffected by the crisis although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new brainiac 1 following the death of the pocket universe superboy brainiac 5 is one of a number of legionnaires who swear revenge on the time trapper to this end he recreated the infinite man the infinite man and time trapper seemingly destroy each other but brainiac 5 quits the legion after being accused of murdering professor rugarth he rejoins in legion of super heroes vol 3 63 august 1989 shortly before the five year gap five year gap edit five years after the end of the magic wars things had radically changed for the heroes most notably the disbanding of the legion and an ongoing war with the khund empire which had resulted in earth s government earthgov signing a deal with the dominators when legion of super heroes vol 4 began brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the validus plague a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former lightning lad garth ranzz soon after the start of legion vol 4 a retcon removed the superman family of characters almost completely from legion continuity supergirl was replaced by laurel gand a daxamite descendant of lar gand s brother unlike supergirl she was a native of the 30th century brainiac 5 and laurel did have a relationship but the couple eventually separated and she became the common law wife of rond vidar a legion ally and green lantern who had been a close friend of brainiac 5 brainiac 5 joined other legionnaires in searching for the space pirate roxxas and was present when the team officially reformed the reassembled legion repelled a khund invasion fleet and confronted darkseid but shortly thereafter was swept into the war against the corrupt earthgov and the dominators during the dominators subjugation of earth the members of their highly classified batch sw6 escaped captivity originally batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenage legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken just prior to ferro lad s death at the hands of the sun eater later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts after earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 8 a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as new earth the sw6 legionnaires including their version of brainiac 5 remained not long after the destruction of earth brainiac 5 discovered the timestream was extremely unstable and that legion history was in a state of constant flux this was the first indication of zero hour the event that would lead to the legion s whole history being rebooted during a battle with glorith a time warping sorceress brainiac 5 was rapidly aged into a weathered enfeebled older man due to the trauma of this rapid aging brainiac s already prickly personality took a turn for the worse and he became colder more clinical and even amoral when the legion was forced to go on the run as fugitives after being framed by universo and the khund empire brainiac wore a high tech combat suit to protect his ravaged new body and went by the simpler moniker of 5 when zero hour befell the legion brainiac 5 redoubled his efforts to save the timestream and reality as the 30th century knew it despite all the brilliance of brainiac and his youthful sw6 counterpart combined they could not save themselves from being swallowed up by temporal entropy and their timeline was rebooted zero hour reboot continuity 1994 2004 edit main article legion of super heroes 1994 team following the zero hour event and the rebooting of the legion the new brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues he barely interacted with the other legionnaires although he was still somewhat attracted to laurel gand now called andromeda who was now also something of an outsider when andromeda was believed killed he was the only person who really missed her a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion 9 it was later revealed that even amongst coluans querl dox had been something of a loner due to his even higher intelligence interest in practical experiments rather than pure thought and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments it was also revealed that his mother brainiac 4 had abandoned him at birth having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child 10 as a child he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people developing no social skills having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century leading to the legion s rescue of valor brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time travel he was later pardoned when r j brande became president of the united planets in addition to having a crush on andromeda brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo collection featuring andromeda herself dreamer nura nal spark ayla ranzz and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with in obviously invisible kid lyle norg and probably others 11 before that in a moment of rare emotional outburst brainy kisses lyle s cheek as he finds him again and right after he feels embarrassed 12 trapped in the 20th century edit brainiac 5 was one of a number of legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century he spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment he finally produced a computer capable of doing this utilizing a 30th century omnicom a new gods mother box loaned to him by metron and the responsometer of veridium of the metal men unfortunately this became the post zero hour c o m p u t o the legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time while in the 20th century he also encountered his ancestors brainiac and vril dox ii as well as the post crisis supergirl ironically he was attracted to supergirl due to her similarity to andromeda some stories suggested that brainiac 5 s attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth 10 13 upgrade brainiac 5 1 edit upon his return he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly the anomaly upgraded him he was now more considerate of others and had vastly improved people skills he also internalized his force shield apparatus following his return from the space anomaly a friendship was formed with his teammate gates who dubbed the improved querl dox brainiac 5 1 a name he adopted 14 shortly after that the legion investigated the criminal terrorist organization called the dark circle querl learned his mother brainiac 4 was the leader of the dark circle having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions 15 the shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former distant self although he did not revert he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again he also began researching without considering the consequences again inadvertently transforming the team into a bizarro legion 16 legion lost edit main article legion lost brainiac 5 1 was amongst the legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the stargate network was shut down they spent a year travelling through the lost galaxy during this time he felt a great amount of stress as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation as he eventually confessed to saturn girl he did not have a clue how to get them home or even where home was relative to their location in the same conversation he also complained that he d always hated his name upgrade and on the way out as well as reassuring him she made a point of redubbing him brainiac five and he dropped the 1 from his name thereafter 17 eventually using his teammate shikari s tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they d earlier found but been forced to leave he did get them home upon their return brainiac began developing a replacement for the stargates based on the threshold doorway they had used to return from the lost galaxy restoring the connection to the planet xanthu they learned that it had been at war with robotica the robot homeworld until they mysteriously disappeared robotica s leader was revealed as c o m p u t o a strike team was launched against it but brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself so it no longer sought vengeance 18 it was revealed that the coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence however and brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine life from destruction 19 dc one million edit main article dc one million during the reboot legion s heyday they are tangentially involved in the dc one million crossover where the audience is shown the justice legion l of the 853rd century loosely based on members of the legion of the 31st century the justice legion l are tasked with protecting the remains of the united planets by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on braal several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new symbiotic worlds including colu bgztl the justice legion l includes brainiac 417 a counterpart to brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world as with all members of his race he combines super intelligence with an ephemeral intangible state brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body his race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought brainiac 417 is not the leader of the justice legion l that duty fell to cosmicbot but is one of the most valuable members and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of superboy for the purposes of saving the day threeboot continuity 2004 2009 edit main article legion of super heroes 2004 team cover to legion of super heroes vol 5 1 2005 art by barry kitson in volume 5 of the legion of super heroes title brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor vril dox ii in l e g i o n he is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially but is more politically savvy he has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting legion leader cosmic boy who suspects him of planning a coup he also has problems with dream girl as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means brainy was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry when she was killed during terror firma s attack on the legion hq on earth he became obsessed with outthinking death in a botched experiment to restore her to life he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams and keep using her precognition in his behalf following cosmic boy s disappearance brainiac 5 has become the advisor to legion leader supergirl and later to lightning lad brainiac 5 eventually proposes to dream girl after spending the night together in which dream girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist however on the same night princess projectra has

to strip brainiac 5 of her constant counseling 20 he much later manages to turn their dream into reality when forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the cyberspace creates a new body for dream girl imprinting her personality into the cloned body successful in his attempt that despite nura s previsions even restored her lost sight brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage holding hands with his resurrected soon to be bride 21 unbeknownst to brainiac 5 the dark side of his mind the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings was granted a physical body by princess projectra and sent to the physical body 20 post infinite crisis 2007 edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics this incarnation of the legion shares roughly the same history as the original legion up to the events of crisis on infinite earths 22 the lightning saga edit main article the lightning saga the original brainiac 5 from the pre crisis universe briefly appeared in the justice league justice society lightning saga crossover he was revealed as the mastermind behind the legion s plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to the flash at the end of the storyline brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the legionnaires used on 21st century earth and told his teammates that the legion had gotten what it came for this brainiac 5 s agenda does not end there however in the pages of countdown una arrived in the present to stop karate kid from returning to the 31st century explaining that brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day superman and the legion of super heroes edit main article superman and the legion of super heroes in this follow up story to the lightning saga taking place in action comics 858 863 brainiac 5 is masquerading as a tyrannical dictator of colu but only to delay colu which is the strategical beachhead of a united planets attack on earth and keep them from completing their calculations brainiac still possesses the lightning rod and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the crisis of the 31st century however his ruse is discovered and brainiac leaves with the legion with only four hours until the united planets go to war 23 after superman and the legion defeat earthman and his justice league of earth and convince the armada to stand down brainiac 5 tells superman that the legion will not forget him this time final crisis legion of three worlds edit main article final crisis legion of three worlds in this final crisis tie in brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being

frees the legion of super villains brainiac 5 informs his fellow legionnaires of his plan to recruit their post zero hour and threeboot selves to help 24 his plan succeeds and brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities the threeboot version of brainiac refuses to work with his older self due to his rebellious nature while the post zero hour version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced and tries to mediate between his alternate selves 25 despite their differences all three versions of brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original brainiac s master contingency plan against superboy prime this plan which involved the resurrections of superboy prime foes bart allen kid flash whose essence was in the lightning rod and conner kent superboy was devised long ago when brainiac 5 was forewarned of prime s arrival by one of dream girl s prophesies the new 52 edit brainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the flashpoint miniseries as is true for the legion of super heroes as a whole however the term brainiac is no longer his name but an honorable title 26 this adds understanding to the opening arcs of action comics vol 2 2011 by grant morrison where an alien is stealing and bottling cities an act usually committed by brainiac but is here only named the collector dc rebirth edit a younger brainiac 5 appears briefly during justice league vol 3 2017 by bryan hitch though unconnected to the legion he is also not referred to by his name only as the brainy kid by cyborg after analyzing the timeless technology with specialized contacts he lends cyborg his prototype flight bracelet marked with the brainiac sigil so the league member can reach the weapon in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock brainiac 5 is among the legion of super heroes members that appear in the present after doctor manhattan undid the experiment that erased the legion of super heroes and the justice society of america 27 powers and abilities edit brainiac 5 possesses a twelfth level intellect which grants him superhuman calculation skills amazing memory and exceptional technical knowledge by comparison the 20th century earth as whole constitutes a sixth level intellect and most of his fellow coluans have an eighth level intellect the 31st century earth as whole is a ninth level intellect his incredible memory allows him to retain the knowledge of events that all others forget such as their first meeting with three different legions 28 the post zero hour version of brainiac 5 was shown in several issues to be able to ponder twelve lines of thought simultaneously 29 when a renegade titanian read his mind she discovered that his subconscious usually more active and chaotic part of the mind was less active than twelve simultaneous conscious thoughts whether any other version of brainiac also exhibits this trait remains to be seen 10 equipment edit since brainiac 5 processes a superhuman intelligent mind he built numerous devices to aid himself and his fellow legionnaires in their missions his primary role have always been that of a scientist the legion flight ring is one of his most important inventions which it had significant roles in over these various adventures 30 another invention a force field belt that proves useful to him and remained his main method for self defense in cases where he found himself battle in every version of the legion 31 in recent issues of the legion of super heroes brainiac 5 s signature invention the force field belt was now being called as an irreplaceable piece of his family history by brainiac 5 himself 32 in various storylines another invention of his is the super computer c o m p u t o this machine had been included in most versions of the legion but always reworked in a storyline to suit the situation required for brainiac 5 modified his time sphere into the time bubble and with it he can travel through time to send or bring other dc characters to or from the 31st century other methods of space travel have included these devices such as the development on threshold technology 33 and a wormhole conduit teleporter 34 not all of brainiac 5 s inventions have proved useful to the legion both versions of c o m p u t o each proved to be among his worst mistakes while not a product of his own research but rather stolen data brainiac 5 also managed to create bizarro versions of many legion members 35 in other media edit television edit brainiac 5 made a non voiced cameo appearance in superman the animated series in the episode new kids in town he chats with teammate triplicate girl at the time of his debut it was unclear if he in fact used his given name or had any connections to brainiac however his costume included a chest symbol comprising three circles forming an inverted triangle this closely resembled the discs on the animated brainiac s forehead and his icon when he was a computer program suggesting some kind of connection between them it was revealed on commentary on the superman the animated series vol 3 dvd box set that this character was in fact brainiac 5 brainiac 5 appears in

weapons or transform into a large battle robot form much like the reboot legion member gear his ai core is based on the original brainiac 1 0 from whom he tries to distance himself as best as possible unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling this version is considerably more emotional in the first season he often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates particularly the original superman brainiac 5 unlike his villainous ancestor idolizes superman however his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict for example he idolizes superman but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for superman once he is returned to his own time as superman s knowledge of his future events could change what is for the legion history in the second season episodes chained lightning and message in a bottle brainiac 5 grows close to shrinking violet however as the series ended it
