part of the justice league international team fire is injured toward the end of the first story arc and is sidelined for the remainder of the run powers and abilities edit the original green fury had magical flame breath powers due to brazilian mysticism she could control her flame breath to allow her to fly and land like a rocket she was able to mystically alter her clothing when needed and change the color of her eyes from green to black and vice versa she was also able to create and cast illusions with her dazzle power and fire blasts with her white hot flame or super cold freezing flame her green flame had the magical ability to heal and repair her costume after a battle beatriz was also trained by batman in hand to hand combat due to the events of the crisis on infinite earths green fury never had any of these magical powers and had a new revised origin in her post crisis incarnation beatriz s only power gained from saturation by an organic energy source called pyroplasm was the ability to breathe a jet of green flame from her mouth during the invasion crossover event the alien dominators set off a metagene bomb in the upper atmosphere which affected almost all dc characters with superpowers and after a period of illness fire found her powers greatly magnified as an after effect the new fire was now able to completely turn into a being of green plasma in which form she could fly and throw devastating blasts solid objects could pass completely through her form without causing injury but it took her some time to come to terms with her increased powers and she often flamed on involuntarily when stressed or angry and sometimes still does a distressingly common event for a character depicted as having a tendency towards passionate outbursts the super buddies continuity established and made light of the fact that flaming on destroyed bea s clothing rendering her naked when she stopped using her powers checkmate and other appearances have ignored this beatriz is also a skilled investigator and espionage agent and in the latter context was considered a valuable asset by checkmate chief amanda waller for her ability and willingness to kill in order to complete missions unlike many of her contemporaries who maintain a no kill policy in other media edit television edit live action edit michelle hurd as fire in justice league of america fire
