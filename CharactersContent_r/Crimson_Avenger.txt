victim the character was shown avenging in an early appearance whether the avenger is carlyle herself or not remains unclear while the avenger s curse sends her after those who have taken an innocent life an encounter with wildcat and power girl reveals that innocent only has to mean that the victim was innocent of whatever circumstances led to their deaths crimson avenger once targeted wildcat for causing a man s death but wildcat revealed that his victim had already killed his own brother and the man s wife and son after they killed his fiancé wildcat planted evidence to frame the dead man for his fiancé s murder as he couldn t prove the man s real crime and it was up to the legal system if the dead man was executed afterwards following dc comics 2011 reboot of their publishing line a
