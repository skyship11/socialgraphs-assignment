publication history edit both jeffrey and jason burr were created by jack kirby for a proposed dc comics series called king kobra the first issue of which was both written and drawn by kirby this first issue then sat in dc inventory for over a year during which time kirby left the publisher to return to marvel comics 2 eventually the concept was handed over to writer martin pasko with orders to make a series out of it pasko was unimpressed with king kobra feeling it to be a throwaway idea churned out by kirby as he was preparing to leave dc and tried to make the best out of the assignment by whiting out all of kirby s original dialogue rescripting the issue and having pablo marcos redraw some of the art 2 now titled simply kobra the first issue of the series appeared in late 1975 cover dated february 1976 it was cancelled after seven issues though the contents of the unpublished kobra 8 saw print in dc special series 1 pasko later reflected i wrote all of kobra with my tongue firmly planted in my cheek it was a preposterous exercise dumped in my lap and it helped pay the rent on a very nice place in the village 2 kobra is also featured in a january 2009 faces of evil one shot written by ivan brandon 3 fictional character biography edit jeffrey franklin burr edit kobra is an international terrorist and mad scientist who has crossed paths with the majority of earth s costumed heroes during his attempts to usher in the kali yuga an age of chaos his real name is jeffrey franklin burr and he was born part of a set of conjoined twins but was stolen at birth by the cult of the kobra god since a prophecy claimed he would lead them to rule the world 4 under their teaching he became a dangerous warrior and a sadistic criminal mastermind he led the cult into using advanced technology to menace the world followers of kobra would frequently address their master as naja naja naja naja being the binomial name for the indian cobra this later became nāga naga a meaningless title which translates from the sanskrit as snake snake whether this change was intentional or an error is not known 5 unbeknownst to the cult however he had a psychic link to his twin brother jason who knew nothing of kobra as a result one felt what the other felt including pain because of this his brother was recruited by an international agency to help them combat kobra 6 at first kobra was unable to kill or even hurt his brother eventually however he used a device that shut off the psychic link and gave him the chance to kill jason 7 kobra was subsequently haunted by visions of his brother whether it really was his ghost or just kobra s imagination was never revealed in subsequent years kobra would clash with assorted superheroes including batman whom he first met over a lazarus pit of his own creation kobra had learned to build modified lazarus pits which allowed him to control the minds of those he killed and resurrected kobra is the only person in the dc
