injustice society who began battling the justice society of america in all star comics 37 october 1947 4 5 fictional character biography edit henry king sr was born in the early 1910s as a metahuman with vast mental attributes an introvert he found solace in reading books and he one day learned to create three dimensional images of the characters from them such as sir lancelot of the round table he had developed a crush on a neighbor girl named lucy who eventually married his acquaintance edwin ackerman causing king tremendous jealousy as an adult king was a college and later medical school graduate obtaining a psychiatry degree he decided to use his now more fully developed image projecting abilities in a secret life of crime when henry s powers grew his head grew abnormally tall and he lost all his hair his first criminal act was creating thought constructs that stole money needed by him to fund his new activities he then became a crime lord in early 1942 brain wave contacted professor elba developer of the insanity serum augmented by brain wave s mental abilities it was administered to people around the nation causing them to commit crimes professor elba was defeated by the justice society of america when he tried to inject johnny thunder with it doctor mid nite caused him to inject himself and he was killed when he fell out of a window 6 noticing this team of vigilantes brain wave approached individual members of the jsa as psychiatrist dr henry king implanting a post hypnotic suggestions to assemble at the 1939 world s fair perisphere he attached each of the jsaers except green lantern to a mental chamber which immersed them in a fantasy of wartime conflict brain wave next assembled the all star squadron at the world s fair s trylon tower imprisoning each of them in the same device once green lantern was connected to the device his willpower proved too great for the chamber and its orchestrator leaving it in ruins and king mentally unstable in 1943 brain wave again battled the justice society when its individual members traced various criminal operations back to dr king at this time he vented his revenge on edwin ackerman starman tracked king to his office of psychiatry but was unable to produce sufficient proof to arrest the villain each of the jsaers plus heroines wonder woman hawkgirl inza cramer dian belmont doris lee and peachy pet thunder who were dressed as their male counterparts eventually converged on king s sharktooth bay tower he used images of their boyfriends to capture them but when he tried to gas the group wonder woman broke her fetters and went after king who jumped off of his tower to his presumed death however king s smock was caught on the limb of a tree as he fell thus saved he sought revenge by utilizing his shrinking ray device to shrink the jsaers to a height of 8 inches he lured wonder woman away by having the minutes from the past jsa meetings stolen she went to get the copies and while she was gone brain wave shrunk the male members and took them with him storing them as trophies in his lair king left his foes to meet with his minions with the aid of hawkman s bird allies the jsaers left to confront the criminal henchmen directly as they attempted to commit crimes eventually johnny thunder commanded his thunderbolt to restore each member to their proper height and when he got into trouble his thunderbolt got the other members to the tower the jsa then converged once more at the sharktooth bay tower but didn t realize that the road leading there was mined thunderbolt teleported the bombs underneath the tower and brain wave seemed to die once again he survived this time because the stones shielded him from the blast king adopted the alias of dream psychologist dr forest malone in 1946 he petitioned his adversaries to subject themselves to his experimental dream analyzer this device slowly drove each member towards insanity for example hawkman thought he was a thermometer the atom thought he was a sponge doctor mid nite thought he was an infectious disease and the green lantern thought he was the sun and that three balloons were his planets only johnny thunder was unaffected he was a wacky thinker anyway and as such was immune to the plot and actually became sane with the assistance of thunderbolt king was this time apprehended and placed in jail though a blow to the head restored johnny to his normal state king escaped confinement in 1947 and joined the wizard s first incarnation of the injustice society of the world each member was given an army of prison escapees from five mass jailbreaks the isw engineered and assigned to steal a key item from the government and to capture or kill a jsa member green lantern arrived in uthorium town just as armed forces were closing in on the criminals that controlled the city suddenly the town disappeared in a flash of light g l began a search for the criminal army and discovered that the town had re appeared a few miles away and that the felons were looting uthorium from a lab the emerald crusader zoomed in for an attack when brain wave appeared and opened a canister of uthorium in his presence blinded g l formed an energy bubble for protection while brain wave and his men finished their jobs recovering later green lantern discovered a radioactive trail left behind by the uthorium and followed it discovering some of the thugs with an invention called the mirage thrower which fooled the drivers of army tanks into crossing a frozen lake that wasn t really frozen g l saved the tanks and men then followed a trail to discover brain wave inside a weird glass box firing his power ring at it the ray bounced back knocking the emerald crusader off a cliff to his apparent death lantern s power ring saved him at the last moment and he freed his teammates who had all been captured by the isw and put on a mock trial he got to them by capturing and impersonating the thinker and captured king and his colleagues when superman disappeared for a year due to a spell cast by the wizard it was mentioned that brain wave claimed he had been behind it in point of fact however the wizard had been hired by colonel edmond h future so that superman would not be able to thwart future s high profile crime wave ultimately the wizard was eventually persuaded to bring superman back it turned out only superman s memory of being superman had been taken proving the wizard was behind it 7 in 1976 king appeared again as a villain this time insane after his many years in solitary confinement he blamed the justice society for his punishment using the sheer power of his brain as well as devices reconstructed from his days with the injustice society he created a space station headquarters which orbited the earth his desire was to collect many of the beautiful art objects of the earth to have a new body constructed for himself and to eventually destroy the jsa in order to accomplish his second goal he sought out and found a very diminished per degaton another jsa villain and founding isw member now nothing but a homeless vagrant he brought degaton to his space station and used his scientific devices to rejuvenate him by tapping into the will energy of the jsaers and feeding that energy into degaton brain wave set up three disasters and transmitted the information anonymously to the jsa s computer the disasters would take place in seattle washington cape town south africa and peking china the transmission also caused the jsa computer to conclude the total destruction of life on earth if these disasters were not averted the jsa hawkman flash doctor mid nite wildcat doctor fate and green lantern split into teams and traveled to those cities in an attempt to investigate and stop the destruction their actions resulted in the team gaining the help of robin the star spangled kid and a woman they had never yet met before power girl who helped stop a volcano it was power girl who discovered that brain wave was behind the disasters using the jsa s sky rocket a re usable spacecraft the flash wildcat and power girl entered earth orbit in search of brain wave s satellite they were later joined by the other heroes together they fought brain wave and degaton yet they almost lost the battle when brain wave used his powers to set the earth on a collision course with the sun when power girl pushed the satellite away from the earth and toward the sun the heat caused the villains to pass out the electronic devices shorted the battle ended and the powerhouses of the jsa brought the team and the villains back to earth in 1977 less than a year later brain wave appeared again no longer incarcerated but within jsa headquarters as a member of the regathered injustice society the icicle the wizard and the thinker the villainous team had captured both hourman and wildcat and issued a challenge to the jsa you must battle us for their lives at

and abilities edit both king sr and jr have a variety of mental powers king sr was originally much stronger but upon his death he somehow passed his powers on to his son vastly increasing king jr s power level chief among their powers is telepathy both are able to dominate many minds at once and cause people to see illusions or even have complete control over them proximity seems key to the effectiveness of this power even though it had no defined range king jr mentioned how even strong wills could not resist him when he was right next to them while many telepaths filter out the thoughts of others king jr allows the millions of minds he constantly comes across to flow freely through his mind lesser used powers of the kings include telekinesis the creation of realistic three dimensional holograms and the ability to fire blasts of psionic energy in other media edit brain wave appears in the superman 50th anniversary special portrayed by robert smigel a variation of brain
