batman eternal fictional character biography edit origin edit thomas tommy elliot was a childhood friend of bruce wayne and was also born into a wealthy family 3 the two boys often played a stratego esque minifigure game together and tommy taught bruce to think like his opponents and to use their abilities against them in order to win which proved useful years later when he became batman thus as a child tommy exhibits a genius level intellect due to his capability to think and plan strategically tommy despised both his abusive father and his frail submissive mother who came from poverty and willingly endured every abuse dealt to her and her son to keep her lavish lifestyle for all their failings however tommy s parents made sure he was well educated in particular teaching him about the philosophy of aristotle which he often quotes driven by his desire for independence and wealth tommy severed the brake line of his parents car causing a crash that killed his father and injured his mother his mother however was saved in an emergency operation by dr thomas wayne which enraged young elliot while at a summer camp with bruce tommy attacked a boy and ended up in a psychiatric ward he blamed bruce and his mother for his outburst he is released by an intern named jonathan crane who becomes the villain scarecrow during the next few years tommy tended to his mother when bruce s parents were murdered tommy resented him for inheriting the wayne family fortune just as he had hoped to do with his parents money shortly before bruce returned to gotham city tommy befriended a young woman named peyton riley who would later become the second ventriloquist a relationship of which his mother never approved when tommy s mother recovered from cancer she disowned him subsequently cutting him off from the elliot family fortune in retaliation for his continuing relationship with peyton as a result tommy murdered her by smothering her with a pillow while peyton killed their lawyer and destroyed mrs elliot s new will as far as the rest of the world was concerned his mother had died of a household accident finally the sole recipient of his family s fortune tommy abandoned peyton and began traveling the world as bruce had although he went on to harvard university and became a successful surgeon tommy continued to harbor an irrational grudge towards his childhood friend at some point in his career edward nygma also known as the riddler was diagnosed with terminal cancer and eventually hijacked one of ra s al ghul s lazarus pits to regain his health during this mystical treatment which renders the participant temporarily insane the riddler experienced an unexpected epiphany he realized that bruce wayne was batman soon afterwards the riddler attempted to sell tommy the secrets of his newfound revelation in exchange for a large cash sum tommy by this time having discovered nygma s criminal background instead offered to pay him to kill bruce realizing that they shared a common hatred for wayne tommy and the riddler decided to pool resources to bring him down to this end elliot created for himself the persona of hush riddler said that the name started out as a joking reference to the need to keep tommy s identity secret but became a more permanent alias when scarecrow started to sing the lullaby hush little baby 4 hush character arc edit in their attempt to destroy batman hush and the riddler manipulated several other villains into unwillingly helping them these included the joker harley quinn two face poison ivy scarecrow killer croc and clayface they even manipulated some of batman s closest allies superman huntress and catwoman against the dark knight utilizing such methods as poison ivy using her pheromones to control the man of steel and catwoman and hush s seemingly benevolent funding of huntress s vigilante activities part of their plot included fooling bruce into believing the joker had murdered tommy clayface shapeshifted into tommy s corpse in order to create this illusion cover to batman hush vol 2 december 2003 pencils by jim lee with these villains as their pawns hush and the riddler set up an elaborate plot against batman jason todd who was believed to be dead for years entered the pact with the villains and gave them insights on how batman thought using the shapeshifting abilities of clayface they created a decoy of the former robin hush collaborated with riddler todd and clayface to use the dark knight s guilt over his ward s apparent death against him at todd s gravesite 5 6 7 around this time hush cured the disfigured harold allnut a longtime associate of batman in return harold bugged the batcave with several devices that altered batman s mind but nevertheless remained loyal to the caped crusader he was certain that batman would triumph over whatever followed hush then killed harold in front of batman and immediately engaged the dark knight in battle batman was at first disoriented by hush s quoting of aristotle prompting him to briefly wonder if hush is maxie zeus he noticed that hush used deadshot s two gun fighting style and theorized that he was either the assassin himself or one of his protégés when tommy finally revealed himself to a worn out batman the dark knight was saved only by the intervention of harvey dent whose two face persona had been unwittingly wiped out by tommy when he repaired dent s disfigured face once again on the side of the law dent shot hush twice throwing him off a bridge although batman was sure that hush was his childhood friend thomas elliot he was not able to unmask him 8 hush returns edit still out to destroy batman and determined not to let the rest of the villains get in his way hush quickly carved out a niche for himself beating his former accomplice the riddler to within an inch of his life hush even drives the joker out of the city thus proving to the clown prince that hush can be a threat to him he also temporarily killed poison ivy during a failed attempt to recruit her hush returns cover to batman gotham knights 60 december 2004 pencils by jae lee following a short lived alliance with jla nemesis prometheus hush began to torment bruce wayne with help from clayface exploiting the latter s shapeshifting abilities hush was briefly able to shed doubt on his true identity and had alfred pennyworth framed for murder using samples taken from the new clayface to infect alfred with a virus that would allow elliot to control him hush also attempted to analyse samples taken from clayface with the goal of duplicating clayface s shape shifting abilities for himself without the usual side effects such as loss of a default human form eventually attempting to perfect this analysis by releasing cassius payne from prison reasoning that samples from cassius would be more useful as he is the only pure clayface the only one who was never human in the first place after clayface realised that he was being manipulated he provided batman with a sample of himself to find a cure for alfred s condition despite knowing that this would not leave batman with time to cure him and also ensured that alfred s name would be cleared by ensuring that his final appearance after death would be a form whose fingerprints so closely resembled alfred s that the detectives would assume that they had made a mistake the aforementioned events occur in issue 50 55 and 61 72 payback edit the joker eventually returned to gotham city with an army of trained pigeons and retaliated in batman gotham knights 73 74 he captured hush and kept him sedated for three weeks during which time he implanted a pacemaker into his body effectively gaining control of his heart at the joker s mercy and unable to remove the device himself hush turned to the one man he felt he could trust or rather predict bruce wayne bruce consented to help hush on the condition that he allow himself to be treated in and confined to arkham asylum hush agreed and then immediately escaped after being told that the surgery had been a success he was intercepted by batman before he could confront the joker and demanded that batman allow him to kill the joker batman seemed to agree and began to leave but then revealed that he had tricked hush the pacemaker was still in his body and he had been allowed to escape from arkham at that moment the joker arrived and hush begged batman not to leave him the issue and the batman gotham knights series ended unresolved hush returned in the later man bat miniseries 9 and is later shown remembering how painful it was to remove the pacemaker alone and how the time between gotham knights and heart of hush was mostly spent recovering from the damage suffered confirming that batman did desert hush at the conclusion of payback heart of hush edit main article heart of hush hush returns in detective comics 846 850 in the story heart of hush which ties together with batman r i p in this arc set a few nights before the events depicted in r i p hush is portrayed in a slightly different thematic fashion than in his prior appearances his past as a surgeon serves as an important thematic aspect of his modus operandi in the first issue hush reveals that his return was hastened when he began to hear whispers of the black glove s upcoming attack on batman hush seeks to prevent black glove from killing batman which hush sees as his right alone in the second part hush teams up with the scarecrow he performs routine plastic surgery on his own face which is later

which is being kept alive through artificial means he then confesses to batman his plan using his newfound resemblance to bruce he will kill and disfigure him to steal his identity eliminating those who know him best and regularly interact with him after which he will retire with the wayne fortune reasoning that batman s fellow superheroes will accept that batman has earned the right to end his career however batman is able to stave off the effects of the paralytic gas recover catwoman s heart and warn alfred of hush s deception although alfred disarms elliot hush manages to get the batcave where he nearly kills batman but alfred s continued interference and the arrival of nightwing and robin turned the tide hush retreats on the whirly bat a one man helicopter but his bandages become tangled in the rotor causing the vehicle to explode in searching for traces of hush batman nightwing and robin find only some bloody bandages and conclude that he is dead doctor mid nite surgically restores catwoman s heart but notes that she is unlikely to ever regain her physical prowess while convalescing she and her allies find all of hush s secret bank accounts and loots those funds for themselves which she documents in a video that she ultimately leaves for hush to find in the event that he survived hush revealed to be indeed alive but wounded and crutch bound sees this video before

with nightwing and robin incarcerates him in a secret safe house hush still wearing bruce s appearance decides to fake his surrender waiting for the right moment to escape batman reborn edit in streets of gotham batman s biological son damian wayne visited hush in his cell as the new robin and they played chess when damian left to deal with a new crisis hush surmised that firefly was behind the attack he noted how gotham city had fallen apart in batman s absence and pondered how to use the current situation to his advantage 11 hush faked experiencing spontaneous combustion and when alfred arrived at his cell to assist hush overpowered him and escaped he then re emerged as bruce wayne claiming that he would donate a billion dollars a month to gotham city until the financial crisis was over dick and damian along with the outsiders and assorted other superheroes explained to hush that they would always watch and control him with the other heroes acting as a board of directors intended to supervise his financial dealings and that someone will always be ready to take him down if he steps out of line with no other option available to him hush reluctantly agreed to play dick grayson s puppet posing as bruce wayne and thus keeping the public from realizing that bruce was dead 12 though this ruined his original plan to sap the wayne fortune hush did not allow it to halt his scheming altogether hush had appeared notably as a member of the gotham shield committee around gotham quite frequently often attempting to make connections when ra s al ghul arrived in gotham promising to ruin the wayne family in retaliation against red robin he immediately sought out hush 13 faced with the prospect of hush using ra s al ghul s support to turn on the bat family again tim drake activated a contingency plan set in place by wayne himself to transfer controlling interest in wayne enterprises to drake if something should happen this left hush with no official standing in the company 14 house of hush edit hush reappeared in streets of gotham for the story arc house of hush beginning in 14 15 he attempted to push the boundaries of his new role as bruce wayne such as recommending that convicted criminals be allowed back on the streets however this plan backfired when the criminal jane doe a woman who lost her face in an accident and had resorted to cutting off the faces of others became obsessed with bruce wayne after he had her released she infiltrated his life by taking the face of his new assistant and subsequently cut off elliot s new face with the intention of becoming bruce wayne herself the returned bruce wayne once again acting as batman caught her and hush and they were both sent to arkham bruce declaring that he was batman s financial backer to make any attempt hush might make to expose his identity basically irrelevant during the events of batman gates of gotham hush was freed from arkham by a new villain named the architect as this happened red robin batman and blackbat realized that the elliot family was connected to a series of bombings that destroyed three historical gotham bridges batman found hush who had been betrayed by the architect and strapped to a bomb but was forced to sacrifice wayne tower to save his life 16 the new 52 batman eternal edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline hush first appears in issue twenty one of batman eternal as the apparent mastermind behind commissioner gordon s downfall and carmine falcone s return after injecting alfred with fear toxin hush was seen communicating with jason bard about taking control of gotham 17 in issue twenty six a slightly revised origin for hush was revealed he was still tommy elliott a childhood friend of bruce wayne but in this version his parricide is explicitly described as a way for him to get closer to bruce who had started distancing himself from tommy after the death of his own parents rather than as a way for him to receive his inheritance 18 hush turned public opinion against wayne enterprises by blowing up one of batman s hidden weapon caches known to be connected to wayne enterprises after the events of batman incorporated below gotham killing an unknown number of civilians policemen and military personnel he was able to enter the cache with dna taken from alfred pennyworth 19 after having blown up another weapon cache and having been shot through the shoulder with a grappling hook by julia pennyworth hush gave up his location to batman to face him in a final showdown they met and fought in a weapon cache below the martha wayne foundation hospital which hush had rigged to explode as a backup plan batman defeated hush but was then informed that the government had seized control of wayne enterprises and its holdings due to its involvement in the catastrophic explosions around gotham hush then taunted batman stating maybe you re right bruce maybe i m not you but right now who would want to be 20 hush was then kept as prisoner in the batcave but broke out with the help of the then unknown mastermind behind the current threat hush proceeded to sabotage the equipment of several members of the batman family via the batcomputer as they fought various villains including crashing the batwing with batman still in it he was then returned to captivity after having been ambushed by alfred pennyworth alfred harshly informing hush that he was hardly going to be locked up in his own home 21 all star batman edit in all star batman 10 hush secretly allies himself with penguin black mask and great white shark in order to trick batman into procuring a macguffin called the genesis engine for them the ruse succeeds but hush and his allies are then ambushed and nearly murdered by the new villain nemesis 22 dc rebirth edit after dc comics new line wide relaunch rebirth hush first appeared in a single panel cameo in issue 19 of batman vol 3 wherein he is an inmate at arkham asylum and beaten up by bane 23 then in the one shot batman prelude to the wedding nightwing vs hush 1 hush is tipped off to batman s upcoming wedding by the joker hush attempts to attack batman s bachelor party causing a disaster to distract superman and then attacking batman and nightwing in the course of the confrontation hush s attack disrupts a dimensional gate superman had provided that was intended to take batman to a peaceful pocket universe resulting in hush and nightwing being trapped in an in between place for individuals who have lost all sense of individual identity as hush s rants affirm his inability to forge a life for himself outside of an obsession with bruce wayne he reveals that he has given himself plastic surgery to look like dick grayson to try and recapture his old friendship with bruce ultimately hush is left behind in the pocket dimension despite nightwing s attempts to help him 24 however in batman vol 3 70 hush is apparently back in arkham asylum as he is one of several villains batman beats up during his escape after having been captured and subjected to mental torture by scarecrow the flashpoint batman and bane 25 later hush is shown to be a member of bane s police force after he had taken control over the institutions of gotham hush duels with batman but loses 26 he was likely kept obedient through hypnosis by the psycho

newspapers books scholar jstor february 2021 learn how and when to remove this template message personality edit being a victim of abuse and a neglectful submissive mother rendered thomas elliot sociopathic before even his teenage years he was already operating on a high level of sociopathy going so far as severing the brake line of his parents car to gain independence from them and inherit the elliot family fortune when bruce wayne s parents died and he inherited the wayne family fortune as well as independence from them the very two things tommy sought to gain from his parents death tommy developed an irrational hatred for his childhood friend spawned from the fact bruce s father thomas wayne was the one who operated on and saved his mother foiling the young elliot s plan of patricide and that via the death of his parents bruce had gained everything he wanted this deep rooted hatred would then carry on into tommy s adulthood resulting in him adopting his hush persona elliot also seems to be obsessed with mystery and subterfuge preferring to operate from the shadows and having cast doubts over his own identity and motivations several times this obsession seems somewhat linked to elliot s own arrogance seeking to prove his superiority over his opponents in heart of hush he also displays misogynistic and classist leanings apparently the result of life under his controlling mother elliot frequently quotes aristotle skills and abilities edit thomas tommy elliot has spent most of his life honing his skills enough to be a match for the dark knight one of the world s finest surgeons thomas elliot has an incredible genius level intellect and is also a master planner with tactical skills rivaling those of the caped crusader hush s greatest asset is his talent for thinking like his opponents and for using their abilities against them ironically bruce wayne learned his strategic skills from elliot in childhood before their respective parents deaths hush is an expert marksman able to shoot two batarangs out of the air and set off c4 explosive using twin m1911 45 caliber pistols his weapons of choice while not possessing the kind of martial arts training that bruce wayne acquired hush has proven his ability to fight hand to hand he shows expertise and competence being able to fight almost on par with batman he has performed breakthrough medical operations such as removing harold allnut s hunchback and giving him the ability to speak repairing harvey dent s face inventing a virus which accelerates killer croc s devolution and tearing out catwoman s heart without doing any lasting damage hush is also able to perform plastic surgery on himself using minimal anesthetic and sheer force of will he s implied to have removed the pacemaker installed on his own heart by himself and has shown the ability to grant himself the appearance of someone else such as bruce wayne using only a long series of planned surgeries on his own face with the aid of a simple mirror thomas elliot previously had access to the vast resources of his family fortune putting him on par with bruce wayne in wealth and so he is able to fund his more expensive plans he is also able to buy the cooperation of the main villains in gotham like mr freeze however since the heart of hush storyline catwoman has tapped his resources reducing him to poverty he then put in motion a plan to use his newfound resemblance to bruce wayne to leech off the wayne fortune cutting off the batman family from it as well this plan was thwarted when he underestimated his foes finding himself merely a puppet of the batman family and their allies as he serves to create the impression that bruce wayne is still alive other versions edit batman beyond edit the 2010 batman beyond miniseries revealed that bruce wayne s last fight with hush occurred on a rainy night and consisted primarily of a rooftop chase as a last minute means of escape elliot dove into an open window only to be shot by the homeowner who mistook him for an invader with batman severely injured and not on good terms with the police he left hush s body without examining it himself bruce seemed initially satisfied with the official police identification of the body as elliot s however he later admits suspecting that hush s skill for strategy and plastic surgery could have fabricated the entire scenario some time after the events of batman beyond return of the joker terry mcginnis discovers the former signalman murdered in a manner reminiscent of two face s m o he subsequently tracks the murderer to a hospital where an aged jervis tetch is being held and finds a bandaged man standing over a badly injured nurse the man flees as terry rushes over to the nurse who says the man

umbrellas the penguin s weapon of choice attempting to stay ahead of their foe terry and bruce search out the calendar man julian gregory day upon confronting day terry is suddenly ambushed by hush who broke in beforehand 30 during terry s fight with the new hush it is revealed that this hush is not only capable of matching the current batman in a fight but is also aware of bruce wayne s identity as batman he regards terry as an impostor with no understanding of what it means to be batman he also regards his murders of batman s rogues gallery as orphaning batman all over again by killing his enemies as the only loving family he has had hush escapes by throwing the calendar man out the window with a bomb attached to day s chest terry chooses to try and save day but fails confirming that tim drake was under constant physical and psychological observation since his time as the joker terry eliminates drake as a suspect and proceeds to confront dick grayson meanwhile hush is revealed to have hired the new catwoman to plant a tracking device on batman before proceeding to strangle her as part of his vendetta a brief scene with amanda waller and a woman identified as

as batman bruce intervenes in hush s attempt to kill catwoman hush demonstrates a knowledge of bruce s old methods including his equipment trials with alfred and his habit of making the logo on his chest heavily armoured and manages to shut down the robot hush then proceeds to attempt to hack the bat wraith which forces bruce to use the self destruct terry subsequently attempts to trap hush by posing as current bat foe mad stan only to be defeated and exposed by hush s use of shriek s technology hush unmasks himself appearing to be a bitter and enraged dick grayson 32 he spares bruce and terry so that they can witness him in action saving gotham bruce then directs the new catwoman on how to treat terry s injuries the new hush is subsequently revealed as a clone of grayson waller determined to provide the world with a batman cloned grayson based on dna and memory readings taken after grayson s last fight as nightwing waller believed that grayson was more stable than bruce and would therefore be easier to control doctor reid also reveals herself to be the granddaughter of the original hush nora elliot before her marriage seeking to atone for her grandfather s sins 33 hush sends a transmission to the batcave revealing that he has taken control of the bat wraiths he threatens to destroy gotham in order to save it by setting off bombs along a fault line and triggering a new earthquake the wounded terry is aided by dick grayson despite bruce and terry s concerns about his old injuries they are joined by catwoman who is seeking revenge for hush s attack on her the three track down hush but are unable to convince him that he is merely a clone the group is only able to defeat him when bruce temporarily overrides hush s control of the bat wraiths hush is then accidentally impaled and killed on a bat wraith when terry throws him off of the real grayson the clone being impaled by a bat wraith coming out of a pit that it had previously fallen into before both fall back into the pit terry grimly notes that the lack of a body means they can only think the clone is dead rather than being sure of it waller later had reid taking the blames for hush s actions in
