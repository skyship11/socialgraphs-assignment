and jerry ordway 4 he was believed to have been destroyed in crisis on infinite earths 12 only to return after a long absence in green lantern sinestro corps special 1 august 2007 fictional character biography edit origins edit during the crisis on infinite earths it was revealed how the existence of all parallel universes in the multiverse came to be including the positive matter multiverse and also the anti matter universe and how the monitor and the anti monitor came into existence when the menace posed by the anti monitor became apparent several villains were sent back in time to stop him but were defeated by krona and the other oans citation needed in a final revision it was established that it increased entropy in the universe shortening its existence by a billion years see heat death 5 in any event two beings were created one on the moon of oa and the other on the moon of qward on the moon of oa the being known as the monitor was instantly aware of his counterpart the anti monitor although his official name is the monitor in his own universe and he is often addressed as such the name anti monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart by this time the anti monitor had quickly conquered qward as well as the rest of the anti matter universe citation needed in searching for other places to conquer he also became aware of his counterpart these two beings battled for a million years unleashing great powers against each other but to no avail at the end of their stalemate they simultaneously attacked one another rendering both inert for nine billion years citation needed in final crisis it was revealed that in the wake of the birth of the original multiverse an unfathomable being of limitless imagination the original monitor or overmonitor became aware of the life germinating in the budding multiverse occupying the void space in which he resided and which he encompassed curious about it and wanting to interact with and know better the lesser life forms birthed by the multiverse he fashioned a probe a smaller monitor unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time the probe monitor was instantly split into two symmetrical opposite beings upon coming into contact with the multiverse itself the monitor embodying the positive matter and goodness and the anti monitor embodying anti matter and evil 6 the anti monitor who appears monstrous barely resembles the monitor who bears a physically near human appearance the anti monitor has empty sometimes luminous eye sockets and a wide wrinkled mouth often mistaken for a mass of teeth when his armor is destroyed by supergirl his form appears not dissimilar to that of the monitor but unstable and surrounded by a coruscating aura of radiant energy his life force leaking out like water from a failing vessel explaining the need for the armor the anti monitor himself refers to the armor as his life shell 7 when the manhunters re build his armor it is revealed his body is little more than a churning mass of energy 8 much later when his helmet is disintegrated by firestorm the anti monitor s head is revealed to be featureless except for his eyes and mouth 9 crisis on infinite earths edit main article crisis on infinite earths the anti monitor at war with the multiverse s heroes on crisis on infinite earths 12 march 1986 art by george pérez in more modern times the being known as pariah performed an experiment similar to the one krona attempted long ago on a parallel earth this was changed later to an alternate world in the post crisis single universe citation needed this experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the monitor and the anti monitor and the destruction of pariah s earth and his universe citation needed the anti monitor rebuilt his army taking over qward and using the thunderers as his own private army as well as creating the shadow demons from the elite of the thunderers citation needed the anti monitor then released a massive anti matter wave absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes and growing stronger even as his counterpart grew weaker and employed the second psycho pirate using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy citation needed the monitor along with his aide harbinger gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the anti monitor 10 one of harbinger s duplicates was taken control of by the anti monitor and apparently killed the monitor but the monitor was able to use his death to create a pocket universe to contain the remaining realities from the anti monitor s attack after defeats by various heroes including the flash barry allen and supergirl sacrificing themselves to destroy an anti matter cannon 11 and to save superman 7 respectively the anti monitor absorbed the entirety of the anti matter universe and traveled to the beginning of time intending to stop the formation of the positive matter multiverse and to create a multiverse where anti matter prevailed when the heroes followed him there he began to drain the power from most of them citation needed however the actions of the spectre empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving earths brought the anti monitor to a stalemate the villains of said earths sent to stop krona from viewing the origins of the universe failed due to squabbling allowing krona to see the hands of the anti monitor and the spectre struggling for domination which collapsed the current multiverse citation needed from the ashes rose a new singular universe while various persons adjusted to the newly singular earth including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the multiverse the anti monitor enraged drew this new earth into the anti matter universe intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all 12 what followed was the shadow demon war wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the anti monitor s forces finally the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains most notably doctor light the heroic alexander luthor jr of earth three darkseid superboy of earth prime and kal l the superman of earth two were able to weaken the anti monitor enough for kal l to deliver the final blow destroying the anti monitor by punching him into a star the star went nova and caused anti matter waves to erupt threatening to destroy the entire anti matter universe kal l and superboy prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates when alexander luthor using his power to open dimensions revealed that he had created a paradise dimension and he used it to prevent the lois lane kent of earth two from being erased from existence when the post crisis universe was formed as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss using his own body as a portal alexander luthor kal l and superboy prime went into the paradise dimension alongside lois 13 among the other beings who died because of his actions were the entire crime syndicate of america kid psycho nighthawk the losers flower of easy company starman the immortal man the dove kole clayface ii the bug eyed bandit the angle man prince ra man sunburst lori lemaris aquagirl earth 2 s green arrow huntress robin and alexander luthor sr of earth three just to name a few infinite crisis edit main article infinite crisis the anti monitor s corpse turned into a tower panel from infinite crisis 3 february 2006 art by phil jimenez the superman and lois lane of earth two superboy of earth prime and alexander luthor jr of earth three were revealed to be observing the events of the newly formed universe as well as the actions of its heroes from their home in the hidden pocket universe upon observing the events leading up to infinite crisis the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore earth two s existence at the expense of earth one 14 the anti monitor s remains were then used by alexander luthor as part of a tuning fork similar to the ones used during the first crisis this construct then created the vibrational frequency that earth two was on prior to its non existence which in turn recreated earth two with no visible effect on earth one save the movement of characters who originated on earth two to the recreated earth two 15 alexander luthor then recreated the other earths with his tuning fork with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said earths citation needed superboy prime followed soon by bart allen then returned from the speed force wearing what appeared to be select elements of the anti monitor s armor using it as a yellow sunlight collector 16 ultimately the tower was destroyed when kon el the modern superboy and superboy prime crashed into it while fighting each other forcing all of the earths to merge into a new earth once again kon el died in the arms of wonder girl as superboy prime fled 17 post crisis impact edit despite his extremely limited exposure he only appeared in the crisis on infinite earths miniseries a single issue of wonder woman 18 and the flash vol 2 149 150 citation needed the anti monitor was responsible for one of the most profound changes in the entire history of dc comics the dc universe and all of its parallel universes the anti matter universe still existed now with both qward said to be the counterpart of oa and an alternate earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains each taking the opposite role among its planets 19 perhaps the most notable impact the anti monitor had on the post crisis universe was the elimination of the multiverse aspect of the dc universe previously there existed an infinite number of earths each one with a unique history that could be accessed through various means the most common being vibrational attunement during post crisis with the restart of the universe as one thanks to the machinations of the anti monitor a simpler more streamlined dc universe seemed imminent with characters acquired from charlton comics fawcett comics and quality comics all becoming incorporated into the new dc universe post infinite crisis edit the anti monitor resemblance seen in the background in dcu brave new world 1 art by ariel olivetti at the end of dc comics 2006 special brave new world it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves the monitors watching over the new post

that there are fifty two monitors with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new multiverse each with a slightly different appearance a monitor was shown in supergirl recalling dark angel one of his agents this monitor was dressed like the anti monitor but appeared to have no other connection 21 sinestro corps edit prominent members of the sinestro corps with a manhunter at far left including clockwise from top left hank henshaw superboy prime the anti monitor parallax inhabiting kyle rayner and sinestro art by ethan van sciver it was revealed that the anti monitor was reborn following the recreation of the multiverse and that he had been fueling sinestro s ideology since the return of hal jordan acting as the sinestro corps guardian of fear 22 his body was rebuilt by the manhunters and in addition he recruited superboy prime the cyborg superman and parallax who was using kyle rayner as its host along with sinestro as his heralds 23 during the war between the sinestro corps and the green lantern corps the anti monitor contacted cyborg superman to inquire about the status of new warworld citation needed the cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon qward and that he would kill henshaw for his services allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the cyborg 24 when the lost lanterns made their way to the anti matter universe to save hal jordan and the ion power they inadvertently stumbled upon the anti monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on qward citation needed he was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the ion entity previously inhabiting kyle rayner he proceeded to kill ke haan before the other lanterns forced him back taking the ion entity from the planet and the anti matter universe citation needed the anti monitor pursued the lanterns for a short while long enough for hal jordan guy gardner john stewart and the other lanterns to learn of his return citation needed having this vital information they then leave qward shortly after the sinestro corps launched its attack on earth the anti monitor traveled to the planet aboard new warworld and landed shortly thereafter along with sinestro 25 he was attacked by sodam yat and other members of the green lantern corps but the tyrant killed the two unnamed lanterns and severely injured the daxamite lantern 25 the anti monitor began to siphon the positive matter of new york city to create his anti matter waves however he was attacked by the guardians of the universe angry at being impotent during his first war the anti monitor was able to counter the vicious attack permanently disfiguring the face of scar 25 john stewart and guy gardner brought down new warworld and the yellow central power battery which were detonated next to the anti monitor and contained by a shield created by hundreds of green lanterns to contain the explosion even this was not enough to kill him superboy prime seeing an opportunity to defeat the now weakened anti monitor flew through the anti monitor s chest and hurled his shattered body into space 25 the anti monitor s corpse crash landed on desert planet where a voice later revealed to be nekron acknowledged him and told him to rise before he could escape the anti monitor found himself imprisoned inside a large black power battery 25 soon afterwards the guardian scar corrupted by the anti monitor s energies dispatched the green lanterns ash and saarek to locate and recover the anti monitor s body 26 blackest night edit main article blackest night green lanterns ash and saarek find the black central power battery on the dead planet ryut in sector 666 and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet killing them citation needed when the black central power battery is later brought to earth the anti monitor stirs within demanding to be let out he begins draining the white energies of dove in order to escape 27 the anti monitor is reanimated as a black lantern independent from nekron s control the anti monitor is attacked by the various lantern corps just as he is about to pull himself out of the battery combining their energies the various lantern corps use dove as a human bullet shooting the anti monitor through the head and pulling him back into the battery 28 the anti monitor is eventually resurrected by a white power ring and breaks free of the battery fighting nekron in revenge for imprisoning him nekron then banishes the anti monitor back to the anti matter universe 29 brightest day edit main article brightest day later the anti monitor is confronted by the white lantern boston brand 30 as brand is forced by the white ring to fight for his life damaging the anti monitor s chest plate armor the anti monitor retaliates by firing a burst of anti matter energy at brand who evades the blast the anti monitor resumes his duties in the anti matter universe while brand leaves 31 he also prevented deathstorm the black lantern version of firestorm in his attempt to destroy the white lantern battery and instead commands him to bring the lantern to him as well as an army at which point deathstorm brings back the black lantern versions of professor zoom maxwell lord hawk jade captain boomerang martian manhunter aquaman hawkman hawkgirl deadman and osiris 32 the anti monitor in brightest day 3 june 2010 art by ivan reis deathstorm eventually brought the white lantern battery to him and he tried to access the white lantern power however his efforts are prevented by firestorm who after engaging in battle with the anti monitor and the black lanterns is able to regain the white power battery from the anti monitor it is also revealed that the entity allowed itself to be captured so it could obtain unspecified information from the anti monitor 33 the new 52 edit the anti monitor was introduced in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe in the final page of the forever evil storyline it is revealed to the reader as the being which destroyed ultraman s krypton and earth 3 as he is seen finishing off earth 3 the anti monitor declares darkseid shall be mine 34 the anti monitor has found the prime earth because the ring of volthoom s energy signature was emitting a traceable pulse he was also responsible for blinding martian manhunter s earth 3 counterpart by burning out his eyes and destroying one of his arms beyond repair even by the capabilities that martians possess 35 when metron confronted the anti monitor amidst the ruins of earth 3 it was revealed the anti monitor was the former owner of metron s traveling device the mobius chair and that his true name is mobius he intends to make up for an unknown wrong he regrets and to this end intends to kill darkseid with the help of the latter s daughter 36 the half amazon half apokoliptian known as grail 37 with the help of grail the anti monitor attacks the justice league on prime earth while waiting for darkseid as he was promised by grail 38 it is eventually revealed that mobius became what he is after attempting to peer into the origins of the anti matter universe on qward similar to how krona sought the origins of his positive matter universe while the white light of the life equation was the origin of the positive universe it is the anti life equation that serves as the foundation of the anti matter universe and mobius released it from within the world of qward transforming him into the anti monitor with the anti life equation in his body anti monitor has the ability to enslave any living thing to his will he uses this power to bind the black racer to the flash enslaving the new god and using him to kill darkseid 39 having killed darkseid the anti monitor cocooned himself in a shell of energy and eventually separated himself from the anti life equation which was then obtained by grail 40 shortly afterward he emerged from his shell changed into a more human looking form once again mobius but still possessing vast power and legions of shadow demons 41 superwoman and wonder woman attempt to subdue him together with their respective lassos one compelling him to be truthful the other to obey but he defies and defeats both ultraman re empowered through a chunk of kryptonite engages mobius but is swiftly defeated and killed 42 next mobius is attacked by lex luthor now wielding the omega force formerly belonging to darkseid as well as an army of shadow demons even now fighting luthor as well as the justice league and the crime syndicate mobius has the upper hand until grail darkseid s daughter appears with steve trevor in tow she has transferred the anti life to him making him into a new vessel for its power now basically a living weapon under grail s control trevor releases a tremendous blast of power against mobius reducing him to a smoldering skeleton 43 dc rebirth edit in the dc rebirth relaunch anti monitor s history is revealed where he and his brothers monitor mar novu and world forger were created by a super celestial named perpetua in the sixth dimension where she tasked them to monitor their assigned realms anti monitor was tasked to make sure the light of creation didn t breach the greater omniverse if anti monitor his brothers or perpetua would be destroyed they would regenerate in the sixth dimension 44 the anti monitor lies in wait at the end of the universe where the former source wall was located he saved aquaman at the end of drowned earth and sends him into the past to aid the flash green lantern and the justice society of america s attempts in retrieving starman s cosmic rod and to head to atlantis to use the conch of arion to return everyone back to the present the anti monitor is confronted by perpetua and apex lex who try to convert him to their cause but are interrupted by the arrival of the monitor world forger hawkgirl and starman the anti monitor fuses with his brothers to become the ultra monitor and fight their mother they are able to hold back perpetua but due to doom s influence empowering her and hawkgirl straying from the plan the ultra monitor is defeated when perpetua gives the anti monitor the anti life back restoring him to his pre crisis appearance and changing allegiance to perpetua anti monitor is sent by perpetua to kill hawkgirl and shayne who perpetua has stranded in space and prevented from returning to earth before he can kill the two the anti monitor is struck by john stewart green lantern who was driving the flash s speed force car forcing the anti monitor back into his rebirth appearance and releasing the monitor and world forger the anti monitor cries out for his mother s help which he receives in the form of the fiery remains of earth 44 which perpetua flung towards his location 45 powers and abilities edit anti monitor is one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the dc universe he is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known dc supervillain having destroyed at least thousands of universes if not an actual infinitude of them 46 he was powerful enough to kill supergirl when she became distracted he consumed at least thousands of positive matter universes to increase his power and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse s strongest heroes simultaneously during the blackest night the anti monitor was reanimated as a black lantern however nekron was unable to fully control him and thus was only able to subdue the anti monitor to be used as a power source for the black lantern corps central battery much in the same way the entity parallax is the power source for the green lanterns battery the anti monitor was also responsible for the death of barry allen the hero better known as the flash after capturing barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable the anti monitor created an anti matter cannon that would destroy the then five remaining earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed the cannon was destroyed by the flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon s power source into itself causing it to explode and barry to disintegrate in addition to possessing vast size varying from about nine feet to hundreds of meters tall vastly superhuman strength extraordinary durability by the end of the crisis series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from superman and even surviving a blue star going supernova the ability to project destructive bolts of energy and greatly augmenting another being s powers as he did with psycho pirate whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle the anti monitor also possessed reality warping abilities which he displayed by removing psycho pirate s face the anti monitor also commanded an army of qwardians and shadow demons and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting merging or destroying entire universes by far his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself once he fused with his anti matter universe he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes in addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes he also absorbed the energy of over one million worlds in his own anti matter universe in order to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe when earth s heroes followed him to the beginning of time he then absorbed all of their power and energy this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the spectre during his final battle in crisis on infinite earths 12 the anti monitor maintained his power by feeding on a nearby star and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near death he absorbed his own anti matter demons to rejuvenate himself the anti monitor is not immortal but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti matter universe exists having been destroyed with an immense effort at the end of the crisis he was recreated by his universe just as he had been formed originally it s been revealed that if the anti monitor or any other member of his family were to be destroyed they would regenerate in the sixth dimension other versions edit in the chain lightning arc of the flash comics 47 history is altered when barry allen is killed before the events of crisis on infinite earths this forces wally west into a timeline
