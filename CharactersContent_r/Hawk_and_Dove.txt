steve skeates they appeared in showcase 75 june 1968 during the silver age of comic books 2 the duo has existed in multiple incarnations over the years across several eponymous ongoing series and miniseries and has also appeared in a number of recurring roles and guest appearances in titles such as teen titans birds of prey and brightest day the duo originated as teenage brothers hank hall as hawk and don hall as dove following don s death in crisis on infinite earths 1985 dawn granger assumed the role of dove in hawk dove 1 october 1988 the mantle of hawk would later be taken up by dawn s sister holly granger in 2003 after hank was killed during 1994 s zero hour crisis in time until her death and hank s resurrection in blackest night 2009 an unrelated team consisting of military cadet sasha martens as hawk and rock musician wiley wolverman as dove also appeared as the focus of a 1997 miniseries the pairing of hank and dawn serve as the current and most commonly published incarnation of the team inspired by the emerging political divides of the 1960s between pro war hawks and pacifist doves the central concept traditionally revolves around two young heroes with contrasting personalities and diametrically opposed ideologies who by speaking their superheroic aliases are transformed and granted power sets of heightened strength speed and agility with dove embodying reason and nonviolence and hawk embodying force and aggression the two heroes complement one another to effectively fight evil with the introduction of dawn granger it was revealed that hawk and dove receive their powers from the lords of chaos and order respectively and that their powers are mystic in origin though the duo s ongoing titles have all been relatively short lived and their guest appearances in other titles sporadic the heroes have experienced a storied and sometimes tragic history multiple characters have worn the respective titles of hawk and dove at one time or another and the legacy has experienced death resurrection and even hank s own descent into madness and subsequent transformation into the mass murdering villain monarch and later extant hank hall dawn

showcase debut hank and don hall received their own series titled the hawk and the dove created by plotter artist steve ditko and writer steve skeates 3 with carmine infantino coming up with the title 4 ditko plotted only the first issue and left after the second 5 in a 1999 interview skeates expressed dismay with changes that would be made to his script by ditko and editorial citing a tendency to neutralize dove s abilities as a crimefighter in favor of hawk s it was strange a lot of changes would happen after i turned in a script quite often my idea of what to do with the dove was have him do brave stuff and then it would be changed by either dick giordano or steve into the hawk doing that stuff they d say it was out of character for the dove they seemed to be equating dove with wimp wuss coward or whatever and i don t really think it was because they were more hawkish i just don t think that they knew what a dove was 6 although skeates attempted to change the direction of the series after ditko left and artist gil kane joined the creative team skeates himself left after the fourth issue leaving kane to take on both writing and art responsibilities until the book s cancellation due to low sales after only the sixth issue the original hawk and dove made sporadic appearances in different dc titles throughout the 1970s and 1980s primarily within the teen titans and new teen titans joining the original incarnation briefly from teen titans 25 30 january october 1970 under the guidance of writers dick giordano and robert kanigher and artist nick cardy skeates also provided scripts for some of these issues they appeared in the brothers also teamed up with batman in the brave and the bold 181 dec 1981 in an out of continuity tale written by alan brennert and drawn by jim aparo the original hawk and dove s last appearance together was in crisis on infinite earths 12 march 1986 in which don hall was killed and became one of the last of a multitude of characters to meet their demise throughout the series including the flash supergirl and dozens of others modern age edit following dove s death hawk and dove would appear together in various flashbacks while hawk would appear alone in occasional guest appearances in the teen titans titles including his own solo two part story in teen titans spotlight 7 8 february march 1987 by mike baron and jackson guice in 1986 karl kesel and barbara kesel began collaborating on a revival of hawk and dove with the idea of creating a second dove who would this time be a female that would later become dawn granger karl kesel stated i was inking the figure of the dead dove on george pérez s crisis spread in the history of the dc universe not crying tears over the death of the guy since he was pretty much a minor hero but regretting the end of a really interesting team i always liked hawk and dove i always thought how they d say hawk and dove and transform was really cool then it hit me the mysterious voice that gave hawk and dove their powers could easily give the dove powers to someone else maybe a woman i called barbara as soon as i could she sparked off the idea instantly and before even we knew it we were co writers 7 the revival was approved for a five issue miniseries and the kesels were joined by then up and coming artist rob liefeld the miniseries shortened from its 1968 title to simply hawk dove was published in 1988 1989 the revival veered away from the duo s silver age political leanings and told a more straightforward superhero story with human trappings introducing a number of supporting characters and villains that were loosely based on many of the kesels friends and family their portrayals of hank and dawn themselves were modeled on barbara kesel s brother and karl kesel s sister respectively this new direction was well received by fans and sold out 8 which then spurred the launch of an ongoing series with hawk dove vol 3 in june 1989 co written by the kesels with greg guler replacing liefeld on art chores the kesels also wrote a hawk and dove feature in secret origins 43 august 1989 that elaborated on the origin story of hank and don revealing that hawk and dove s powers were given to them by the lords of chaos and order and that hawk and dove themselves were agents of chaos and order respectively despite its strong start the relaunched ongoing series was eventually cancelled after 28 issues and two annuals with issue 28 being published in october 1991 to date this is the longest any hawk dove ongoing series has lasted fictional character biography edit hank and don hall edit hank and don hall in the hawk and the dove 1 september 1968 cover art by steve ditko hank and don hall were the sons of judge irwin hall they eventually found out that their father had many enemies when he was nearly assassinated hank and don eventually follow the criminal back to the hideout where they accidentally locked themselves in the closet of some criminals plotting to dispose of him just as hank and don who found for the first time they could agree that they wanted to save their father mysterious voices echoed throughout the room offering the boys a chance to save their father all they had to do was call upon the powers of the hawk and the dove the voices belonged to a lord of chaos named t charr and a lord of order named terataya even though the lords of chaos and order were eternal enemies these two lords had fallen in love 9 the hall brothers invoked their new powers and became hawk and dove the conservative hawk hank was hot headed and reactionary whereas the liberal dove don was more thoughtful and reasoned but was prone to indecisiveness judge irwin hall displayed a more balanced political beliefs and firmly disapproved of vigilantism not knowing his sons were costumed adventurers and the fact that hawk and dove had saved him from his would be assailants after their series ended hawk and dove became semi regulars in the teen titans eventually joining titans west writer alan brennert attempted to end their saga in a 1982 issue of the brave and the bold where 12 years later hank and don hall then adults are trying to cope with their 1960s values in the 1980s after hawk and dove teamed up with batman the mysterious voice revoked hank and don s powers deeming them still immature this was later intentionally disregarded with a joke where don notes everyone says they look older in new teen titans 50 when it was realized the real time aging of hank and don would affect the age of the teen titans as well dove died in 1985 s crisis on infinite earths while saving a young boy who was being attacked by the anti monitor s shadow demons the creature that killed dove came from behind while he was saving a kid from a falling building and hawk was too far away to intervene a statue of don is part of the memorial at titans tower in san francisco hawk continued on his own but without dove to restrain him he became violent to the point where many superheroes considered him nearly as much trouble as the supervillains modern age edit hawk and dove hank hall and dawn granger art by rob liefeld in 1988 a new hawk and dove miniseries written by karl kesel and barbara kesel reintroduced the duo 10 this series placed a woman named dawn granger as the dove replacing don who had died the new dove mysteriously received her powers while attempting to save her mother from terrorists at the end of the miniseries it was revealed that dawn received her powers the moment don had been stripped of them this dove while considerably more aggressive and self confident than don also has greater than average strength and dexterity faster than human speed and expanded mental capabilities dove fights mostly defensively preferring to out think and remain in control of her opponent she also heals quickly and cannot revert to dawn if her wounds or some other condition would be fatal to dawn they managed to hold their own against the lords of chaos creation called kestrel set in washington d c where the duo attended georgetown university the series introduced several supporting characters including hank s

black power rings in an interview with ign geoff johns provides an explanation behind dove s immunity to the black power rings you ll learn more about this as we go forward but really it speaks to the nature of don hall he can t be desecrated by the likes of these things he s untouchable in death and at total peace more than any other being in the universe reflecting on the limitations of the rings johns goes on to state that even though magic is a joke to the black power rings don is quite the opposite 38 hawk edit hawk possesses a danger sense transformation which allows him to change into a
