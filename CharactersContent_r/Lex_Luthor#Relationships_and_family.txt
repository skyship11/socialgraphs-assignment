originally appeared in action comics 23 cover dated april 1940 he has since endured as the archnemesis of the superhero superman 1 lex luthor was originally depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the 1960s to the early 1980s since the late 1980s he has more often been portrayed as the power mad ceo of lexcorp he wishes to rid the world of superman ostensibly because he views superman as a threat to humanity but in reality envies superman s popularity and influence 2 given his high profile as a supervillain however he has often come into conflict with batman and other superheroes in the dc universe 3 lex luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers but has above average intelligence a genius for inventions and a high command of science and technology he occasionally wears his warsuit a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength flight advanced weaponry and other capabilities while lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains in the likes of metallo parasite and bizarro and frequently leading dc supervillain teams such as the legion of doom he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with superman and other heroes when situation calls for it 4 the character was ranked 4th on ign s list of the top 100 comic book villains of all time 5 and as the 8th greatest villain by wizard on its 100 greatest villains of all time list 6 luthor is one of a few genre crossing villains whose adventures take place in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are

appearance action comics 23 april 1940 luthor is depicted as a diabolical genius and is referred to only by his surname he resides in a flying city suspended by a dirigible and plots to provoke a war between two european nations lois lane and clark kent investigate which results in lois being kidnapped luthor battles superman with a green ray but he is ultimately defeated and lois is rescued superman destroys luthor s dirigible with him still on it implying luthor may have died stories ending with luthor s apparent death become common in his earliest appearances with him turning up alive later on 7 luthor as he appears in superman 4 1940 luthor returns in superman 4 and steals a weapon from the u s army capable of causing earthquakes superman battles and defeats luthor then destroys the earthquake device the scientist who made the device commits suicide to prevent its reinvention in a story in the same issue luthor creates a city on the sunken lost continent of pacifo and populates it with recreated prehistoric monsters he plans to unleash upon the world superman thwarts his plans and luthor is seemingly killed by the dinosaurs he created luthor returns in superman 5 with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people so he can throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier moseley the story ends with superman defeating him in these early stories luthor s schemes are centered around financial gain or megalomaniacal ambitions unlike most later incarnations he demonstrates no strong animosity toward superman beyond inevitable resentment of the hero s constant interference with his plans luthor s obsessive hatred of superman came later in the character s development in luthor s earliest appearances he is shown as a middle aged man with a full head of red hair less than a year later however an artistic mistake resulted in luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip 8 the original error is attributed to leo nowak a studio artist who illustrated for the superman dailies during this period 9 one hypothesis is that nowak mistook luthor for the ultra humanite a recurring mad scientist foe of superman who in his golden age incarnation resembled a balding elderly man 9 other evidence suggests luthor s design was confused with that of a stockier bald henchman in superman 4 spring 1940 9 luthor s next appearance occurs in superman 10 may 1941 in which nowak depicted him as significantly heavier with visible jowls 9 the character s abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times over the course of his history in 1960 writer jerry siegel altered luthor s backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin during world war ii the war department asked for dailies of the superman comic strip to be pulled the strips in question were created in april 1945 and depicted lex luthor bombarding superman with the radiation from a cyclotron this violated wartime voluntary censorship guidelines meant to help conceal the manhattan project 10 11 luthor vanished for a long time coming back in superboy 59 september 1957 in a story called superboy meets amazing man a flying costumed bald man probably in his forties appears in smallville and starts helping people using his fantastic inventions he later moves his operations to the nearby town of hadley superboy finds he is using his inventions to set the town up so he can rob their bank and stops him in the last panel amazing man is in jail and he tells superboy he will regret it as sure as his name is luthor and superboy thinks that he will be superman by the time luthor gets out and that luthor s talents might make him an archenemy silver age lex luthor edit in 1956 dc comics reimagined the flash with a new secret identity costume and origin this led to the new silver age of comics and the first dc comics reboot with characters across the board being reimagined or having their histories and nature redefined the earlier golden age stories of superman and batman were later said to have taken place on earth two a parallel universe that was part of the larger dc multiverse the silver age version of luthor was introduced in adventure comics 271 april 1960 now given the first name lex later said to be short for alexis eventually retconned as alexander and an origin story originally hero worshiping superboy teenage lex luthor of smallville is determined to prove he is earth s greatest scientist by creating artificial life his recklessness and inexperience causes a fire in his lab and he calls on superboy to save him the boy of steel puts out the fire but in the process accidentally destroys the artificial life form and the years of research notes that led to its creation while fumes from the chemical fire cause luthor s hair to fall out unwilling to hold himself responsible for the lab fire and the destruction of his own life s work luthor decides that superboy was jealous of his intellect and caused the fire himself believing he s been betrayed by his hero and friend lex swears revenge 12 this revised origin makes luthor s fight with superman a personal one and suggests that if events had unfolded differently luthor might have grown to be a more noble person luthor s ego preventing him from personal growth and the tragedy that he and clark could have been a force for good together are played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s particularly in elliot s maggin s novels last son of krypton and miracle monday 13 the golden age version of luthor appears again as a villain still alive and well on earth two to distinguish him from the modern day lex luthor the original incarnation is shown as having kept his red hair and is retroactively given the first name alexei in dc comics presents annual 1 1982 alexei luthor of earth two and lex luthor of earth one team up it is shown that alexei is arguably colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of earth in order to prove his superiority whereas lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die 14 years later lex luthor and the villain brainiac recruit an army of super villains during crisis on infinite earths including alexei luthor from earth two when alexei argues that this army doesn t need two luthors brainiac agrees and executes him post crisis reboot edit cover of the man of steel 4 1986 art by john byrne following crisis on infinite earths 1985 1986 dc rebooted its universe yet again creating the post crisis reality in the 1986 limited series the man of steel john byrne redesigned lex luthor from scratch intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize an evil corporate executive byrne intentionally chose to base this new depiction of luthor on businessmen donald trump ted turner howard hughes and satan himself 15 initially brutish and overweight the character later evolved into a sleeker more athletic version of his old self luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire rather his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time marv wolfman a writer on action comics who had one conversation with byrne prior to luthor s reboot 16 recalled i never believed the original luthor every story would begin with him breaking out of prison finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere and then he d be defeated my view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn t need to rob banks i also thought later that luthor should not have super powers every other villain had super powers luthor s power was his mind he needed to be smarter than superman superman s powers had to be useless against him because they couldn t physically fight each other and superman was simply not as smart as luthor 17 as originally presented in the post crisis version of the dc comics universe lex luthor is a product of child abuse and early poverty born in the suicide slum district of metropolis he is instilled with a desire to become a self made man of great power and influence as a teenager he takes out a large life insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge then sabotages their car s brakes causing their deaths upon graduating from mit luthor founds his own business lexcorp which grows to dominate much of metropolis luthor does not fully appear in the man of steel mini series until the fourth issue which takes place over a year after superman s arrival in metropolis terrorists seize luthor s yacht forcing superman to intervene 18 satisfied at the hero s performance luthor attempts to hire him admitting he knew about the incoming attack and allowed it to occur so he could see how superman responded assuming that the man of steel would arrive in time enraged the mayor deputizes superman to arrest luthor for reckless endangerment although luthor is released from jail quickly and has the charges dropped the humiliation of being publicly arrested and processed coupled with indignation that superman refused to work for him results in the villain pledging to destroy superman simply to prove his power despite general acceptance of byrne s characterization which led to its influence in media adaptations dc comics writers began bringing back his quality of being a scientific genius in the 1990s in stories such as the final night by 2000 it was said that luthor s genuine accomplishments in several scientific fields is what helped create lexcorp and make it so successful so quickly in early post crisis stories byrne suggested that luthor was recognised as a brilliant inventor and great scientific mind but had largely withdrawn from his laboratory in favour of the boardroom regarding the character being a corrupt billionaire rather than a mad scientist author neil gaiman commented it s a pity lex luthor has become a multinationalist i liked him better as a bald scientist he was in prison but they couldn t put his mind in prison now he s just a skinny kingpin 19 luthor s romantic aspirations toward lois lane established early on in the series become a focal point of the stories immediately following it 20 he is shown making repeated attempts to court her during the man of steel though lois plainly does not return his feelings 21 in the superman adventures comic line based on the tv series of the same name luthor s backstory is identical to that of the post crisis origin with slight changes luthor is shown originating in suicide slum his intelligence outshining other children fueling his ambition to have all metropolis look up to him one day luthor s baldness is never explained save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood it is assumed the hair loss was natural luthor s parents die during his teenage years however their deaths are indeed accidental lex uses the insurance to pay for his tuition to mit and then founds lexcorp his hatred of superman is explained as the citizens of metropolis have admired the man of steel more than him modern depictions edit superman birthright a limited series written by mark waid in 2004 offers an alternate look at luthor s history including his youth in smallville and his first encounter with superman the story has similarities to the 2001 television series smallville 22 which follows clark kent s life as a teenager and into early adulthood one plot element shared by the comic and the show is the problematic relationship between lex and his father lionel along with this birthright restores the silver age concept of luthor befriending clark kent as a young man the two find a kinship in both feeling like outsider and sharing a wish to explore outer space and discover alien alife despite one resenting humanity and the other hoping to understand and be accepted by it lex discovers kryptonite samples in smallville and uses them as a power source for a machine he hopes will pierce space and time so he can communicate with krypton when clark falls ill approaching the machine lex mistakes his reaction as doubt in the young scientist s ability and sanity feeling betrayed lex continues the experiment but an explosion erupts the radiation blast causing his hair to fall out 23 24 luthor leaves metropolis and years later his scientific work largely based on his ideas about alien life results in a fortune he uses to create lexcorp when superman appears lex is angry at the powerful alien the kind of companion he d often hoped for looks on him with disapproval and openly disrespects him in front of the media for this and his interference with luthor s criminal operations the scientist businessman decides to humiliate and destroy the alien waid s original intention was to jettison the notion of lex luthor being an evil businessman restoring his status as a mad scientist he ultimately conceded however that the ceo luthor would be easier for readers to recognize in birthright luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate in contrast to byrne s characterization however lexcorp is founded upon luthor s study of extraterrestrial life thereby providing a link between him and superman 22 25 in the retrospective section of the superman birthright trade paperback waid explains despite my own personal prejudices i say we leave lex the criminal businessman he s been for the past 17 years the lois clark producers liked it the wb cartoon guys liked it so clearly it works on some level my concern is that at least in my eyes the fact that luthor s allowed to operate uncontested for years makes superman look ineffectual 26 birthright was initially intended to establish a new origin for superman and luthor 27 immediately the superman comics and the series superman batman made references to the canonicity of the new origin series but after infinite crisis ended in 2006 new stories discredited parts of it and it was officially replaced by the 2009 2010 series superman secret origin 28 superman secret origin revised lex s backstory so that he now again had a sister lena while he knew clark as a teenager in smallville he rejected the other boy s attempts to form a friendship resentful toward his alcoholic and abusive father lex arranges his parents to die in a car accident and uses the insurance money to leave smallville and start a better life after studying under the villains ra s al ghul and darkseid he founds lexcorp and uses his pr resources and media control to set himself up as a near savior in metropolis the daily planet opposes luthor and he retaliates in ways that leave the newspaper almost bankrupt superman s arrival challenges luthor s image and brings renewed interest to the planet when he does exclusive interviews with their staff clark kent jimmy olsen and lois lane work together to oppose luthor s power and superman tells the public they should strive to achieve great things themselves and not wait for others to be their saviors angry at superman s interference and blaming him for losing the love of the public luthor swears vengeance following changes to continuity in 2016 s dc rebirth the history from superman secret origin is still largely intact though it has also been revealed that for a time lionel luthor worked as a scientist for vandal savage and that this led to a brief friendship between lex and j onn j onzz the martian manhunter when both were children fictional character biography edit whether he is a mad scientist corrupt businessman or both luthor s ego is a defining trait in all his incarnations he believes he is entitled to both popularity and power while each incarnation initially wants the adoration of others and control over either smallville or metropolis the goal eventually rises to control over earth and possibly universal domination luthor s other defining trait is his obsession to destroy superman and humiliate the alien hero either by displaying his own superiority by achieving victory without the benefit of superpowers or to prove the man of steel is motivated by selfish desire rather than altruism many times luthor has claimed he could create a better way of life for the entire human race if not for superman s interference with his work he has even argued that the man of tomorrow s presence not only invites danger it actually encourages human society not to strive for greatness because a powerful alien is around to protect them and solve problems during the blackest night crossover wonder woman restrains luthor with her magic lasso and under its spell of truth he confesses he secretly wants to be superman revealing that beneath all his blustering luthor covets superman s powers for himself 29 when superman was out of sight for a year 30 luthor used the time to create the everyman project intending to create new superheroes to replace the kryptonian then later attacks metropolis with a long buried kryptonian warship returning to action superman points out that luthor had a year to prove his old argument that he could help others and improve earth if superman didn t interfere with his life but instead of curing disease or making technological breakthroughs all he did was focus on increasing his power and finding a big destructive machine so he could break things 31 in the storyline the black ring luthor is endowed with cosmic powers that could enable him to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe and therefore achieve his dream of being more respected than superman but he ultimately chooses to renounce his new powers when he realizes that his greatest enemy would never suffer again if he used them 32 at times lex has been shown evidence that clark kent is superman and almost always he denies this possibility unable to imagine a man of such power spending half his time pretending to be average since in his mind such a possibility would be too humiliating to bear in stories appearing in jla and 52 by grant morrison luthor cannot bring himself to believe superman is truly altruistic and deeply cares about a planet that is not his native world concluding the hero s good deeds are often actually passive aggressive ways of flaunting his power and popularity to lex when the hero joins forces with others to form a new powerful version of the justice league of america lex decides this is superman s direct challenge to his own power and establishes an injustice league composed of various supervillains to rival them 33 silver age edit while the golden age luthor later named alexei luthor is simply an amoral and brilliant man driven by a simple desire for power the silver age incarnation was given a more developed personality and backstory teenage lex luthor is an aspiring scientist who resides in smallville and greatly admires its local hero superboy after lex saves him from kryptonite the boy of steel builds him a private laboratory in gratitude after thousands of experiments the young scientist creates an artificial life form of primitive protoplasm overjoyed he accidentally causes a chemical fire in the lab superboy puts out the fire inadvertently spilling other chemicals destroying the artificial life form and the accumulated research notes that led to its creation the chemical fumes also cause lex s hair to completely fall out enraged he has lost years of research but unwilling to accept responsibility for the fire luthor concludes superboy intentionally sabotaged his work jealous of the young scientist s achievements and swears revenge 34 luthor creates grandiose engineering projects to prove his superiority over the superhero but each one fails and causes problems that superboy then solves luthor then makes his first attempt to murder the last son of krypton and fails instead of bringing him to the authorities superboy declares they are even now and expresses hope lex will straighten out and use his intelligence to help humanity rather than try to prove his superiority or waste time seeking power and vengeance 35 superman s girl friend lois lane 23 1961 reveals the silver age lex luthor parents are jules and arlene and that he has a younger sister lena when lex becomes a criminal the family moves away from smallville and changes its name to thorul an anagram to start a new life free of him lena thorul is a toddler at the time and grows up not remembering her real last name while her parents say her older brother died in a mountain climbing accident lex later watches over the adult lena making sure she does not discover her connection to one of earth s greatest villains as an adult lex luthor s driving ambitions are to kill superman and rule earth a stepping stone to dominating the universe believing a man of his intellect deserves such power 36 on several occasions he joins forces with superman s enemy brainiac though the two often betray each other as well lex is repeatedly imprisoned but his genius allows him to routinely escape he also makes it a point to be out of prison on the birthday of albert einstein regarding it as a holiday 24 a famous non canonical imaginary story from 1961 entitled the death of superman has luthor finally succeed in killing superman after pretending to reform and befriend him 37 38 on a distant arid planet orbiting a red star luthor challenges superman to a fight since kryptonians lose power when exposed to red sun radiation befriending the planet s inhabitants luthor aids them in rediscovering lost technology that restores the water supply and helps the society rebuild as a result luthor becomes a hero in the eyes of the planet whereas his enemy superman is detested as a villain the people rename the planet lexor and it becomes a regular home base and retreat for luthor in between his efforts to fight superman and take over earth 39 he later meets a local woman named ardora first called tharla but renamed ardora in later stories as well as the reprint of her first appearance the two eventually fall in love and marry 40 bronze age edit lex luthor in his lexorian warsuit from action comics 544 june 1983 art by george perez deciding to retire permanently luthor returns to lexor and learns he has fathered a son by ardora lex luthor jr he spends the next several weeks with his new family before discovering lexor suffers from the same planetary instability that destroyed krypton while creating a neutrarod tower to stabilize the planetary core luthor s pathological hatred for superman resurfaces and he reflects on feeling unsatisfied in life without their conflict the villain then unearths an ancient underground laboratory of great technology a relic from lexor s lost age after one of luthor s still active satellites threatens the people of earth he concludes superman will soon come to lexor to take him back to earth authorities with the underground lab s resources he spends weeks creating a highly destructive flight capable war suit later simply called a warsuit to finally match the kryptonian in physical combat and counter his powers to test the suit luthor performs several acts of destruction on lexor feigning ignorance when he hears about the mystery marauder and telling ardora he has no knowledge of the armored man when superman arrives luthor dons his warsuit and attacks now obsessed with the need to best the hero in combat and prove his superiority the people of lexor are shocked to realize he is the mystery marauder and does not care about the harm he has caused them during the battle luthor releases an energy salvo that accidentally overloads the neutrarod resulting in the complete destruction of the planet lexor and all its inhabitants including ardora and lex jr similar to how he reacted after the destruction of his lab in smallville lex is unable to process his grief and accept his responsibility for lexor s destruction he psychologically blocks part of his own memory to convince himself superman is at fault renewing his need for vengeance in his subsequent stories he regularly uses the lexorian warsuit 41 the warsuit was designed by george pérez 42 as part of the super powers toyline in the early 1980s before being introduced into the comics in 1983 43 the suit vanished in 1986 after crisis on infinite earths rebooted dc comics continuity but was reintroduced in 2004 now said to be built with a combination of earth and alien technology including tech from the other dimensional world apokolips and armed with different forms of kryptonite in the gauntlet 44 lex luthor of earth one team up with alexei luthor of earth two it is shown that alexei is arguable colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of earth in order to prove his superiority whereas lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die they even extend their alliance to ultraman when earth three s lex luthor is a good guy all three villains were defeated by superman of earth one superman of earth two and lex luthor of earth three 14 during the 12 issue limited series crisis on infinite earths

brainiac kills alexei in response at the conclusion of the series reality is altered so that each of the different universes converge into one luthor is subsequently returned to prison with all his memories of the crisis forgotten this incarnation of lex luthor met his end in the non canonical two part story whatever happened to the man of tomorrow that closed out the pre crisis superman continuity of the silver and bronze age luthor finds brainiac s robotic head hoping to revive the villain for a new team up instead brainiac takes control of luthor s body forcing him to be a host as he attempts to destroy superman luthor later begs a superpowered lana lang to kill him who does so brainiac retains control of the body for a short period of time before rigor mortis sets in then abandons it running out of power shortly afterward post crisis edit as part of the continuity changes which followed the man of steel and superman secret origin alexander lex joseph luthor is corrupt

luthor becomes obsessed with superman and gathers all information on him and his associates leading a computer analysis to conclude clark kent and superman are the same person unable to believe someone as powerful as superman regularly hide that power and pretend to be average as that is something he would never do himself luthor dismisses the computer s findings and concludes both the machine and its programmer are at fault 45 as a nod to the previous continuity luthor has his lab create high tech armor that resembles the lexorian warsuit rather than act directly he has an employee don the armor and attack superman for him the man is defeated and cannot testify against luthor because the armor s neural control unit destroys his mind along with this luthor participates in the

superboy he is reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps where he is amongst its members that try to attack lex luthor after the events of blackest night luthor went on to build a gynoid version of lois lane using brainiac technology his primary purpose for creating her was to have a companion who would voice honest opinions and provide an extra voice of reason to counsel him on his obsessive quest for the black lantern energy luthor also had a pseudo romantic relationship with the loisbot and regularly slept with it 121 powers and abilities edit lex luthor has the physical capabilities of a normal adult human with no metahuman abilities however for virtually his entire publication history he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the dc universe and one of the most intelligent beings of any planet he possesses an eidetic memory and has mastered seemingly every known form of science including space travel extra dimensional travel biochemistry robotics computers synthetic polymers communications mutations transportation holography energy generation spectral analysis and time travel with the exception of the extraterrestrial entity known as brainiac and occasionally batman luthor does not view any other being as an intellectual peer his exceptional intellectual gifts act as his superpowers allowing him to craft advanced weapons and equipment outthink opponents much stronger and more powerful than himself and manipulate others into doing his bidding his genius also extends to business he is one of the world s wealthiest people and politics he was elected u s president and he is often the leader of super villain groups he has belonged to luthor has been trained in hand to hand combat specifically karate 122 he has also been occasionally trained by the amazons of themyscira weaponry edit over the years luthor has created either on his own using alien technology he acquires or with the resources of lexcorp and the military many highly advanced weapons machines and robots to carry out his plans or destroy his enemies he has made liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of injuring superman and other kryptonians and he has often created synthetic kryptonite not as lethal as real green kryptonite but still capable of weakening a kryptonian since the bronze age he has also utilized various high tech war suits in many stories the first warsuit introduced in 1983 was a product of lost science from an earlier age in the planet lexor s history when technology was highly advanced its lexorian materials can withstand several attacks by superman before sustaining damage and its force field offers further protection still wearing it grants lex great superhuman strength not equal to superman but still enough to overpower many of earth s heroes the suit can deliver powerful energy blasts and a molecular sheath capable of blocking superman s body from absorbing energy from solar radiation meaning his powers will weaken over time powered by red solar radiation the suit can also deliver red solar beams to directly weaken superman the suit has other features including advanced sensor systems a hypnotism weapon and illusion casting technology the warsuit introduced in 2004 is built with technology from apokolips granting greater superhuman strength and resistance to injury a powerful force field flight electrical weapons and a variety of kryptonite based weaponry such as energy cannons axes and a collapsible sword its power is great enough that luthor could fly for several days without interruption the gauntlets hold different forms of kryptonite stones after reality is altered by flashpoint luthor uses a new warsuit similar to the 2004 one but slimmer and built by reverse engineering kryptonian technology when he temporarily attempts to act as a hero and works alongside the justice league luthor uses a similar warsuit with non lethal weaponry and no kryptonite based features luthor often wore a kryptonite ring on his right hand in post crisis stories but abandoned this tactic after prolonged exposure to its radiation resulted in cancer requiring him to transplant his brain into a cloned body to survive while masquerading as his own son lex luthor ii lex occasionally wore high tech lx 20 body armor during the blackest night crossover he wore an orange power ring of avarice created by ganthet a former member of the guardians of the universe alternate versions edit dc comics often depicts its stories as taking place in a wide multiverse with many parallel realities where familiar characters have slightly or drastically different lives likewise there are some comics published under the elseworlds label meaning it is a story that is outside of canon and does not necessarily have a specific universe designation such as earth 3 or earth x the point of elseworlds stories is to reimagine familiar characters in new settings while many versions of luthor are similar to the mainstream one simply existing in different settings some significant famous and or recurring alternate versions of the character include earth three edit earth three was introduced during the silver age of comics as a mirror version of the dc comics earth where americans colonized europe and actor abraham lincoln shot president john wilkes booth an evil version of the justice league known as the crime syndicate of america terrorizes this world eventually a heroic scientist named alexander luthor opposes them donning a high tech red yellow and blue supersuit during his initial adventure he is aided by the supermen of earth two and earth two as well as earth 3 s noble reporter lois lane at the time when ultraman collaborated with lex luthor of earth one and alexei luthor of earth two 14 later alex and lois marry and have a child alexander luthor jr who aids earth s heroes during the crisis on infinite earths and then opposes them in the crossover infinite crisis 123 earth 3 edit the new 52 timeline introduced its own version of earth 3 in the crossover forever evil 2014 the alexander luthor of this earth 3 is his world s version of shazam 124 called mazahs he takes the superpowers of those he kills and is the father of superwoman s child he is later killed by the new 52 version of lex luthor 91 following the reboot of the multiverse at the end of dark nights death metal as seen during the infinite frontier earth 3 is recreated with a new version of alexander luthor this version is a non superpowered african american man who wears a suit of high tech armour he is the sworn enemy of ultraman the self appointed ruler and protector of metropolis and one of the few people with the courage to defy him directly he is depicted as well intentioned and compassionate but largely ineffectual he is horrified when earth 3 s evil metahumans are hailed as heroes for defeating the invading starros aided by former emerald knight thaal sinestro and a new god named lonar he begins recruiting good metahumans into a legion of justice most of the group is defeated and luthor is imprisoned by ultraman 125 anti matter earth edit the anti matter universe is a dark often opposite reflection of the mainstream dc universe that is similar to earth three armed with a green and purple high tech warsuit the alexander luthor of this reality

decides to call earth 2 in hopes that the justice league can save his world the team tries but realize that they cannot win for long on the anti matter earth because evil holds sway in this universe metaphysically because lucifer defeated archangel michael and thus wins more often meaning heroes are fated to ultimately fail or die this idea presented in the graphic novel jla earth 2 was a meta commentary by writer grant morrison on the fact that in the main dc universe it is accepted by readers that good tends to triumph over evil 126 batman the dark knight strikes again edit in batman the dark knight strikes again set in a world where heroes have been publicly retired for years lex luthor is depicted as obese with a hunchback he has teamed up with brainiac and controls the u s

hostage when batman and catgirl emerge from hiding they take on luthor and batman slashes a z into luthor s face before leaving in retaliation he orders superman and wonderman to kill an alien which is really brainiac hoping superman would get killed that plan however failed when his daughter lara saved him then luthor launched satellites to destroy most of the world s population but they were destroyed by the green lantern lex luthor is eventually killed by the son of hawkman and hawkgirl 127 bizarro luthor edit in multiple versions of dc comics canon superman s imperfect duplicate bizarro

mercy an alien plant that feeds off an organism s psychic energy while distracting them with an illusion of the life they want through repeated use lex experiences multiple scenarios where he acquires the great power and or superpowers he always wanted but finds he is never satisfied realizing his ambitions are based on ego while superman regularly considers how his actions will affect or benefit others this luthor spends the rest of his life creating new ways for people to heal and live better lives amalgam comics edit during the crossover dc vs marvel the realities of dc comics and marvel comics temporarily merged resulting in the amalgam comics universe in this reality lex luthor s person and history merged with that of the red skull creating the green skull a war profiteer during world war ii this lex luthor later injects himself with a chemical agent derived from a radioactive green meteorite extending his lifespan while giving him green skin and his head a skull like appearance in multiple amalgam comics stories he opposes super soldier a combination of superman and captain america earth c minus edit there is a version of lex luthor who is a villainous lemur that
