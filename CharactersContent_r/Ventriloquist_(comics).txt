continuity and in this new timeline the third and final incarnation of the character was introduced shauna belzer first appearing in batgirl 20 july 2013 as created by gail simone and fernando pasarin 3 fictional character biography edit arnold wesker edit a meek quiet man named arnold wesker the first ventriloquist plans and executes his crimes through a dummy named scarface with the dress and persona of a 1920s gangster complete with pinstripe suit cigar and tommy gun his name comes from the nickname of al capone after whom scarface is modeled 4 born into a powerful organized crime family wesker develops dissociative identity disorder after seeing his mother assassinated by thugs from a rival family growing up his only outlet is ventriloquism showcase 94 8 9 establishes an alternate origin story after a barroom brawl in which he kills someone during a violent release of his repressed anger wesker is sent to blackgate penitentiary he is introduced to woody a dummy carved from the remains of the former blackgate gallows by his cellmate donnegan who convinces him to escape and kill donnegan in a fight which scars the dummy thus resulting in the birth of scarface wesker lets the scarface personality do the dirty work including robbery and murder he is totally dominated by scarface who barks orders at him and degrades him with verbal and even physical abuse wesker is unable to enunciate the letter b in his words while throwing his voice and replaces them with the letter g instead for example scarface often calls batman and robin gatman and rogin in the 1995 riddler story riddler the riddle factory it is revealed that a gangster named scarface scarelli had once been active in gotham city though he had apparently died long before batman s era a supernatural aspect to scarface was hinted at in wesker s alternate origin story in showcase 94 8 9 when wesker s cellmate creates the first scarface dummy from pieces of wood from the remains of blackgate prison s gallows batman scarface a psychodrama 2001 reinforces this and shows the dummy to be indirectly responsible for two accidents while separated from wesker with at least one fatality the dummy also retained his speech impediment while operated by a young boy and seemed to even show awareness of his name during this period the ventriloquist is one of many villains in the batman s rogues gallery to be confined to arkham asylum when batman apprehends him one particularly memorable series of events concerning him took place during the knightfall storyline after bane had destroyed arkham and released its inmates 5 unable to find scarface the ventriloquist uses a sock puppet in his place for a short time aptly named socko after an ill fated team up with fellow escapee amygdala 6 he procures a number of other hand puppets to fill in for scarface including one of a police officer which he refers to as chief o hara later when wesker does indeed find scarface scarface and socko are set at odds until a standoff occurs and the dummy and the puppet both shoot each other leaving wesker unconscious and bleeding from two wounded hands 7 during the events of the cataclysm story arc the stress caused by the earthquake apparently triggered the release of another personality within wesker in the form of the quakemaster who claimed to have caused the earthquake himself over a video and threatened to trigger another unless he was paid 100 million however the seismologist quakemaster had captured to provide him with information deliberately feeds him inaccurate scientific data to provide detectives looking for her with information as to her location robin subsequently deduces quakemaster s true identity due to his speeches always taking great effort to avoid saying any words with the letter b in one issue wesker is apparently killed and in a bizarre twist scarface appears to still talk and act alive before he is destroyed this death appears to have been retconned in one year later presumably due to the events of the infinite crisis crossover event wesker appears as one of the members of the secret society of super villains that faces the jade canary who pitches scarface off the top of a roof the death of the first ventriloquist arnold wesker art by don kramer in detective comics 818 an issue later included in the trade paperback batman face the face wesker is murdered by an unseen

ring and is reanimated into a black lantern using his power ring wesker creates a construct of scarface made of black energy he is shown murdering many police officers 9 in september 2011 the new 52

afterwards he is put in charge of coney island s mafia peyton riley edit the second ventriloquist peyton riley interior art of detective comics 827 march 2007 art by don kramer a new female ventriloquist peyton riley called sugar by scarface soon surfaced in the pages of detective comics batman responded to a police scanner call witnesses said catwoman had been shot he got to the body

too exploded batman had the police exhume arnold wesker s body but the coffin was empty bruce uses one of his disguises small timer lefty knox to see what the underground was saying within a week he

confessing a batarang flew and took out the lights causing scarface to open fire batman swooped in and grabbed the woman and the dummy he separated them and realized the dummy was a bomb forcing him to dispose of it and allowing the woman to escape batman then informed gordon of what had happened sugar is a more compatible partner than wesker since scarface no longer substitutes b with g and she is far more willing to commit violent crime when nearly captured by batman and harley quinn who had been close to wesker after he tried to cheer her up when she was initially sent to arkham while the joker was still on the loose sugar has scarface say save yourself unlike wesker who is horrified at any damage to scarface sugar rigs her dummies to explode using this to cover her escapes she has

gotham s irish and italian gangs atkins is beaten severely leaving him in intensive care sean s alcoholism gets worse and peyton was forced to marry sabatino this does not lead to the hoped for gang alliance as sabatino proves to be an inept gangster he and peyton are eventually taken to see scarface as sabatino had cheated him on a weapons deal both scarface and wesker were impressed by peyton s intelligence and gave sabatino a second chance taking 30 of his profits 13 in detective comics 850 november 2008 she and tommy elliot bond over their mutual resentment of their families and vow that

thug named moose hits her with an oar while batman protects zatanna from moose peyton makes another attempt to throw sabatino over the side but gets too close and he begins to strangle her with the rope around his wrists scarface quietly says jump sugar and peyton sends them both over the side before they hit the water scarface says g bye kiddo i loved y riley has not appeared again ever since

side effect of his mental illness he possesses some degree of telepathic immunity when the supervillain psycho pirate attempted to use his emotion manipulating powers to instill wesker with fear wesker responded by punching psycho pirate as scarface quipped no one controls the ventriloquist no one but me 16 he is a skilled ventriloquist and his scarface persona is a skilled criminal strategist however he is unable to pronounce any word with a letter b in it accurately without moving his lips giving scarface a speech impediment in which he says every b in a word as a g wesker usually carries a handgun of some kind while scarface carries a trademark tommy gun however wesker tends to show that he and scarface hold two different personalities and he and scarface can sometimes argue amongst each other which tends to work as an advantage to batman on several occasions citation needed the second ventriloquist is much more skilled in ventriloquism than her predecessor and is capable of pronouncing all speech patterns with more proficiency when in her scarface persona unlike the first one the second ventriloquist s personality does not contradict scarface s and is much

overdose of pills by batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from clayface s body this was done so that napier who was using the mad
