history edit creation edit like many of his golden age and silver age comic book counterparts the creation of blackhawk has been the subject of sometimes contentious debate will eisner has at times been considered the characters primary creator with eisner himself acknowledging the contributions of chuck cuidera and writer bob powell 5 over the years cuidera became increasingly vocal that he did much more work on blackhawk than eisner and that he had in fact already started creating the characters prior to joining eisner s studio 6 according to cuidera he and powell fleshed out the concept deciding on everything from names and nationalities to the characters distinguishing traits uniforms and the aircraft they would fly 7 in 1999 eisner addressed his view of the matter during a comic con panel it s not important who created it it s the guy who kept it going and made something out if it that s more important whether or not chuck cuidera created or thought of blackhawk to begin with is unimportant the fact that chuck cuidera made blackhawk what it was is the important thing and therefore he should get the credit 8 the quality comics years edit military comics 18 april 1943 art by reed crandall the blackhawks debuted in august 1941 as the lead feature in the first issue of quality comics anthology series military comics billed as featuring stories of the army and navy viewed by will eisner as a modern version of the robin hood legend 7 the team s first appearance was co written by chuck cuidera and bob powell with art by cuidera 1 although the exact nature of eisner cuidera and powell s individual contributions to the creation of the blackhawks will never be known it is confirmed that each performed some level of writing duties at different times during the first eleven issues with eisner working on early covers with cuidera and cuidera providing interior artwork 1 7 when cuidera joined the armed services in 1942 reed crandall took over as artist beginning a long association with the characters that would last until 1953 9 jim steranko has observed where cuidera made blackhawk a best seller crandall turned it into a classic a work of major importance and lasting value 7 it was during crandall s run that the series hit its sales and popularity zenith the blackhawks success earned them their own title in winter 1944 that issue blackhawk 9 picked up the numbering of quality s canceled uncle sam quarterly they meanwhile continued to be featured prominently in military comics later renamed modern comics until that book s cancellation with 102 october 1950 during the quality years a whole host of well respected talent worked on the character including writers manly wade wellman bill woolfolk bill finger and dick french 10 as well as artists al bryant bill ward and dick dillin it was french also an accomplished songwriter who infused the team with the quirky desire to sing celebratory songs from their cockpits as they swooped in and out of battle 11 quality comics ceased operations with comics cover dated december 1956 with blackhawk 107 being the final issue published by quality the character and title trademarks were initially leased on a royalty basis to national periodical publications now dc comics before eventually being sold in their entirety 11 acquired by dc comics edit blackhawk was one of the few quality series that dc chose to keep running uninterrupted penciller dick dillin and inker chuck cuidera remained on the title ensuring a near seamless transition the duo would stay with the title through nearly its entire first run at dc steering deeper and deeper into the realm of science fiction the blackhawks found themselves confronting a steady stream of unmemorable and mostly one off supervillain like adversaries bent on world domination the blackhawks also gained a new ally in blackhawk 133 february 1959 lady blackhawk a pilot named zinda blake who was determined to become the first female member of the team after a couple of appearances she was granted honorary status and became a semi frequent member of the supporting cast in an effort to update the characters dc gave the team its first ever major wardrobe overhaul in blackhawk 197 june 1964 replacing their longtime uniforms with red and black shirts and green pants on a dramatic level lady blackhawk was transformed into a supervillain queen killer shark in blackhawk 200 september 1964 then in a much more drastic attempt to combat flagging sales due to the rising popularity of superhero books and the batman tv series dc proclaimed with blackhawk 228 january 1967 the beginning of the new blackhawk era with a cover featuring justice league of america members superman batman green lantern and the flash observing that the blackhawks are in superman s words washed up and in batman s words junk heap heroes in the issues that followed all but blackhawk gained a costumed superhero alter ego at the behest of a shadowy government agency with sales continuing to sink the blackhawks were restored to something that more closely resembled their original roots in blackhawk 242 august 1968 losing the superhero identities in favor of their traditional blue and black uniforms it was too late though the comic was canceled for the first time one issue later 1970s edit just over seven years later dc comics resurrected the series with blackhawk 244 january 1976 as part of an ongoing mid 1970s expansion of the line dubbed conway s corner in house ads the blackhawks were transplanted to the 1970s and now portrayed as mercenaries for hire matching wits against fancifully bizarre new villains as well as a re imagined killer shark and war wheel this run ended with blackhawk 250 january 1977 1980s 1990s edit amid rampant rumors that steven spielberg was interested in blackhawk as a possible film project dc comics once again resumed the series initially conceived as being published quarterly editor len wein convinced dc to make the book monthly and eventually assembled a team that included writer mark evanier and artist dan spiegle 12 blackhawk 251 october 1982 returned the team to a world war ii setting and restored many of the familiar trappings that had been shed over the years during the various attempts to modernize the characters numerous new supporting characters were introduced during the run most notably domino a buxom nazi assassin and love interest to blackhawk who was reminiscent of the femme fatales so common during the quality comics era evanier also reintroduced arch villain killer shark and has said he would have likely added lady blackhawk to the cast had the series lasted longer 12 but faced with stagnant sales that evanier attributed largely to dc s lack of interest in publicizing the series 12 the book was canceled with blackhawk 273 november 1984 though it wouldn t be known at the time that issue would mark the definitive end of the series original issue numbering sometime after the cancellation dc employed writer bill dubay and artist carmine infantino to produce a blackhawk mini series though never published numerous finished pages exist 13 in 1988 a three issue mini series by howard chaykin re imagined the team during world war ii yet again this time with a notably more adult and gritty take on the characters chaykin for the most part eschewed the team dynamic so familiar to blackhawk readers instead crafting a politically charged espionage thriller that focused prominently on blackhawk and a new version of lady blackhawk post war stories respecting chaykin s continuity followed in action comics weekly 601 608 615 622 and 628 635 as well as in a monthly series that restarted with an issue 1 and ran 16 issues from march 1989 to august 1990 14 in 1992 dc comics published blackhawk special 1 still respecting chaykin s continuity and set 10 years after the events of blackhawk 16 the story spans a five year period as blackhawk seeks to avenge the death of team member andré more recent appearances edit since 1992 mostly modern hints of the team have appeared usually in the form of the blackhawk express courier service or the time displaced lady blackhawk one of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of team member chop chop in a few issues of dc s hawkworld series other blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as our worlds at war and kingdom come it is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration if any those groups have to the classic blackhawks blackhawk at

archive editions series blackhawk made an appearance in the brave and the bold vol 3 9 february 2008 teaming up with the boy commandos during a world war ii tale the blackhawks appeared in superman

from the characters debut in 1941 to the end of their first run in 1968 at one point or another every member of the team except blackhawk is depicted in ways stereotypical for the time and over the course of the series several would develop their own catchphrases blackhawk first polish then american the man known as blackhawk is portrayed as a strong decisive leader he s not always easy on his men calling olaf a big fat head for example 24 but always appears to command their unquestionable respect at one point late in the first series run he s given a name bart hawk 25 stanislaus blackhawk

a member he exhibits surprising aggression toward his teammates 33 with hendrickson left ailing in the final issue of the run and chuck seemingly killed in battle it s possible that big changes were in store for the team s line up had the series continued past blackhawk 250 two possible replacements are set up either of whom could have also taken the mantle of lady blackhawk duchess ramona fatale also referred to as patch a mercenary with questionable allegiances but harboring love for blackhawk and elsa hendrickson s daughter 1982 1984 edit with the team s return to a world war ii setting

operations lady blackhawk kunoichi japanese field operative the irishman ukrainian field operative attila hungarian field operative canada wildman field support operative evolution of chop chop edit the longtime depiction of chop chop with art by reed crandall the version portrayed here in 1943 played on racist stereotypes against east asians particularly during world war ii 35 throughout the 1940s and well into the 1950s chop chop provides comic relief in the blackhawk strip and is depicted as more of a highly exaggerative caricature amid the realistic art style that otherwise surrounds him fat buck toothed and orange skinned he speaks in broken english wears a queue hairstyle complete with a bow and dresses in colorful coolie garb this depiction although now considered offensive was not atypical of world war ii era depictions of asians especially the japanese 36 a popular character at the time chop chop also appears in his own humor feature in the blackhawk series from 1946 to 1955 even in his very earliest appearances he demonstrates tremendous competency and bravery arriving on blackhawk island in a plane of his own construction 37 and then relatively soon after is shown fighting right alongside blackhawk in a hand to hand melee 24 despite this he s long portrayed as essentially blackhawk s sidekick riding along in blackhawk s plane as opposed to piloting his own and often brandishing a cleaver in battle in 1952 it s firmly stated that he s a full member of the team 19 and from 1955 to 1964 he slowly transforms into a more realistically drawn character changes that culminate when the blackhawks take on a major uniform change for the first time in their history and chop chop finally joins them in his choice of wardrobe 38 when the team later reverts to their traditional blue and black uniforms he dons one for the first time 25 when the 1980s world war ii set revival of the series begins chop chop is again shown in a variation of his original outfit and even clutches a cleaver on the cover of the first issue 39 it s quickly apparent however that the similarities end there and that he s far from comic relief as the run progresses it s revealed that he feels slighted by his teammates not given proper enough respect to even wear the same uniform as them realizing their embarrassing oversight they bestow to him with great ceremony a standard uniform and his own plane to mark him as a respected member of the group 40 after dc comics company wide crossover event crisis on infinite earths revamped and streamlined many of dc s properties chop chop has almost exclusively been depicted with a build similar to his comrades and wearing the blackhawks standard uniform his past likeness and role as sidekick is addressed shown as a character in a comic book about the blackhawks which he finds infuriatingly insulting 41 chop chop is given a proper name and uniform art by dan spiegle 40 1983 controversy edit in blackhawk 263 october 1983 writer mark evanier took over the blackhawk bylines letter column to address an anonymous editorial written by a staff member of the richmond times dispatch that ran in the paper s february 6 1983 edition evanier wrote of the piece he let s assume it s a he complains no longer does the oriental blackhawk bang no goodniks on the head with manhole covers exclaiming chop chop fixee so face look difflunt the writer loves this kind of stuff and then goes on to explain that to not depict chop chop in this manner is the real insult he writes since chop chop turned up full grown in 1941 he might well have been born into a village in which the customs of imperial china still lingered referring to the fact that chop chop no longer sports the ponytail dequeueing him demonstrates not tolerance but cultural imperialism to the extent that a working class chinese spoke english it would be pidgin not the queen s translation the fat stupid version was historically accurate 42 an admittedly stunned evanier
