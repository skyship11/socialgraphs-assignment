the creature commandos came about writer j m dematteis recalled i was doing war tales sic for about six months before the dc implosion put me out of work for almost a year and the last idea i had i took a look at the title weird war and i said ya gotta have a lot of monsters then after i was getting work there again was when they were trying to revivify the mystery books by putting series in them so i went to len wein editor with the creature commandos the actual title may have been len s i think it was and he said the same thing that s so silly that it will work let s do it and we did it and it was silly and nothing came of it and the book died anyway 4 dematteis didn t stay on the feature very long and his replacement was robert kanigher who wrote the series until weird war tales was canceled in 1983 fictional team history edit project m edit project m is a secret government organization that began during world war ii and specializes in experimental biotechnology and necromancy known creations of the project beside the creature commandos include miss america and the g i robot the project s main scientist is professor mazursky he was aided by robert crane as told in young all stars 12 they operated from a secret underground complex on the mythical ferris island in new york 1 panel from weird war tales 119 january 1983 art by jim craig in 1942 project m created the creature commandos they were lt matthew shrieve a normal human warren griffith a werewolf sgt vincent velcro a vampire pvt elliot lucky taylor a frankensteinian monster and dr myrna rhodes a gorgon project m yielded other interesting specimens most notably they were behind the creation of the heroine miss america prof mazursky kidnapped her after his original subject perished at first his experiments appeared to have left her incapacitated he later returned her unconscious form to the surface world after that she began a career as a masked heroine but was critically injured while fighting alongside the freedom fighters project m recovered her and nursed her back to health while there project m was visited by the young all stars who had discovered that project m had been infiltrated a criminal named deathbolt was there seeking a new physical host for the disembodied brain of the ultra humanite the ultra humanite took over the body of a dinosaur recovered from dinosaur island during the same visit the young all stars witnessed the unfinished body of the machine that would later be known as the g i robot 5 world war ii edit the team s first mission was in france where they destroyed nazi manufactured android duplicates of the allied leaders in their next mission to france to free scientist dr renee frederique the commandos ultimately found her in a death camp and they had no choice but to kill her her knowledge of a chemical nerve gas was too risky to be left in nazi hands because of his part in the killing taylor attempted suicide although the doctors attempted to repair him he remained mute for the rest of the series on another morally dubious mission the team caused the deaths of dozens of super soldier children in 1943 the commandos were deployed to dinosaur island in the south pacific they were supposed to solve the disappearance of several allied spotter planes but discovered a hidden axis naval base and were able to trick the dinosaurs in turning on the japanese navy shrieve took pictures for his commanders as proof of the island s existence but velcro destroyed them he believed that the war would bring destruction to the dinosaurs when they returned to dinosaur island they met j a k e 1 the g i robot he met the commandos when their plane was attacked by a dinosaur and crashed into the beach together the soldiers discovered an underwater civilization a supposed lost colony of atlantis situated in the pacific the lost colony had created a group of robots to carry on the work of atlantean conquest and these androids took control of the g i robot s mind j a k e 1 ultimately overrode their commands and sacrificed itself to destroy the colony at the end of the war the creature commandos and j a k e 2 and its robot dog and robot cat were forced to man a rocket aimed at berlin but the rocket went radically off course and headed out of the atmosphere into deep space 6 much later they with j a k e 2 as of action comics 872 appeared as captives in brainiac s ship 5 7 modern era edit cover of creature commandos 1 may 2000 art by scott eaton and ray kryssing the original team with j a k e 2 is freed from the confines of brainiac s

that freed them an attack by the villains reactron and metallo 8 the american military conspiracy that has attacked the kandorians sweep up the commandos though they are not quite sure of the value of the group 9 somehow the original team later returned to earth and to project m where they continued to serve as a special operations force to keep pace with their aging physiology mazursky the doctor who had originally mutated them continued to perform a series of body modifications this process extended their lives but at the cost of their humanity at an unspecified date in the near future the various original team members adopted code names project m continued to grow in size and the original team came to form the core field team codenamed m team alpha m team alpha was sporadically infused
