in order to get gearhead off of batman with his legs removed finch still managed to get away with a batarang still in his cybernetic arm while enlisting the help of robin batman traced gearhead to the sewers where he found a batarang and no gearhead just then gearhead attacked batman while chasing gearhead batman figured out that his attack on gloria was a cover so that he can have revenge on
