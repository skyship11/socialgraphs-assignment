wears a clock mask a cape and a blue suit with clock drawings on it 2 clock king is a master planner and sometimes uses clock themed gadgetry the clock king became better known more recently by his appearances in justice league international and suicide squad fictional character biography edit william tockman edit born william tockman the clock king spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister during one day he finds out from a doctor s visit that he himself only has six months to live despairing for his sister s future he watches the timing of a local bank s vault in order to rob it hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone his caper would have gone successfully had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by green arrow 3 while he is incarcerated his sister dies alone in further and hideous irony tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient infuriated he escapes later futilely attempting revenge on both green arrow and the incompetent doctor 4 with several other villains the clock king becomes a member of the injustice league a team of out of luck supervillains who when banding together become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers 5 the injustice league is defeated time and again by the justice league

cameron chase an unclear super effect from chase ultimately neutralizes clock king s team and they are all imprisoned clock king himself escapes on another bus 9 still later clock king and his injustice league friends are transformed into the new suicide squad they are sent to a remote research facility where a genetic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage its main defenses are spawned
