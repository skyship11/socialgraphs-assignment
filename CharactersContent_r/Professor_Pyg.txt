pyg is an obsessive perfectionist who sees human beings as broken individuals he commonly kidnaps people and uses surgery and chemicals to permanently change them into mind controlled automatons known as dollotrons and sometimes into human animal hybrids morrison took the name professor pyg from the song pygmalism by momus and kahimi karie the name pyg is also shorthand for pygmalion referring to both the mythical sculptor who fell in love with his own creation and the 1913 stage play both of which serve as parallels for lazlo valentin and his love for his dollotron creations the character s origin story alludes to real life animal testing carried out in the mid twentieth century he has a makeshift mother made of nails and boards from which he associates auditory hallucinations commanding him to constantly improve his surgical work pyg began making substantial appearances in other media in 2013 with the animated series beware the batman and has since appeared in video games television

story batman in bethlehem by morrison and artist andy kubert published in batman 666 by dc comics the story is set in a future in which bruce wayne s son damian helms the batman vigilante persona although morrison had developed a detailed backstory for pyg they were unsure the character would be used again 3 the name professor pyg originates from the song pygmalism written by momus for kahimi

batman reborn focuses on dick grayson who takes over the batman mantle after bruce wayne is pronounced dead and partners with a younger damian wayne who is now robin 5 in the story lazlo valentin was

diversion to escape blackgate penitentiary 11 the following issue focuses on professor pyg s business relationship with doctor hurt who says he has challenged pyg to outline his personal vision for gotham as the virus spreads across the city riots occur under hurt s command 12 the story concludes with bruce wayne returning to stop doctor hurt after being trapped in the timestream the infected civilians are quarantined and professor pyg is captured and transferred to arkham asylum 13 the character s backstory including his origin is significantly expanded upon in batman incorporated

effects of alzheimer s disease lazlo develops paranoid schizophrenia leading to drug abuse and self inflicted surgeries that turn him into professor pyg lazlo fathered a son named janosz valentin who serves the criminal organization leviathan and claimed his father taught him to be immune to pain 14 the new 52 edit in september 2011 dc comics rebooted their line of comic books under the new 52 banner establishing a new continuity while keeping landmark stories intact 15 this iteration of professor pyg still lazlo valentin was introduced in batman 1 september 2011 among other established batman villains during an escape riot at arkham asylum which was thwarted by batman wayne and nightwing grayson 16 he continued to make cameo appearances as an arkham asylum inmate in later comics 17 18 19 in the storyline forever evil the inmates of arkham asylum and blackgate penitentiary battle for control of gotham pyg and his dollotrons briefly gain control over a district of the city but are usurped by bane 20 he is later forced by scarecrow to ingest the steroid venom to combat the usurper 21 in october 2013 a prequel to batman in bethlehem titled damian son of batman in which an older damian wayne succeeds his father as batman was written by andy kubert under the new 52 imprint 22 having plotted the mini series in 2008 kubert wanted to return to that timeline saying i had always wanted to write in talking with editor mike marts he suggested i come up with a mini series i would like to write and draw i really loved that batman and the whole world that grant morrison dreamed up so i thought it would be fun to do a story of how damian actually becomes that 666 batman 23 an aging pyg appears in the second issue and his henchmen in the third batman damian attempts to stop him from experimenting on kidnapped children but pyg s dollotrons expel batman from the area pyg is never caught 24 25 the character plays a larger role in the first volume of the weekly series batman eternal which ran from april to august 2014 beginning with a brief confrontation with batman in the first issue 26 27 carmine falcone attempts to take over gotham city s criminal underworld initiating a gang war with penguin to provide a distraction falcone frames batman for the destruction of professor pyg s laboratory angry his work has been destroyed pyg sends his remaining dollotrons to assault batman who persuades pyg that falcone was responsible pyg retaliates by destroying the laboratory of one of falcone s paid scientists 28 he later turns several people into human animal hybrids whom he labels his farm hands and finds falcone after the farm hands kill falcone s guards pyg straps falcone to a table with the intention of operating on him but batman intervenes 29 he is arrested and sent to arkham asylum under the supervision of dr achilles milo 30 in convergence the new 52 crosses over with the previous iteration of the dc universe 31 during which pyg s pre new 52 counterpart is killed pyg is also featured in a chapter of the anthology digital comic series sensation comics featuring wonder woman 32 during robin war a crossover between several robin related publications published from december 2015 to january 2016 pyg uses an abandoned theatre for his criminal activities while working for the supervillain brother blood pyg escaped a confrontation with the teen titans 33 debut in other media edit professor pyg voiced by brian george became a recurring villain in the 2013 animated series beware the batman which was intended to focus on lesser known members of batman s rogues gallery to set it apart from previous batman television shows he appears alongside mister toad udo kier a humanoid toad as eco terrorists who hunt people for what they deem to be crimes against the animal kingdom pyg is still portrayed as a surgeon transforming his victims into human animal hybrids 5 34 35 36 the character later appeared in a side quest 5 of the 2015 video game batman arkham knight in which he is voiced by dwight schultz pyg is described as a gifted scientist who suffered a schizophrenic break that caused him to develop his persona in the game pyg uses his circus of strange business as a front for abducting people to turn into dollotrons after leaving behind a trail of corpses of failed experiments pyg is investigated and apprehended in a confrontation with batman the player character 37 pyg also made minor appearances in the animated series batman the brave and the bold and the video game injustice 2 5 in the harley quinn episode there s nowhere to go but down pyg makes a brief silent cameo among the prisoners in bane s pit lazlo valentin played by michael cerveris makes his live action debut in the fourth season of the television series gotham the character is introduced under his professor pyg alias as a vigilante who slaughters corrupt policemen and dresses their corpses with pigs heads 38 executive producer bryan wynbrandt described him as the big villain of the first half of the season 39 the character s modus operandi later expands he targets the wealthy who he claims fed on the poor of gotham 40 police captain james gordon learns professor pyg is a persona used by valentin a contract murderer who impersonates serial killers he is hired by crime figure sofia falcone in a conspiracy to turn the corrupt police against kingpin oswald cobblepot and usurp his criminal empire falcone kills valentin to keep the conspiracy quiet 41 dc rebirth and introduction in film edit in may 2016 dc comics again relaunched their entire line of comic books under the dc rebirth brand restoring elements of the dc universe that were erased under the new 52 while maintaining the continuity 42 pyg re appears in 2017 s nightwing 18 operating in paris and creating dollotron versions of grayson and damian wayne known as deathwing and robintron grayson and wayne overcome pyg who tells them he created deathwing and robintron for simon hurt 43 he later appears in harley quinn 43 44 and batgirl and the birds of prey 44 he appears again in batwoman 11 in which batwoman saves her ally julia pennyworth from pyg after alice leaks her secret identity to him 45 professor pyg is among the villains who feature in the intercompany crossover the shadow batman in which batman and the shadow team up to combat a conspiracy 46 47 pyg makes his film debut voiced by james urbaniak in the 2018 animated film suicide squad hell to pay 48 in which he is depicted as an underground surgeon for hire for supervillains in the limited series doomsday clock a sequel to the seminal 1986 watchmen pyg is among the supervillains who attend an underground meeting held by riddler 49 in a story in dc s 2018 halloween anthology cursed comics cavalcade damian wayne teams up with the zombie solomon grundy against professor pyg after he kidnaps a group of children 50 in january 2019 the mister miracle creative team tom king and mitch geralds reunited for batman 62 which was promoted as a special issue pyg holds batman captive as he recalls the mythical pygmalion and considers how he psychologically mirrors pyg 51 52 characterization and symbolism edit like the pygmalion of myth lazlo fancies himself something of a sculptor except he doesn t work in clay or marble he s much more fascinated with transforming living human bodies he has no real rhyme or reason for his crime he s really only motivated by his art there s no vendetta or plan or higher purpose pyg doesn t follow a pattern or even build up to a punchline he s not really angling for pure chaos like the joker but he s also not systematic like victor zsasz he just wants to spread his own twisted idea of perfection in his work no matter the cost meg downey in a dc comics editorial 53 professor pyg is usually characterized in comic books as someone who is suffering from severe mental illness cocreator grant morrison envisioned him as one of the weirdest most insane characters that s ever been in batman comics and said we hear a lot about batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected professor pyg isn t from another world he s from here but he s very very sick taking inspiration from the works of david lynch morrison wanted the visuals in batman reborn illustrated by frank quitely to feel like a real world crossing over with a world of schizophrenia paranoia and the use of narcotics they ve stated that when batman and robin are facing pyg and his dollotrons they are dealing with the eerie creepy mentally ill dark corners of life 2 the character uses drugs lobotomy and doll masks permanently molded onto people s faces to turn them into genderless dollotrons which he believes are perfected human beings 54 55 the name pyg is a shortening of pygmalion george bernard shaw s play that was adapted into the musical my fair lady starring rex harrison which tells the story of a professor s attempt to convert a street urchin into an educated high society woman according to morrison movie enthusiasts will know that rex harrison also played doctor doolittle who by strange coincidence was famed for teaching barnyard animals to speak proper so our professor pyg mixes all these characteristics and influences together to create a monster who wants to make everything and everyone perfect as he sees it 4 on the dc comics website journalist meg downey notes parallels between professor pyg s view of his dollotrons and the greek mythological figure pygmalion who carved a statue of a woman out of ivory that was so realistic and beautiful he fell in love with his creation 56 morrison referred to the character s experiments to force biology to conform to his will as an attempt to dominate and redefine the feminine principle comparing it to the wire mother experiments performed by psychologist harry harlow on infant monkeys and to the proto mother mythologies of mesopotamia and ancient babylon the shattered mind of lazlo valentin has mashed all of these connections into a frightening personal mythos constructed to justify his deranged activities as professor pyg 3 morrison also said pyg s deranged rants in batman and robin must die allude to animal experimentation carried out in the us in the mid twentieth century including harlow and john b calhoun s rockville barn rat population research which collectively influenced the character s origin story 57 in the comics pyg has a makeshift mother constructed from boards and nails from which auditory hallucinations continuously compel him to improve his work 8 in batman 62 bruce wayne compares pyg s love for his work to his own fixation with vigilantism having built up his ideals and philosophies since he witnessed his parents being murdered as a boy 58 pyg was adapted differently from the comics in the television series beware the batman developer glen murakami said it s not like we re trying to change it but we only have 22 minutes to tell that story the theme that we went in with pyg and toad was kind of wind in the willows but they also became like a twisted sherlock holmes and watson it felt like it flowed it felt like it had a theme that seemed more important for that to track rather than all the backstory 59 chris sims of the journalism website comicsalliance said the changes are about as far from melting people s faces stripping in front of a wire mother and dosing gotham city with a psychotropic drug as you re likely to get 36 according to comic book resources writer kieran shiach the arkham knight iteration is a very accurate facsimile of the original comic book portrayal the major difference being the character s new enthusiasm for opera music 5 pyg s in game attributes label him a perfectionist and an amateur opera vocalist before his confrontation with batman during which pyg describes his surgical operations as fixing his victims who are unique and broken batman is warned by alfred pennyworth that pyg is unhinged even by gotham s standards after pyg s capture he claims his mutilated victims are works of art and while in a police lockup he expresses concern for how they are being treated 37 in the television series gotham lazlo valentin is portrayed as a contract killer who impersonates other serial killers he creates an elaborate persona of a murderer under the professor pyg alias to aid sofia falcone s rise to power in gotham city s criminal underworld 60 actor michael cerveris said of the faux persona professor pyg is a brilliant and chameleon like person who has a highly developed sense of what s right and wrong it just might not be a sense of right and wrong that corresponds with everybody else s executive producer john stephens said the character was chosen for the show because he hits that sweet spot of being grotesque and terrifying but also a little bit in that fairy tale esque world cerveris said pyg takes delight in his actions and sees himself as a mirror image to james gordon who also wants to end corruption in the gotham city police department pyg spells his name with a y as an homage to pygmalion and because he wants to remake gotham city in his own image he also wants to make gordon into a better version of himself according to cerveris he is almost looking at gordon as an ally like i m on your side jim and jim is saying no you re actually a sociopath so it works in many ways as a seduction on pyg s part as he tries to pull jim in 61 62 in early episodes of gotham pyg claims to have suffered at the hands of gotham city s elite implying a troubled past for the pyg persona and a vengeful motive cerveris stated pyg is aware of his actions but may not be comfortable with himself which may be partly because he is covering his true identity layers of his disguise are continuously stripped down and reapplied 63 hailing from the southern united states valentin uses implanted shifting metal plates and facial reconstruction to help him hide his true identity 64 before the pyg persona is revealed to be fake cerveris said he lacks his alter ego s trademark surgical prowess because it was intended to focus more on his relationship with the city and james gordon and that the dollotrons are not the sole purpose of his existence cerveris also said the dollotrons might be a later part of valentin s life because the show is about the origins of the batman mythos 65 design edit professor pyg s traditional pig mask was adapted into one more resembling the flesh of a pig that according to michael cerveris gave it a more disturbing and comedic quality professor pyg most commonly wears a pig mask 66 a makeshift surgical outfit 54 and a butcher s apron much of his original wardrobe in the comic books was designed by frank quitely and is a homage to the edwardian suits worn by rex harrison in my fair lady 3 the television series gotham was planned to feature a pig mask that more closely resembled the comic book version but it was deemed a little too cheery and pink executive producer danny cannon decided the mask should look like decapitated pig flesh cerveris found the change to be simultaneously comical and disturbing he had some difficulty acting in the mask due to its weight and the heat underneath and because it blocked his peripheral vision according to cerveris the mask is a really freeing aspect and i felt naked when i didn t have the mask on and couldn t really be professor pyg pyg retains his apron from the source material 61 63 67 merchandise edit professor pyg s opera suite titled ode to perfection was composed by david buckley for the batman arkham knight soundtrack 68 69 an action figure of the character was released as part of the third series of arkham knight figures from dc collectibles in february 2016 70 critical response edit meg downey said professor pyg is one of batman s most disturbing villains 56 in 2015 ign writers jesse schedeen and joshua yehl ranked professor pyg as the twenty third greatest batman villain of all time 71 and in a separate editorial schedeen called pyg one of the crazier and more unusual batman villains created by grant morrison 66 beth elderkin of io9 called the character one of the weirdest villains to come out of the batman canon while bustle referred to him as one of the comics modern masterpieces and one of its most horrifying creations 72 73 david pepose of newsarama praised the inclusion of professor pyg and jason bard in batman eternal for emphasizing elements of the dc universe that were underused following the new 52 74 comic book resources s mike fugere said the character is a bigger monster than solomon grundy an undead creature within the dc universe who fugere calls terrifying he cited the comic book cursed comics cavalcade 1 as his reason a story in which grundy tries to stop pyg from mutilating a group of children according to fugere pyg is basically hannibal lecter on steroids and is a reminder that not all superhero comics are for kids he also said grant morrison accomplished his goal of making pyg one of the weirdest and most insane characters in batman comic books 50 in 2017 john stephens said professor pyg is one of his favorite recently created batman villains for being demented grotesque and funny because the character was created recently he also said pyg is more contemporary than the classic rogues and did not have to be revitalized as much 55 when it was announced professor pyg would appear on gotham digital spy commented gotham season 4 is going to introduce its most disturbing villain ever so forget about sleeping ever again 75 charlie ridgely of comicbook com stated pyg s appearance on gotham proved he is one of the most disturbed villains who has served as an antagonist to batman 76 see also edit list of beware the batman characters list of gotham characters references edit cowsill alan irvine alex
