published between 1988 and 1990 with art by chas truog and doug hazlewood brian bolland provided the covers although the series was initially conceived as a four issue limited series it was upgraded into an ongoing series following strong sales consequently morrison developed several long running plots introducing mysteries some of which were not explained until a year or two later the title featured the protagonist both in and increasingly out of costume morrison made the title character an everyman figure living in a universe populated by superheroes aliens and fantastic technology buddy s wife ellen his son cliff 9 years old at the beginning of the series and his daughter maxine 5 years old featured prominently in most storylines and his relationship with them as husband father

murderous spirit that was hunting him brutal murderous thanagarian warriors and even the easily defeated red robots of an elderly villain who was tired of life the series made deep sometimes esoteric references to the entire dc canon including b wana beast the mirror master and arkham asylum soon after the launch of his series animal man briefly became a member of justice league europe appearing in several early issues of their series following morrison s run peter milligan wrote a six issue story featuring several surreal villains and heroes exploring questions about identity and quantum

explores mystical totemic aspects of his powers jamie delano wrote 29 issues with steve pugh as artist with occasional issues by other artists like will simpson giving the series a more horror influenced feel with a suggested for mature readers label on the cover beginning with issue 51 vertigo edit after jamie delano s first six issues wherein among other things he killed off the central character of buddy baker created the red analogous to the green of swamp thing and resurrected buddy as an animal avatar the series became one of the charter titles of dc s new mature readers vertigo imprint with 57 and its ties to the dc universe became more tenuous vertigo was establishing itself as a distinct mini universe with its own continuity only occasionally interacting with the continuity of the regular dc universe the title evolved into a more horror themed book with buddy eventually becoming a non human animal god the superhero elements of the book were largely removed since buddy was reborn as a kind of animal elemental and legally deceased he discarded his costume stopped associating with other heroes and generally abandoned his crimefighting role he co founded the life power church of maxine to further an environmentalist message drifting along u s route 66 to settle in montana delano s final issue was 79 culminating in buddy dying several more times

concise august 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message buddy baker gained animal powers when he encountered a spaceship that blew up infusing him with radiation he used his powers to fight crime and ward off alien attackers he then joined the forgotten heroes group prior to the crisis on infinite earths he was seen with this group during the crisis baker s post crisis origin was slightly altered but it retained the essence of the original while hunting as a teenager he encountered a crashed spaceship that apparently endowed him with his abilities the slight discrepancies between the two stories were addressed as pre crisis and post crisis origins and were acknowledged in story with the original buddy baker appearing and not wishing to be written out of existence after an apparently unsuccessful stint as a superhero followed by a hiatus where he utilized his powers to work as a film stuntman baker decided to restart and make a career out of it after being inspired by the headline making justice league international this is where his self titled series begins he is married to his high school sweetheart ellen a storyboard artist and later an illustrator for

man becomes a man of great compassion toward all creatures an ardent animal rights activist an environmentalist and a vegetarian later he finds his link to the m field has been passed on to his daughter maxine who is also connected to the animal kingdom although he wears a mask he goes to no great lengths to conceal his true identity a jacket was added to animal man s costume so he could have pockets and a place to put his keys as well as notes from his wife however this jacket was denim and not a leather jacket buddy specifically discusses that he will not wear leather out of moral considerations an early aspect of the character was his desire for fame and is manifested by his wish to be in the justice league he is initially driven by a desire for the publicity from interviews and public appearances more than any altruistic impulse buddy joins the newly formed justice league europe and bonds with dmitri of the rocket reds over the shared experiences of being fathers 17 he soon resigns due to tragic events taking place later in his series 18 after a brief period of reconditioning and exploration of his limits baker s first work is a job from s t a r labs investigating a break in at an animal testing facility he traces it to the hero b wana beast whom he is able to befriend and aid the conditions he witnesses at the testing facilities compel him to become vegetarian a

murder by a mysterious organization upset with his environmental work and must face the new mirror master baker is also pursued by dr james highwater a physicist with no memory of any prior existence and seemingly no purpose other than to contact baker a parallel story involves a pair of yellow aliens described as agents of some unspecified higher power that engineered the spaceship wreck that granted his powers who are aware of the events of the crisis and monitor baker s actions they are aware of a second crisis coming which they believe that only animal man can avert they reconcile the two variations of animal man s origin through an unexplained surgery that also extends his abilities elsewhere in arkham asylum the psycho pirate aware of continuity and his fictional environment opens a gateway into the real world and other comic book realities and begins bringing several characters no longer in continuity into existence 19 baker is demoralized however when firefighters are injured in a laboratory blaze started by activists that he was working with he is approached by highwater just as he decides to give up his costumed identity while away on a vision quest with highwater in which he learns the true nature of his powers and briefly sees the comic s reader baker s family is brutally murdered by an assassin sent by the corporate heads seeking to stop his

write after this encounter baker is sent back home and his family are restored back to life it is left ambiguous as to whether or not baker remembers the full nature of these events next after falling

series 43 powers and abilities edit buddy can mimic the abilities of any animal as a result of his encounter with a crashed alien spacecraft he does this by either focusing on a specific animal near him or as he learns later by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general this enables him to even mimic animals that are extinct the nature of these powers has been described in various ways including the superficial alien radiation explanation of his early appearances the reconstruction of his body by aliens with morphogenetic grafts at the cellular level and currently mystical access to a morphogenetic field created by all living creatures also known as the red he does not grow wings to fly as a bird instead he flies in classic superman style nor does he form gills to breathe underwater when mimicking a fish but he has occasionally been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals such as adopting the claws of a wolverine temporarily or his metamorphosis toward the end of delano s run on his series among the animal powers buddy has been known to use are the strength of a tyrannosaurus rex the flight of a bird the swimming ability of a fish the speed of an ant the reflexes of a fly the eloquence of a parrot the wall crawling of a spider the sonic blast of a pistol shrimp the sense of smell of a moth the stench of a skunk the color changing of a chameleon the agility of a snake the playfulness of a kitten the electricity of an electric eel and electric ray a worm s ability to re grow lost body parts the righteous anger of a mother bear the bark of a large dog the reproduction abilities of protozoa the durability of a cockroach the ability to fire lightning from his face from an unidentified alien creature the beauty of a monarch butterfly the smell of a hippopotamus the napping ability of a cat the level of buddy s abilities is proportional to the size of the animal they are drawn from hence drawing the jumping ability from a flea would allow him to cover great distances however taking the abilities of a larger animal does not result in diminished power for him in some appearances he can also talk to animals and enter their minds tapping into the red animal man can also fire blasts of force or unidentified energy in cooperation with vixen and the woman known as tristess he helped to create an entire universe 44 in 52 buddy experiences an
