justice league international 10 and was created by keith giffen and j m dematteis during their justice league period 3 his name was originally spelled gnort his semi human face manner of speech and style of dress showed that the inspiration for the character was sewer worker ed norton played by art carney in the classic television series the honeymooners however in later appearances his face became more canine and the spelling of his name was changed 4 fictional character biography edit g nort is from the planet g newt hal jordan explains that g nort became a green lantern due to the influence of his uncle who was a famous member of the lantern corps 2 despite his obviously limited intelligence not intelligent enough to read a map and profoundly lacking tactical judgment the character is consistently depicted as brave loyal and honorable this fact is overlooked by most heroes although superman has pointed it out on occasion early in his career g nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the league s battle against the manhunters recognizing g nort s general incompetence the corps had given him an uninhabited sector of space to patrol the fact that the region was uninhabited also suited the needs of the manhunters who set up their home planet in g nort s sector g nort joined hal jordan superman and other justice league members in an assault on the home world although g nort s main contribution was getting stuck in the planet s ventilation system 5 working with the league edit g nort s arch enemy the scarlet skier a take off of marvel s silver surfer is described as being the only felon g nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career also an idiot the skier was mistaken for a pan handling homeless person when traveling in the subway g nort goes on a mission to rescue mister miracle from the interstellar trader manga khan traveling in a spaceship g nort works with big barda martian manhunter and dmitri of the rocket reds they chase down khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer lobo 6 both g nort and the skier were founding members of justice league antarctica created by maxwell lord for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed injustice league out of his way the league including g nort find their antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins their enemies are ultimately destroyed but not before the facility itself gets demolished g nort keeps himself and his new found allies alive via his power ring until help arrives 7 g nort assists the league this time consisting of manhunter crimson fox and ice when mr nebula the skier s old boss turns his dangerous cosmic powered attention to earth mr nebula saw the garishness of las vegas and thought earth had the same taste as he and thus left 8 g nort sees himself as a green lantern at large not bound to a single space sector his most successful mission apart from capturing the skier has been when a gang of interstellar bank robbing humanoid cats surrender as soon as he appears qward battle edit eventually it is discovered that both g nort and his uncle g newman were actually given their rings by the poglachians who posed as the guardians of the universe while the real guardians were with the zamarons a race of clowns the poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways they were actually pawns of the weaponers of qward who hoped to discredit the green lantern corps by having the name associated with idiots g nort works with guy gardner ending up in qward itself 9 though g nort loses his qwardian powered ring their confrontations against a qwardian sinestro cult goes badly faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed g nort gives up the location of hal jordan soon after powerless but free from a qwardian cell g nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down the soldier swiftly overpowers g nort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would torture and kill guy enraged g nort defeats the soldier gains his ring and saves guy by destroying the source of his very own power the two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area afterwards
