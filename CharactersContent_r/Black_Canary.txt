8 external links publication history edit robert kanigher and carmine infantino created the character in 1947 to be featured in flash comics as a supporting character appearing first as a clandestine crime fighter who infiltrates criminal organizations to break them from the inside the black canary was drawn with fishnet stockings and a black leather jacket to connote images of a sexualized yet strong female character 2 she appeared as a character in a back up story featuring johnny thunder i was drawing johnny thunder which was not much of a character i suppose he could have been better because his thunderbolt was interesting but the situations they were in were pretty juvenile bob kanigher wrote those stories and he had no respect for the characters these stories were nowhere near as good as the flash stories dc knew it they knew johnny thunder was a loser so kanigher and i brought the black canary into the series immediately she got a good response and it was bye bye johnny thunder nobody missed him 3 carmine infantino according to amash and nolen weathington 2010 black canary is really carmine infantino s first character 3 according to the artist when kanigher gave me the script i said how do you want me to draw her he said what s your fantasy of a good looking girl that s what i want isn t that a great line so that s what i did i made her strong in character and sexy in form the funny part is that years later while in korea on a national cartoonists trip i met a dancer who was the exact image of the black canary and i went out with her for three years bob didn t ask me for a character sketch for the black canary he had a lot of respect for me i must say that he always trusted my work bob loved my black canary design 3 dinah drake edit main article black canary dinah drake at her golden age debut the black canary was the alter ego of dinah drake and participated in crime fighting adventures with her love interest and eventual husband gotham city detective larry lance 4 initially the character was a hand to hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs later stories depicted her as a world class martial artist with a superpower the canary cry a high powered sonic scream which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes when dc comics adjusted its continuity the black canary was established as two separate entities mother and daughter dinah drake lance and dinah laurel lance stories since the silver age focused on the younger black canary ascribing her superhuman abilities to a genetic mutation dinah laurel lance edit main article black canary dinah laurel lance following the universe altering events of crisis on infinite earths concluding in march 1986 the black canary s history was revised again the mind transplant story of 1983 was discarded in this version of the story the present day black canary is dinah laurel lance who inherits the identity from her mother dinah drake lance although some references for example those in james robinson s starman series tried to distinguish between the two canaries by calling the first diana recent accounts have confirmed dinah as the mother s given name the two canaries origin stories were told in full in secret origins vol 2 50 august 1990 in this story dinah drake is trained by her father detective richard drake intending to follow him on the gotham city police force when she is turned down her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards determined to honor his memory dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means she becomes a costumed vigilante using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job 5 dinah marries her lover private eye larry lance and several years later their daughter dinah laurel lance is born birds of prey 66 june 2004 would establish that they took the name laurel from a librarian dinah befriended during a case 6 new 52 version edit during dc s the new 52 era which began in 2011 black canary was portrayed as a single character with a metahuman canary cry resulting from government experiments on an alien child named ditto this version of black canary founded the birds of prey on her own and led the super team team 7 alongside her husband kurt lance before later becoming lead singer in a rock band called black canary after five years dc later began to row back on controversial new 52 continuity changes with its dc rebirth initiative with the narrator of geoff johns dc rebirth 1 wally west lamenting from outside the universe on how black canary and green arrow hardly know each other anymore when they should be husband and wife as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline the comic shows the pair briefly meeting by chance and then separately staying up at night contemplating what is missing from their lives they meet again in green arrow rebirth 1 and instantly hit it off as part of rebirth black canary also re establishes the traditional birds of prey line up with batgirl and huntress and also joins the justice league of america following subsequent continuity restoring events in doomsday clock and dark nights death metal the current black canary is re established as being the daughter of her golden age predecessor fully reversing the controversial new 52 changes and bringing an end to the distinctive new 52 version of the character 7 the largely erased new 52 versions of the dc heroes were established as residing on earth 52 in the comic book series doomsday clock 8 powers abilities and equipment edit although depictions of the black canary have varied over the years the character is often portrayed as a prodigious hand to hand combatant having mastered styles such as aikido 9 boxing capoeira hapkido judo 10 11 12 jujutsu kung fu krav maga muay thai shuri te 12 and wing chun 13 she has been trained by other top tier fighters such as wildcat lady shiva cassandra cain and wonder woman as well as having bested batman from time to time in hand to hand combat in addition to her martial arts skills the black canary has been depicted as an expert motorcyclist gymnast covert operative and investigator she is also an excellent leader and tactician having served as the field commander of the birds of prey and the leader of the justice league and league of assassins for a time her superpower the canary cry 14 allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects her canary cry has been depicted as having 10 fold the capabilities of most sonic weapons and has even been depicted as breaking metals and having the resonance to affect and shatter earth 15 in the new 52 her canary cry now grants her the ability to glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards 16 due to this reliance on speech she is often bound and gagged by villains as a means of incapacitation despite her power the black canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations such as against superpowered opponents the origin of the black canary s canary cry has been retconned throughout her character history with it being originally depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the wizard later the cry is depicted as an inborn metahuman ability briefly during the new 52 era her ability was depicted as resulting from gene splicing experiments using samples from an alien girl named ditto 17 reception edit the black canary is ranked the
