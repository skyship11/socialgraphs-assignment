on to the project until after the chief was created 3 drake has confirmed in an interview that his inspiration for the chief was the works of sir arthur conan doyle specifically sherlock holmes elder brother mycroft 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit niles caulder is a paraplegic with genius intelligence 5 caulder uses his scientific knowledge to develop numerous inventions and innovations that have made him wealthy caulder founded and organized the team called doom patrol to protect the innocent and fight crime and to teach humanity to accept others who live as ostracized freaks who have been radically transformed from terrible accidents 1 it is caulder s genius that allowed the team members to survive e g designing robotman s body devising negative man s medicated bandages and helped grant their freakishness and amazing abilities 6 caulder developed an interest in creating better life at a young age proving at a young age to be both a brilliant inventor and engineer caulder received funding from a mysterious benefactor thanks to the funding caulder succeeded in creating a chemical capable of prolonging life ultimately it was revealed that the benefactor was a man called general immortus who hired caulder to create a chemical to replace the one that had been prolonging his life for centuries but was now failing when the young scientist discovered the truth about his employer he refused to continue the work immortus responded by implanting an explosive device in caulder s upper torso which he could set off remotely and any attempt to remove it while niles lived would also detonate it caulder eventually devised a plan to get the bomb out but it cost him his ability to walk 7 the incident inspired and reminded caulder that a better life may come from surviving a tragic event such as his own in the early years of the patrol caulder not only kept his true identity and appearance secret from the public even his team knew him only as the chief in issue 88 june 1964 their third battle against immortus forces him to tell the rest of the patrol his back story and real name which suddenly and with no explanation becomes common public knowledge for the rest of the original 1960s series even two flashback miniseries that ran in the back of the comic detailing how cliff steele and larry trainor became freaks and were recruited by caulder casually used the name post crisis edit niles caulder s back history seemingly remained intact following the events of crisis on infinite earths however when writer grant morrison took over the doom patrol title starting with vol 2 19 they reimagined him as a cold detached and somewhat mysterious individual near the end of their run morrison even revealed that caulder had been responsible for the accidents that caused the original doom patrol members to gain their powers since his personal philosophy is that true greatness comes through overcoming tragic events while volunteering for the peace corps in the 1960s in calcutta india niles caulder met arani desai and the two fell in love he gave her immortality on their wedding night and left her in a monastery in the himalayas sensing danger from his mysterious benefactor caulder had been hired to develop a serum to increase a person s life span indefinitely while working on the project caulder discovered that his mysterious benefactor was actually a villain named general immortus immortus planted a bomb in caulder s chest and would only remove it when caulder had developed the serum immortus shot caulder and while he was technically dead his robot surgeon removed the bomb and revived him due to the robot s crude surgical technique the chief lost the use of his legs fearing that immortus would never stop until he was dead he decided to form a team of heroic misfits to fight immortus this team became the first incarnation of the doom patrol in keeping with the above retcon that he manipulated the original doom patrol s transformations it has been revealed that caulder had also experimented on other characters in the world who would both benefit and destroy humanity the most noted are a bitter group called the brotherhood of evil a group of people who also live like freaks led by the brain the brotherhood exists as an elitist paramilitary organization involved in terrorist acts around the world such as the destruction of the american city bl√ºdhaven occasionally attempting global control of humanity and the death and destruction of niles caulder for causing their tragic transformations towards the end of grant morrison s doom patrol run caulder is discovered working on a nanotechnology bomb that will destroy half the world and replace it with humans transformed into freaks of nature his theory being that from the destruction would rise a better human race he murders the original tempest joshua clay to protect his secret but the doom patrol succeed in stopping his plans 2 cover to doom patrol 67 art by tom taggart during these events he is killed by a creation of dorothy spinner s known as the candlemaker doctor will magnus of the metal men builds a new body for the chief telling him that he should try helping the patrol to make up for what he did becoming suicidal with guilt the chief states that he can never do enough to make up for his actions and uses his new body to rip off his head magnus is able to save the chief by getting the head to a cryogenic chamber but after this the chief exists solely as a disembodied head in a bucket of ice subsisting on milkshakes he expresses remorse at his actions and rebuilds the doom patrol to continue their efforts in the war against weird crime in the final issues of the series the chief had combined himself with alice wired for sound one of the srs sexually remaindered spirits who powered the dp teleporter as a means for more mobility during the last story arc imagine ari s friends the chief died entering the tree of life the sephirot infinite crisis edit after superboy prime s pounding on the barriers to reality certain events are rewritten 8 and niles has his body back and still acts as the team leader it has been revealed that he apparently still is responsible for the creation of the original members of the patrol though they claim to have forgiven him caulder now seems to be intent on expanding the doom patrol s ranks he has already convinced beast boy to return to the team and formally join it for the first time and gotten bumblebee and vox to join robin doubts the chief s motives and after seeing him appear to manipulate elasti girl robin accuses him of brainwashing the doom patrol by keeping them dependent on him for his part caulder maintains that by joining the doom patrol team members won t have to be freaks anymore later when caulder is overheard telling kid devil that his teammates do not like him and he should join the doom patrol the others finally see that he is controlling them with fear and self loathing while caulder tells them that they need him mento finally takes off his helmet allowing him to think clearly mento then informs the chief that he is no longer their leader and if he ever speaks to elasti girl or beast boy like that again he will destroy caulder s intellect shocked by this the chief rushes off to his lab also in the teen titans story volume issue needed it is also revealed that caulder brutally murdered the scientist who would become the brain because they were both working on general immortus potion and caulder was jealous of the brain s genius and tried to blow up the other scientist s lab in order to force him to become robotman prior to cliff steele s accident that made him the character of the same name brain also reveals that he and the doom patrol are not the only innocent humans whose bodies are mutilated against their will by caulder to create his own personal super hero team two never before mentioned characters electric blu and
