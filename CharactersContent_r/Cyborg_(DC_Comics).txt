head by deathlok then i decided to make him more robotic than android by making more metallic parts of him so that he wasn t quite as human but the half face metallic plate was obviously inspired by deathlok by rich buckler and then i used a young jim brown as my inspiration for how i would handle the body language for the character 3 character biography edit victor stone as cyborg as he appeared in the new teen titans comic book series in the 1980s art by george pérez victor stone is the son of silas stone and elinore stone scientists who use him as a test subject for various intelligence enhancement projects while these treatments are ultimately successful and victor s iq subsequently grows to genius levels he grows to resent his treatment victor strikes up a friendship with ron evers a young miscreant who leads him into trouble with the law this is the beginning of a struggle in which victor strives for independence engaging in pursuits of which his parents disapprove such as athletics and abandoning his studies victor s association with underage criminals leads him down a dark path in which he is often injured but he still lives a normal life in which he is able to make his own decisions however this rebellious path does not bury victor s conscience considering that he refuses to participate in evers grandiose plans of racially motivated terrorism victor s situation changes radically when he visits his parents lab where experiments in inter dimensional access are done at that moment of his entry an aggressive gelatinous creature was accidentally pulled through and victor s mother is killed by it it then turned on victor and he was severely injured by its attack before his father was able to send it back to its native dimension with his wife dead and his son mutilated unconscious and near death from the incident silas is driven to take advantage of prototype medical prosthetic research he has access to in order to treat victor unfortunately victor only regains consciousness after the extensive artificial limbs and implants were installed in his body without his consent victor was horrified at the discovery of the metallic components which involve most of the left side of his head and face and raged that he would rather have died than be such a victim of his father s manipulations although his bitterness remained for some time victor eventually calmed down enough to successfully adjust to his implants physically he found himself rejected by the public because of his implants including his girlfriend who would later thoughtlessly blurt out that she would prefer he had died instead of being in that state however victor s conscience was unbowed as evidenced by the fact that when evers tried to manipulate him into participating in a terrorist attack on the united nations victor decided to equip himself with his weaponized attachments and stop him on the top of united nations headquarters teen titans edit when robin assembles the teen titans victor joins initially for the benefit of a support group of kindred spirits and freaks and has remained with that group ever since 2 fortunately victor eventually finds additional new civilian friends such as a group of juveniles who are adjusting to their own prosthetics and idolize him because of his fancy parts and his exciting adventures it also turns out that their beautiful teacher sarah simms who has often assisted cyborg and the titans admires him as well another person who sees past the cybernetic shell is dr sarah charles a s t a r labs scientist who helps him to recuperate after having his cybernetic parts replaced cyborg and dr charles date for some time and she along with changeling keeps trying to reach him when he is seemingly mindless following the severe injuries he incurs during the titans hunt storyline deaths and rebirths edit victor stone as cyberion is reunited with sarah charles although cyborg s body was repaired by a team of russian scientists after the missile crash he had been in albeit with more mechanical parts than previously his mind was not eventually his mind was restored by an alien race of computer intelligences called the technis created from the sexual union of swamp thing and a machine planet when swamp thing was travelling through space cyborg however had to remain with the technis both to maintain his mind and because in return for restoring him he had to teach them about humanity he took the name cyberion and gradually started becoming less human in outlook connecting entirely to the technis planet eventually cyberion returned to earth establishing a technis construct on the moon and a smaller base on earth with vic s consciousness dormant but his desire for companionship controlling the actions of the technis planet it began kidnapping former titans members his conscious mind so suppressed that he was not only searching for deceased titans but even sent one probe looking for himself as cyborg he ended up plugging them into virtual reality scenarios representing what he believed to be their perfect worlds for example beast boy was back with the doom patrol damage was spending time being congratulated by the justice society as a true hero and nightwing was confronted by a batman who actually smiled and offered to talk about their relationship although the titans were freed there was a strong disagreement between them and the justice league over what action to take the league believed that there was nothing left of victor to save whereas the titans were willing to try culminating in a brief battle where the atom and catwoman who had followed the justice league to investigate sided with the league while the flash fought with the titans until the two were convinced to work together after batman and nightwing found the system containing vic s core consciousness while vic was distracted trying to aid his friends a titans team consisting of changeling and the original five titans were sent by raven to try making contact with vic s human side while superman wonder woman green lantern the martian manhunter power girl captain marvel and mary marvel moved the moon back to its proper place eventually thanks primarily to changeling s encouragement and omen and raven holding vic together long enough to come up with a plan vic s consciousness was restored and downloaded into the omegadrome a morphing war suit belonging to former titan minion in the wake of this event the titans reformed and vic was part of the new group 2 however he felt less human than ever before shortly after this nightwing revealed he had cloned vic s body and by flowing the omegadrome through the clone vic regained his human form but still had the abilities of the omegadrome he often used the omegadrome to recreate his original look in battle with his newfound humanity vic took a leave of absence moving first to l a with beast boy and then to central city while in central city vic was involved in one of the thinker s schemes helping wally hack the thinker s attempt to plug himself into the minds of central city s population so that wally could outthink his opponent though vic lost the abilities of the omegadrome in the process mentor edit vic mentored the new incarnation of the teen titans consisting mainly of sidekicks most of whom have taken over the identities of former members i e tim drake the third robin instead of dick grayson the original robin and titans leader as well as stalwarts such as starfire raven and beast boy where they have fought enemies such as deathstroke brother blood doctor light the titans tomorrow and a brainwashed superboy and indigo during a team up with the outsiders in the insiders storyline in the end cyborg was the only one capable of standing up to dr light thanks to his solar shields although he makes it clear that he only won the fight because the rest of the titans had softened light up first infinite crisis and beyond edit during the 2005 2006 storyline infinite crisis cyborg joined donna s new cronus team that went to investigate a hole in the universe that was found during the rann thanagar war he left beast boy in charge of the titans while he was gone they arrived at the reset center of the universe and with the help of assorted heroes aided in the defeat of alexander luthor who was attempting to recreate the multiverse and build a perfect earth from it according to 52 week 5 cyborg was fused together with firestorm after returning to earth this was caused by the energy ripples caused by alexander luthor jr which altered the zeta ray beams the heroes were going to use to return home after being severely damaged during the events of infinite crisis cyborg was rebuilt over time in thanks to tower caretakers wendy and marvin he awoke a year later to find a wholly different teen titans being led by robin the only member from the team he formed prior to going into space he is still a member of the team but feels that kid devil and ravager are hardly worthy titans and thus is attempting to find a way to reform the real titans after the team along with the doom patrol defeated the brotherhood of evil cyborg asked beast boy to rejoin the titans but gar refused saying that his skills were needed with the doom patrol after returning to titans tower cyborg began reviewing the security tapes during the last year in which it appears that he was looked to by all the titans of the past year for a shoulder to lean on despite being in a coma like state it appears that although cyborg has returned to the team the role of leader is now in the hands of robin he does however retain the position of statesman amongst the team and occasionally plays second in command in justice league of america vol 2 3 batman wonder woman and superman agree that cyborg should be offered membership in the new justice league however following a battle against amazo green lantern and black canary take over the formation of the jla and cyborg is not amongst the roster in the teen titans east one shot cyborg gathered together a new team of titans during a training exercise the group was attacked by trigon and cyborg was blasted by a giant energy beam he was last seen in a crater with only his head and torso remaining titans edit in the aftermath of trigon s assault in the

jericho the plot works too well when vigilante appears and shoots cyborg in the head 5 2008 miniseries edit in an unspecified time during the teen titans comics a man with enhancements similar to cyborg s attacks dr sarah charles on the day of her wedding to deshaun a young scientist cyborg rushes in for the save discovering how deshaun connected to project m has sold the technology used to turn stone into cyborg to the military he also finds that the enhanced man was ron evers once vic s best friend now turned terrorist who was seeking vengeance for the soldiers used as test subjects

the fearsome five magenta girder the thinker and cyborgirl although the cyborg revenge squad soon gains the upper hand with the help of his fellow titans cyborg is able to hold his own in combat reverse engineer on the fly some of the future technology used by cyborg 2 0 and enhance his own body enough to win against mr orr he later decides to get a new lease in life forgiving deshaun and sarah charles on their wedding day for abusing his technology resuming dating sarah simms and having the phantom limbs fitted with new non military prosthetics it is however implied the phantom limbs

the power ring crisis cyborg wondered what he saw within the ring after his dad warned him interfacing with it again could trap him in it forever 38 an incident involving batman s son damian wayne during the robin rises alpha omega story arc in batman led up to most of the justice league battling against glorious godfrey and a parademon horde from apokolips when they captured the chaos shard and the sarcophagus of damian before retreating back home 39 all the league members present cyborg included state to an adamant bruce wayne that running headlong into unmarked x factor territory for a suicide mission was less than ideal considering the consequences that could befall the earth this eventually culminates with batman hijacking cyborg s teleportation systems to zip up to the watchtower in an attempt to retrieve an experimental and highly dangerous combat suit in order to mete out his agenda but cyborg manages to block his administrative access so that he shazam aquaman wonder woman

from a parademon kept in cold storage to vacate to apokolips 41 after making his way to the batcave to meet with them he s directed over to a console which enabled him to directly access the batcomputer s more sophisticated systems however it was all a ruse utilizing a preemptive countermeasure devised by batman tailored to cyborg s specific weaknesses cyborg was temporarily incapacitated and was set into a vr simulation where he relived his more peaceful days in college while batgirl went to work on his mother box in order to secure a path towards apokolips and chase after their father but victor eventually snapped out of his dream haze and followed them through angered that they used him in such away 41 cyborg traveled along with titus who hitched a ride on his leg to catch up with the rest of the batman family they all then have a run in with the scavengers of armegeddo who quickly vacate after some apokoliptian hunger dogs make their way onto the scene they eventually

remind him of his purpose causing him to snap out of his berserker rage and note that cyborg had reluctantly accompanied them to hell itself having made their way into darkseid s citadel where kalibak was readying his chaos cannon to fire again the caped crusaders kept darkseid s forces occupied while cyborg made short work of the massive war engine literally tearing it in half but when he went to set a timed self destruct sequence within the apokoliptian computers vic suffered catastrophic feedback that fried most of his internal systems leaving him inoperable just as darkseid himself made his appearance 42 while batman fought and held darkseid off cyborg ran batgirl through a crash course on how to hotwire his own mother box since darkseid smashed batman s boom tube generator cyborg was their only chance off apokolips after successfully jury rigging his internal systems cyborg and the rest of the bat rogues made a hasty exit stage left as bruce powered his recovered fragment of the chaos shard with darkseid s omega effect blasting darkseid against a wall to cover their escape 43 in the aftermath cyborg who is still unable to facilitate himself wonders what is going on as damian wayne is successfully revived however a second anomaly cranks out of the boom tube that was opened and kalibak comes charging through it with kalibak occupied by the rest of the gang vic tries his best to reestablish his downed systems he is successful and gains control over the still open tube as batman readies the batplane as batman rams his jet into the evil new god sending him careening back to apokolips cyborg closes the portal banishing darkseid s firstborn for good with the threat over cyborg heads back topside to inform the rest of the league of what all transpired and stating he

learn the secrets of his teammates as the crisis escalates cyborg is confronted by the controlling consciousness of other mother boxes who claim that he will only gain the power to overcome the dark batmen if he fully surrenders to the mother box that powers his body at the cost of the transformation deleting his old personality he is nearly tempted to give in to this transformation but the appearance of raven s soul self convinces him to hold on to himself while partially succumbing to the transformation this allows him to free his teammates and hack the multiverse as they travel to find new allies in the battle against the dark batmen following this and the justice league no justice miniseries the justice league series was canceled after 43 issues and was relaunched into a new monthly series and cyborg will also be featured as part of a separate justice league faction that is part of the new justice league odyssey series in addition cyborg s own solo monthly series was also canceled and ended in june 2018 with the release of issue 23 46 abilities edit large portions of victor stone s body have been replaced by advanced mechanical parts hence the name cyborg granting him superhuman strength speed stamina and flight his mechanically enhanced body much of which is metallic is far more durable than a normal human body cyborg s internal computer system can interface with external computers other features include an electronic eye which replicates vision but at a superhuman level his mechanical parts contain a wide variety of tools and weapons such as a grappling hook line and a finger mounted laser perhaps his most frequently used weapon is his sound amplifier often referred to as his white sound blaster in the comic books the teen titans animated series calls it a sonic cannon which can be employed at various settings either to stun his foes or to deliver concentrated blasts of sound potent enough to shatter rock and deform steel 47 cyborg is consistently depicted as making adjustments to his cybernetic parts enhancing his functions and abilities to levels beyond those set by his father this change has allowed writers to adjust his powers as needed for various stories following dc s new 52 reboot in 2011 cyborg s origin story was changed so that his enhancements were the product of alien technology specifically that of a mother box from the planet new genesis his cybernetics are now seen as a living extension of his body and a host of new skills such as emp blasts technology absorption and underwater adaptation were added to his powerset most significantly he was given the ability to generate boom tubes powerful teleportation tunnels that are used by the new gods to travel vast distances due to this mother box connection elements of victor s original backstory were re established following dc s trinity war storyline when his father rebuilds systems following extensive damage to them in addition to his mechanical enhancements stone
