editions 8 references 9 external links development edit grell described the warlord s genesis as a comic strip called savage empire savage empire was born of my admiration for hal foster s prince valiant and burne hogarth s tarzan combined with my fascination with archaeology and lost civilizations grell described pitching his idea to dc comics i completely revised the concept from savage empire into the warlord the story of an archeologist who stumbles through a time portal and winds up in atlantis became the story of us spy pilot whose sr 71 is damaged while on a mission over russia and plunges through an opening at the north pole into the world at the center on the earth where creatures of from mythology and earth s ancient past co exist amid fantastic cities and leftovers of the civilization of atlantis drawing on many sources including my own us air force experiences to lend a note of authenticity to the characters background choosing the new setting was easy as a kid one of my favorite books was jules verne s 1864 classic journey to the center of the earth i also drew on the smoky god the hollow earth and edgar rice burroughs pellucidar series 2 publication
