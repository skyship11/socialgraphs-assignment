1983 lobo is an alien born on the utopian planet of czarnia and works as an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter 1 lobo was first introduced as a hardened villain in the 1980s but soon fell out of use with writers he remained in limbo until his revival as a bounty hunter with his own comic in the early 1990s writers attempted to use lobo as a parody of the 1990s trend towards grim and gritty superhero stories epitomized by such marvel comics characters as cable wolverine and punisher but he was instead enthusiastically accepted by fans of the trend 2 this popularity led to the character having a much higher profile in dc comics stories from then on as well as starring roles in various series in the decades since lobo made his live action debut in the 2019 premiere episode of the second season of the television series krypton portrayed by emmett j scanlan contents 1 character development 2 publication history 3 fictional character biography 3 1 crossovers 3 2 l e g i o n r e b

development edit the character enjoyed a short run as one of dc s most popular characters throughout the 1990s this version of lobo was intended to be a satire of the marvel comics superhero wolverine in issue 41 of deadpool a separate marvel series lobo was parodied as dirty wolff a large blue skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle he was also parodied in the image comics series bloodwulf and as bolo in the topps comics series satan s six in a 2006 interview keith giffen said i have no idea why lobo took off i came up with him as an indictment of the punisher wolverine hero prototype and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy go figure 3 he later stated that both lobo and ambush bug were derived from lunatik a character he created in high school 4 lobo was the favorite dc comics character of stan lee 5 publication history edit lobo was introduced as a regular character in keith giffen and roger slifer s green lantern and teen titans spin off omega men 6 at that time

easter bunny to assassinate santa claus infanticide where he kills his daughter and all of his other offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him convention special a send up of comic book conventions and unamerican gladiators in which lobo takes part in a deadly televised game show simon bisley s dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel lobo also starred in his own dc title for 64 issues from 1993 to 1999 lobo has regularly made guest appearances in other series even in cross company interactions with such non dc characters as the mask judge dredd and the authority during the dc vs marvel crossover series he fought wolverine and lost due to popular vote by the fans he also

be released but both were cancelled however an adult animated black comedy web series was made in 2000 with 14 shorts fictional character biography edit lobo is a czarnian with exceptional strength and fortitude he enjoys nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication and killing as an end in itself his name roughly translates as he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it he is arrogant and self centered focusing almost solely on his own pleasures although he proudly lives up to the letter of his promises but always no more or no less than what he promised lobo is the last of his kind having committed complete genocide by killing all the other czarnians for fun as detailed in lobo 0 lobo unleashed a violent plague of flying scorpions upon his home world killing most of its citizens the first appearance of lobo physically lobo resembles a chalk white human male with generally blood red pupilless eyes with blackened eyelids like many comic book characters lobo

as a gray mane later a long straggly gray black rocker hair dreadlocks and more recently a pompadour similarly the orange and purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances was replaced by black

home a few have been killed in separate incidents which he avenges with his usual violence lobo s friends include dawg a bulldog that he often claims is not his when it gets into trouble jonas glim a fellow bounty hunter ramona a bail bondswoman hairdresser and guy gardner whose friendship was cemented when lobo came by guy s bar warriors where he gave guy one of his space hogs and the skull of

a restaurant al s diner where he often flirts with al s only waitress darlene though lobo protects these two from frequent danger he does not seem to understand the distress caused by his tendency to

him a last job finding a legendary evildoer named malo perverso at the prospect of a last well paid job and a chance to score with the client lobo quickly agrees and again invades the diner to use

reaching his gear lobo invades the hq of the international justice legion wanna bes and crushes all opposition in order to hack their files on malo perverso there he is attacked by perverso himself who then reveals himself to be clayman the team s shapeshifter who admits he impersonated perverso to get rid of lobo clayman also squeals that the real perverso went into a black hole lobo still eager to find his bounty goes into the black hole ironically due to lobo s interference in a planetary conflict in the same issue al later gets a package through the tesseract for lobo which promptly blows the diner up yet again at one point lobo has trouble with a clone of himself that had survived previous misadventures a battle between the two makes it unclear which of them survived some fans

redesigned lobo was introduced in justice league 23 2 cultured and well educated although ruthless this lobo is an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter with a leaner physique akin to the character s earlier appearances this new version sets course for earth after discovering his counterpart a czarnian imposter had been there according to this version s backstory lobo was originally the bodyguard to the czarnian royal family who utilized a eucharist like ritual involving the planet s life blood pools similar to the lazarus pits drinking or bathing in these pools granted participants regenerative abilities connecting them and the emperor himself to the entire planet however an unknown party contaminated the life blood causing the czarnian emperor and any citizenry that had

all comic books lobo is portrayed as a ruthless bounty hunter he only has one rule once he takes a contract he finishes it no matter what even if it means risking injury if he has a counter contract for even more money then he will fulfill the new one lobo possesses extraordinary strength of undefined limits his strength much like his other powers varies greatly depending upon different artistic interpretations by various comic book writers in some instances he is depicted as being barely stronger than a human while in others he demonstrates physical strength on a similar level to superman he has shown to be a match in strength for etrigan the demon each time that they have met lobo also possesses superhuman durability which varies greatly too lobo is depicted in some situations as being injured by conventional bullets while in other situations he has the physical resiliency to stand toe to toe with superman survive unprotected in deep space and withstand high level destructive weaponry and powerful explosive blasts without sustaining injury he has displayed particular susceptibility to gaseous chemicals in one instance lobo was declared immortal after he died and went to hell he proved too much for the demons and when he was then sent to heaven he wreaked so much havoc that he was permanently banished from the afterlife if lobo sustains injury his accelerated healing factor enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with superhuman speed and efficiency and little apparent pain lobo also is functionally immortal he is immune to the effects of aging and disease as such even though he can sustain sufficient injury to be out of commission for quite some time he will apparently heal from any injury given sufficient time for instance lobo can regenerate out of a pool of his own blood apparently recycling the cells 18 at one time lobo could grow a copy of himself possessing all of his skills and powers out of every drop of his blood that was spilled this power was removed by vril dox during lobo s time with l e g i o n but lobo regained it in the series young justice in which he was de aged by klarion the witch boy and slaughtered while on a mission to apokolips his blood reformed into thousands of lobo clones who waged war on the planet and then proceeded to murder each other until only one lobo the current one was left one of his other clones slobo survived but later began to fall apart until being dealt with by darkseid in 52 he again regenerated from a pool of blood but no clones were created so he no longer appears to retain this ability lobo possesses an amazingly developed sense of smell which allows him to track objects between solar systems as well as a separate tracking ability enabling him to track an individual across galactic distances he is a formidable combatant with expertise in multiple forms of armed and unarmed combat his favorite weapon is a large titanium alloy chain with a large gutting hook connected at the end often referred to as the garrote that he keeps wrapped around his right wrist at times he also uses high grade explosives and advanced firearms despite his violent and loutish nature lobo seems to have a genius level intellect in matters of destruction and violence he can create complex virulent agents and the corresponding antidotes in one version of his backstory he released such a plague on czarnia as a school science project this resulted in the deaths of the entire population in the span of one week he then proceeded to give himself an a lobo has extraordinary speed rivaling the flash lobo was blessed with the power of detecting weaknesses in any enemy just by looking at it his vehicle some sort of space faring motorcycle the space hog often accompanies him it is of his own design and despite its size it is capable of extended and speedy travel throughout space further it protects those in its immediate vicinity from the hazards of space and somehow permits the ability to breathe and speak he was also able to scavenge parts from a destroyed time hopper and attach them to his own bike producing a working time machine lobo is fluent in many alien languages
