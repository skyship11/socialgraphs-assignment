dc s 1974 1976 series the sandman written by joe simon and michael fleisher and illustrated by jack kirby and ernie chua gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series gaiman mentioned his treatment in passing to dc editor karen berger 4 when months later berger offered gaiman a comic title to work on he was unsure his sandman pitch would be accepted weeks later berger asked gaiman if he was interested in doing a sandman series gaiman recalled i said um yes yes definitely what s the catch berger said there s only one we d like a new sandman keep the name but the rest is up to you 4 gaiman crafted the new character from an initial image of a man young pale and naked imprisoned in a tiny cell waiting until his captors passed away deathly thin with long dark hair and strange eyes 5 gaiman patterned the character s black attire on a print of a japanese kimono as well as his own wardrobe 6 characteristics edit appearance edit dream usually appears as a tall thin man with bone white skin black hair and two stars in place of eyes most often they are silver blue or white but when he becomes angered they have been shown to turn red dream s appearance ranges widely people generally perceive him in a style of dress appropriate to their region and era in the dreaming he is often seen wearing a grey t shirt and dark pants he appears to be light skinned when interacting with similar characters but the people of tales in the sand s primordial african city see him as dark he appears as a huge black cat when speaking to the lonely cat pilgrim of dream of a thousand cats and as a cat headed god when addressing the egyptian feline goddess bast the martian manhunter sees dream in the shape of a flaming martian skull and identifies him as lord l zoril but mister miracle looking at him simultaneously sees him as a man in season of mists he appears in the same form to all the gods bast comments i much prefer you in cat form dream old friend 7 in the dream hunters set in ancient japan dream appears as a japanese man to a buddhist monk and as a fox to a fox spirit he customarily wears a billowing black cape sometimes with a flame motif in battle he wears a helmet made from the skull and backbone of a defeated enemy this helm which resembles a world war ii era gas mask is also his sigil in the galleries of the other endless as well as appearing in the dreams and at least once on the staircase wall of wesley dodds his face and physique are based on an amalgamation of neil gaiman in his twenties the cure s frontman robert smith and ballet dancer farukh ruzimatov 8 9 dream s face and appearance are also based on bauhaus frontman peter murphy 10 11 in fact gaiman explained that murphy was the original model for dream 12 gaiman also stated that sandman artist dave mckean based dream s face in the cover of sandman 1 on peter murphy 13 14 speech edit dream s speech is usually portrayed as white text in black wavy edged speech bubbles bordered in white the text is capitalized normally sentence case in stark contrast to other characters speech generally in block caps text personality edit although he is ultimately a heroic character dream is sometimes slow to understand humor occasionally insensitive often self obsessed and very slow to forgive a slight he has a long history of failed amours and is both shown and implied to have reacted harshly to the women therein both his mother night and his siblings have commented that dream has always wanted and always failed at finding a partner as mervyn pumpkinhead remarks he s gotta be the tragic figure standing out in the rain mournin the loss of his beloved so down comes the rain right on cue in the meantime everybody gets dreams full of existential angst and wakes up feeling like hell and we all get wet near the end of the brief lives story arc desire says of dream he s stuffy stupid and thinks he knows everything and there s just something about him that gets on my nerves there is a long standing enmity between dream and desire stemming from desire s possible involvement in the failure of one of dream s amours seen in endless nights it is implied that before his imprisonment he was crueler and more blind to his flaws and much of the sandman is focused on his desire to atone for his past behavior e g helping past lovers calliope and nada dream reacts strongly to perceived insult he banishes nada to hell for rejecting him and expresses outrage when hob gadling suggests that he seeks companionship dream is constantly aware of his responsibilities both to other people and to his territory and is detailed and exacting in their fulfillment as noted in season of mists where he is described thus of all the endless save perhaps destiny he is most conscious of his responsibilities the most meticulous in their execution conversely he also uses his responsibilities as an excuse to avoid change and other things he does not want to do he shares a close reciprocal bond of dependence and trust with his elder sister death he consistently strives for understanding of himself and of the other endless but is ultimately defeated by his inability to accept change in the wake when asked by matthew the raven why did it happen why did he let it happen lucien remarks charitably i think sometimes perhaps one must change or die and in the end there were perhaps limits to how much he could let himself change however death suspects dream allowed himself to become vulnerable to the kindly ones by leaving his realm when summoned by a fairy this would imply dream accepted change enough to knowingly and willingly allow himself to be killed and reborn as another aspect of himself a different one one might argue however that this whole die and be replaced by the daniel version of himself plot was just dream playing his own role as he already knew some of it would happen when he met the daniel dream and retrieved the saeculum both events happening in the sandman overture thus the change was maybe never an option but an imperative dream is noted in season of mists as accumulating names to himself as others make friends but he permits himself few friends he is given more names in the sandman than any of the other endless beyond the many translations of dream despite his narcissism and pride dream has a strong sense of honor he repeatedly risks his life to make amends for a past wrong despite not needing to do so though this was only after death pointed out how horribly he had behaved and continues on his search with delirium despite his aversion to doing so feeling it was unjust their human guide died without knowing anything of their quest the dreaming edit dream lives in a castle at the heart of his realm the dreaming both the castle and the rest of his realm are mutable and change often often at his will although his resistance to change and difficulty changing is a theme throughout the series dream maintains both the castle and the realm as with all aspects of his appearance in a half accommodating half terrifying state simultaneously acknowledging both the courtesy due to others and the attention due him as the realm s master and indeed the pleasantness and terror of dreams themselves dream is the only one of the endless known to populate his realm with speaking characters a multitude of dreams and nightmares he has created as well as entities from other realms these include the narrators from older dc horror comics including cain and abel and fiddler s green who emulates g k chesterton in human form dream recruits or creates or re creates servants to perform roles he could easily carry out himself including the reorganization of the castle and the guarding of its entrance although this is not stated in the series gaiman has said that he always assumed dream had once been alone in the dreaming and that he populated it for want of company 15 other than dream himself the most important inhabitant of the dreaming is lucien the first of dream s ravens and now the librarian of the dreaming dream gives lucien authority over the dreaming on several occasions the character originally appeared in the 1970s dc comic tales of ghost castle which lasted for only three issues and was apparently killed off in secrets of haunted house 44 16 lucien and cain have a similar appearance as both were originally created by the same artist 17 other notable inhabitants include a pumpkin headed scarecrow named mervyn who assists with the physical maintenance of the dreaming a faery named nuala who has unrequited affections for dream and who plays an unwitting part in his downfall a raven named matthew who travels through the waking world on errands for dream usually as a scout or spy matthew was formerly a mortal man matthew cable and a character in dc comics swamp thing who died in the dreaming gaiman used matthew as a way to explain some background information to the readers 17 the dreaming is at any moment also full of all creatures dreaming at that moment although these seldom appear in the comics panel several comics in dc s vertigo line have
