series incarnation of brother blood producer writer david slack said in the end we tried to make him the anti slade where slade hides in the shadows brother blood loves the spotlight slade always has some ulterior motive brother blood will tell you what he s planning right away so there s some contrast there we weren t even sure we d get to use that name i think what was important that we kept was that he was the leader of a cult we kept that role and drew inspiration from cult leaders we read about they are very charming seeming people from that we gave him this sort of power of temptation this ability to control people s perceptions and the power of persuasion we didn t get too deep into the character from the comics because so much of it was so outside of what we d be able to do he s definitely one where we ve strayed more 19 brother blood is a recurring villain in teen titans go voiced again by john dimaggio he is introduced in the episode waffles alongside his creation a torture
