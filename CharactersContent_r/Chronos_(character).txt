the walker gabriel version of chronos first appeared in chronos 1 and was created by john francis moore and paul guinan fictional character biography edit david clinton edit the archenemy of the atom ray palmer chronos started his career as petty thief david clinton who attributed his consistent incarceration to his timing or lack thereof to improve his timing he studied the rhythm of time pieces and by practice he learned to synchronize each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock by the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his criminal career he then adopted the colorful costume and alter ego of chronos the time thief clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of gimmick weapons and deathtraps based on time pieces clocks with blades as hands flying sun dials he liked to give time related puns such as time is golden when spraying golden gas at green lantern 4 chronos made his debut in ivy town but was defeated by the atom when he tried to steal an atomic clock because of an idea ironically given to him by ray palmer he came close to deducing the atom s secret identity when he realized the atom attacked him soon after ray saw him and succeeded in capturing the atom and placing him inside a watch the atom escaped the watch while chronos was breaking into a vault and used a trick to make him think he was wrong however he escaped from jail by adapting a guard s watch making the ticks so loud they broke open his cell door he next tried to steal a collection of historic hungarian clocks which each had a gem hidden inside but was again defeated the atom has since thwarted all of chronos plans each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in chronos weaponry his study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions lenses that prevent people from seeing certain events e g his getaway vehicle or another specific object circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time an hourglass of concentrated time that could speed points up briefly and even make bricks next to a bank vault crumble in a few seconds and ultimately a fully functional time machine before it and the designs were destroyed one story suggests that chronos may have been receiving help from a future version of himself but it is unknown at what relative time frame that chronos came from another story published in world s finest comics 321 1985 suggests that chronos made the transition from a mere thief with a time gimmick to a full fledged time traveler after becoming acquainted with the mysterious dr fox perhaps named after gardner fox a criminal scientist who had never been apprehended and who was described by chronos as the greatest mind since einstein pre crisis chronos was a member of the crime champions a trio of earth 1 villains who teamed up with a trio of earth 2 villains to commit robberies then escape to the other world using a vibratory device the fiddler accidentally discovered chronos is able to escape wonder woman batman and green lantern after stealing a million dollars from the powers city bank when the earth 2 crime champions impersonate the earth 1 crime champions the icicle impersonates chronos with the help of the wizard s tibetan magic and fought batman wonder woman and green lantern making them touch rubber animal and glass as part of a spell to trap the jla on earth 2 chronos tries to steal a rare clock from a lighthouse and uses his vibratory watch to put aquaman into a coma but superman is able to revive aquaman and captures chronos crushing his watch the jla and jsa are captured again and magically placed in cages in space but with the aid of the green lanterns escape and return to earth chronos tries to help the fiddler find an earth 3 with his chronological knowledge but is defeated by the martian manhunter and black canary chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time research the atom had always thwarted chronos but he had decided to turn his back on humanity and had retreated to a peaceful seclusion with a group of six inch tall aliens in the amazonian jungle chronos had more success without the atom but he brought himself to the attention of the blue beetle when he tried to blackmail one of the employees of kord inc 5 he also fought the beetle during darkseid s anti hero riots during one struggle against the beetle chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time lost captain atom he later met a time traveling superman who chronos manipulated into helping him get home upon his return to the present chronos was able to use his technology to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune chronos s illegal endeavors were discovered and he was returned to prison he was freed by the calendar man to work with the time foes but was captured by the teen titans out of desperation and humiliation chronos took a drastic chance he accepted an offer from the demon neron and exchanged his soul for the metahuman ability to manipulate time those bargains with neron are never fair and chronos found that each journey through the timestream accelerated his aging a man who should have been a healthy adult became an aged senior citizen clinton s efforts to bypass this flaw passing his artificial age onto youths with a special glove of his own creation and intercepting other time travelers in an attempt to acquire their technology brought him briefly into conflict with the legion of super heroes in a somewhat confusing and often non linear sequence of events all the experiments and neron s gift had taken a toll on clinton s body and he began to lose touch with any sense of the now he had trouble staying localized in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness his disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into the void of time a funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second chronos walker gabriel time travel being what it is david clinton s legal death has not meant the end of his presence in the dc universe he has made several appearances since such as during the identity crisis when he claimed to have traveled forward from a point in time shortly before his final disappearance this foreknowledge of his own suspected demise led to a somewhat subdued even morose demeanor in the all new atom 12 the wacky anagram guy that has been testing and helping ryan choi the new atom is none other than chronos himself in issue 20 he is revealed as the mastermind behind all of the strange occurrences surrounding ivy town since the start of the series his vengeful goal is to destroy everything that ray palmer loved 4 he s able to do so by joining forces with lady chronos a new companion

correspondence and epistolary friendship between ryan and ray palmer spurring ryan to follow in palmer s footsteps only to disgrace him in the eyes of ivy town shaming the atom s legacy forever with
