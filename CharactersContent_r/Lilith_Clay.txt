the character was originally intended to be raven but an embargo was placed upon the cast of the new teen titans appearing in the title by editorial as such lilith was substituted as the secret identity of omen in teen titans vol 2 12 15 omen is unmasked as lilith after being captured by the super villain haze during the story lilith summons both the founding titans save donna troy who was imprisoned by dark angel at the time and the jurgens titans to rescue her the original titans recognized haze as a villain they fought once before in the past but when haze unmasked omen before the
