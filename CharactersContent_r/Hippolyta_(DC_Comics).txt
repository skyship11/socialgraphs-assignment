hippolyte and the amazons once resided in amazonia in the days of ancient greece until they were beguiled and bested by the demi god hercules who had been inspired by the god of war mars to go after her she was able to beat him thanks to the magic girdle but he seduced her and tricked her into removing the girdle allowing him to steal it this caused the amazons to lose their super strength and the favor of their patron goddess aphrodite eventually she and the other amazons were forgiven but had to wear bracelets to remind them of the folly of submitting to men to regain their status the amazons were decreed to leave the mortal world and relocate to paradise island there they established their own society free from the evils of man s world so long as they remained there and hippolyte retained possession of her magic girdle the amazons would be immortal much of this history was adapted varied and expanded upon in the modern version of the wonder woman comics 2 for the most part hippolyte remained on paradise island during the golden age era rarely interacting with the modern world to which her daughter had journeyed her role was that of the amazon queen and mentor to wonder woman she was devoted to the olympian goddesses particularly the amazons patron aphrodite and was adamant that man never be allowed to set foot on paradise island although she remained mainly on the island in one story from sensation comics 26 reprinted in wonder woman the complete history hippolyte travels to man s world and briefly assumes the role of wonder woman 3 in the first appearance of villany inc she is kidnapped to lure wonder woman into a trap in the late 1950s dc comics introduced the concept of the multiverse and the golden age hippolyte was established as existing on the world known as earth two the last appearance of this incarnation of hippolyte was in wonder woman vol 1 97 in april 1958 after which the focus shifted from earth two to the more modern versions of the characters on earth one silver and bronze ages edit the silver and bronze age hippolyta was depicted as blonde from wonder woman vol 1 105 april 1959 as of wonder woman vol 1 98 may 1958 the amazon queen s name was spelled hippolyta and she was depicted with blonde hair and a triple pointed tiara the backstory of this silver age hippolyta was largely identical to the golden age version with some exceptions for example it was established in a 1973 storyline that hippolyta had crafted a second daughter from clay a dark skinned amazon named nubia who was to be wonder woman s sister before she was spirited away by the god mars 4 hippolyta was also the adoptive mother of donna troy who had been rescued from a fire and brought to paradise island as before hippolyta s role in the silver age era was primarily that of paradise island s queen and mentor to wonder woman she was frequently shown interacting with her daughter as well as supporting characters of the era such as wonder girl and wonder tot according to the dc comics 1976 calendar hippolyta was born on january 8 hippolyta was also instrumental in several of the continuity shake ups for the earth one wonder woman enraged that her daughter recovering from amnesia had submitted to trials by the justice league to prove her worth to rejoin she created her own test which involved resurrecting steve trevor to lead an assault on paradise island the goddess aphrodite granted diana s wish to allow the resurrected trevor to continue living although he was later revealed to be eros animating trevor s body after trevor had again been killed and a grief stricken diana returned home hippolyta erased diana s memories of him when a trevor from a parallel universe burst through the barriers between worlds and crashed off paradise island hippolyta asked aphrodite to alter the memories of the entire world to allow the new trevor to embark upon a life on earth one in 1985 the crisis on infinite earths miniseries revised dc comics continuity and combined the multiple earths into one world the modern version of hippolyta would combine elements of her earlier incarnations and take on greater importance in the series modern age edit hippolyta as she appears from the 1987 reboot until 2011 s the new 52 art by phil jimenez 2002 origin edit hippolyta s origins underwent a revision after writer george p√©rez revamp of wonder woman in 1987 in that continuity hippolyta and the rest of the themyscirian amazons were created by a select group of the olympian goddesses which included artemis athena hestia demeter and aphrodite these goddesses reincarnated the souls of women gathered by the earth goddess gaea women who had been slain by man s ignorance and fear they sent these souls hippolyta s original incarnation was a pregnant cavewoman slain circa 32 000 bce to the bottom of the aegean sea the souls then began to merge with the clay on the seabed the first reincarnated amazon to break the surface was hippolyta and thus she was titled as queen of the new race in this version hippolyta stood 5 9 weighed approximately 130 lbs had curly black hair and more the second amazon to break the surface was her sister antiope and she ruled at hippolyta s side each of the goddesses then blessed the amazon nation with gifts hunting skills and superhuman abilities such as superhuman strength speed durability enhanced senses healing factor and agility artemis wisdom athena warm homes hestia plentiful harvests demeter and beauty inside and out aphrodite as a symbol of their responsibilities the goddesses gave hippolyta and antiope each a golden girdle of gaea the amazons eventually founded the city of themyscira in anatolia and became known as fierce warriors of peace in turkey greece and rome heracles edit the jealous and vengeful god ares tried to drive a wedge between amazons and other civilizations by influencing his half brother the demi god heracles to challenge the amazons when heracles first approached the amazons seeking battle hippolyta met him outside the city gates and tried to employ peaceful negotiations when this did not work heracles attacked the amazon queen hippolyta easily turned the tables on him by using her wisdom and battle skills to subdue him still wishing peace hippolyta invited heracles and his men into their city to celebrate a potential friendship with a feast heracles seemingly accepted the invitation once in their city heracles and his men drugged the amazons wine and took them prisoner after the theft of hippolyta s golden girdle and abuse and rape of the amazons hippolyta cried out to athena to help them escape their bonds athena said that she would only aid them on the condition that the amazons not seek retribution against heracles and his men as that would be beneath the ideals of the amazons hippolyta agreed and her bonds were broken hippolyta freed the other amazons the amazons however were filled with hate and the desire for revenge breaking hippolyta s oath to athena the amazons began slaughtering their captors heracles and his general theseus had left after they had killed all the men keeping them prisoners antiope renounced all ties to the olympian gods and said goodbye to her sister hippolyta giving hippolyta her golden girdle of gaea to replace the one stolen by heracles she left to pursue vengeance intending to kill heracles and theseus antiope s tribe later became the amazons of bana mighdall godly penance edit hippolyta and the remaining faithful amazons then went to the sea shore where athena told them their punishment for betraying their ideals they were to be given immortality so that they could forever safeguard a doorway to a place of unspeakable evil the doorway was on a far off isolated island and it took months to get there to guide their way the god poseidon cleared a pathway for them across the seas once they arrived the amazons created a new city and named their new home themyscira after their previous fallen city the amazons continued to live on the island guarding this doom s doorway later shown to also lead to other places such as parts of hades and paying homage to their gods for three thousand years diana s birth edit hippolyta began to ache for something unknown she was told by the oracle menalippe that the yearning she felt was for her unborn daughter she was instructed to go to the beach and form a figure of an infant out of the island s clay the original five goddesses plus hermes united to incarnate and bless this final soul they imbued it with many gifts and merged it with the clay form and just as with the previous amazons the clay was changed into flesh and blood hippolyta named the child diana after a great and holy warrior a stranger who had washed ashore on the island and died helping the amazons defeat cottus a creature escaping doom s doorway this diana was later revealed to be the mother of steve trevor who as a pilot had crashed near the island in the 1940s return of heracles edit during diana s challenge of the gods storyline 5 6 7 she discovered that heracles was transformed into a colossal stone pillar within doom s doorway and was supporting themyscira s weight for several millennia 6 in this state he was tormented and scarred by various mythological creatures feeling the pain inflicted by them but not being able to do anything about it much like prometheus 7 this was the punishment given to him for his past transgressions thanks to diana hippolyta and the lasso of truth he was restored to his original form and begged the amazons for forgiveness though some of the amazons still harbored anger for their past humiliation most of them were moved by heracles newfound humility and queen hippolyta asked her people to search their hearts for the strength to forgive which they almost immediately did doing so herself hippolyta not only forgave heracles but shared a brief kiss with him before he left the mortal realm to return to his father in olympus 8 return to the outside world edit after diana s completion of her challenge the amazons were released from their punishment by the olympian gods they were free to live out their lives any way they saw fit while retaining their immortality 8 to celebrate hippolyta declared that themyscira would finally create cultural exchange with the outside world diana became themyscira s ambassador to the u n 9 10 in spreading the amazon ideals of love and peace diana made a powerful enemy the sorceress circe 11 one of circe s attacks on diana involved the brainwashing of hippolyta transforming her into the second shim tar or chief warrior of the amazons of bana mighdall 12 13 in this persona hippolyta attacked diana and was defeated by a ricochet from diana s bracelets circe considered all amazons to be her enemy and later made a new plan for revenge she teleported the amazons of bana mighdall to themyscira on the pretense that they were to take the island while the two groups fought circe teleported the island to a dimension of demons there the two groups of amazons were forced to put aside their rivalry in order to stave off the demons attacks the amazons remained in the demon dimension until diana discovered what had happened and forced circe to return the island back to its rightful dimension 14 they found upon their return that although their time in the demon dimension lasted several years the time passed in our dimension was only a few months 15 in this time the themyscirian and bana mighdallian amazons made an uneasy truce the themyscirians would live in the city while the bana mighdallians would form their own settlement on the opposite side of the island in hippolyta s mind she still served as queen over all amazons on the island but the bana mighdallian amazons did not see it as such and tensions between the two tribes remained 16 motherly deception edit because the demon dimension they were in was magic based hippolyta began to receive dreams and visions of the future in one such dream she foresaw wonder woman s death fearful for her daughter s welfare she put into motion a plan to remove diana from her role as wonder woman and transfer the title of themyscira s champion to another amazon thus a new contest for the title was made though she kept her true reasons for calling the new contest to herself alone initially hippolyta thought the amazons of bana mighdall were not worthy to enter the contest but when diana angered at her mother s treatment of the new amazons called a vote on the whole to see if her people also agreed that they should be allowed to participate the answer was yes suddenly inspired hippolyta noticed that the bana mighdallian s most likely warrior to win was the amazon artemis hippolyta then in secret went to the themyscirian amazon mystic magala she had magala transfer half of diana s gods given powers over to artemis in order for artemis victory to be better equipped 17 hippolyta also provided many additional obstacles for diana to encounter during her contest trials in order for her to become sidetracked from the goal of winning due to her actions artemis became the contest s winner and the new champion wonder woman later when diana began to receive visions of the past she confronted her mother on why she really called for a new contest when hippolyta told her her and diana s relationship became scarred as diana never truly forgave her mother for knowingly sending another amazon to her death 18 wonder woman edit after artemis was killed in battle the title of wonder woman was returned to diana this sent hippolyta into a deep depression as she realized she was the cause of an innocent s death hippolyta gave command to the amazon general philippus and went into self imposed banishment 19 hippolyta boarded a small boat and let it cast adrift she eventually landed in louisiana where she met a psychic named angela 20 21 22 after becoming friends with angela and her family angela informed hippolyta that her daughter was in serious danger 23 rushing to her aid hippolyta arrived too late to save diana from the demon neron as diana was still suffering from the spell that had reduced her strength 17 thus hippolyta s vision of her daughter dying as wonder woman came true 24 hippolyta as wonder woman from wonder woman vol 2 130 feb 1998 art by john byrne and patricia mulvihill diana after her death was granted divinity as the goddess of truth by her gods for such faithful devotion 25 during her brief time as a god of olympus diana was replaced in the role of wonder woman by her mother 26 as opposed to diana receiving the title in honor hippolyta s role as wonder woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in artemis death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter 27 however hippolyta eventually grew to enjoy the freedom and adventure the title came with whereas diana used the lasso of truth as her primary weapon hippolyta favored a broadsword and wore a short blue skirt instead of briefs john byrne the writer that introduced the concept of hippolyta as the first wonder woman has explained his intentions in a post in his message board i thought george s one mistake in rebooting wonder woman was making her only 25 years old when she left paradise island i preferred the idea of a diana who was thousands of years old as if i recall correctly she was in the tv series from that angle i would have liked to have seen diana having been wonder woman in ww2 and be returning to our world in the reboot not having that option i took the next best course and had hippolyta fill that role 28 as wonder woman queen hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with jay garrick 29 after this mission she elected to join the justice society of america and remained in that era for eight years where her teammates nicknamed her polly during that time she had a relationship with ted grant 30 hippolyta also made visits into the past to see her godchild lyta daughter of hippolyta s protege helena the golden age fury volume issue needed these visits happened yearly from young lyta s perspective and also accounted for hippolyta s participation in the jsa jla team ups when she returned from the past hippolyta took diana s place in the jla as well 31 32 eventually diana gave up her godhood and returned to her role as wonder woman 33 still clinging to her newfound sense of freedom hippolyta did not wish to relinquish her title as wonder woman even though she admitted her daughter looked better in a bathing suit than she did leaving two different wonder women acting in the same role at the same time diana was often unhappy with hippolyta s continued role as wonder woman as she felt hippolyta was ignoring her true duties as ruler of themyscira thus further inciting the antagonism between mother and daughter 34 around this time hippolyta discovered that the hero donna troy was actually a mirror image of her daughter diana brought to life through themyscirian sorceries though hippolyta had met donna on previous adventures when the two women met again after learning this fact hippolyta accepted donna as a second daughter and held a coronation on the island proclaiming donna to be the second amazon princess and an heir to the themyscirian throne 35 on one visit to the island diana discovered that the two tribes of amazons were on the verge of a civil war due to unresolved issues and mysterious acts of sabotage made on the bana mighdallian s construction of their city when both diana and donna confronted hippolyta about her inaction of rule at such a dangerous time hippolyta became very upset with her two daughters and told them that she intended to continue her role as wonder woman in the outside world and that diana and donna were to rule the island in her absence unfortunately the civil war took place after all and many amazons on both sides were killed returning to the island hippolyta and diana agreed to denounce their royal titles in order for both amazon tribes to have an opportunity for peace having both tribes gain equal footing in united rule 36 16 death edit hippolyta continued to establish a distinguished career as wonder woman the queen enjoyed her role in the justice society and became accustomed to life in the united states mother and daughter fought on several occasions over hippolyta s past expected roles hero or queen and their differences were unresolved when the queen sacrificed herself to save the earth from imperiex during the imperiex war featured in our worlds at war 37 ironically hippolyta died at the birthplace of the amazons near the aegean sea in greece however she was allowed to see her daughter one last time and say goodbye she the spirit of her sister antiope and steve trevor s mother diana rockwell trevor became ghostly guardians of the island watching over both tribes as their distant and former queens 38 one year later edit as part of the amazons attack storyline the witch circe revived hippolyta and showed her that the u s government illegally kidnapped her daughter diana 39 she was being tortured until she gave over the plans on how the u s government could create their own purple ray to be used as a weapon 40 angered over this hippolyta resumed leadership of the amazons and had them attack the city of washington d c in the hopes of rescuing diana and serving their own form of justice against the world for their actions they are shown using winged steeds and other mythical creatures during battle hippolyta discovered that circe had secretly planned to detonate a nuclear weapon on themyscira and gained her revenge on the traitor by impaling the sorceress with a battle spear through the chest wonder woman has an opportunity to kill her mother but does not take it instead giving the knife to hippolyta who will not kill her daughter despite the fact that circe is supposedly dead hippolyta seems fully intent on continuing her assault on the united states even issuing an attack on other locations including kansas her more chaotic and malicious actions start to concern her amazon generals it is later learned that circe used a portion of her own soul to revive hippolyta from death because of this hippolyta s persona was tainted by the witch s evil and thus hippolyta is now a more blood thirsty being than before 41 at the conclusion of the war all of the amazons are given false identities and scattered throughout the world 42 43 hippolyta is spared but is banished to live alone on themyscira by what appears to be athena but is later revealed to be the villainous granny goodness who along with the other new gods of apokolips have imprisoned the greek deities in countdown to final crisis hippolyta lives in hiding from granny goodness and her new brand of amazons human recruits being trained as a new generation of her female furies with the help of island castaways holly robinson briefly known as catwoman harley quinn and a powerless mary marvel hippolyta is able to drive granny out of thermiscyra and back to apokolips after the greek gods are freed by mary granny is murdered by the mysterious godkiller leaving hippolyta once more as the queen of themyscira the circle edit during her isolation hippolyta travels to the four corners of themyscira speaking to an amazon prisoner at each point asking them if they repent to which each prisoner replies never however the fourth and last prisoner whom hippolyta identifies as alkyone presents her with a wooden tiara with the words our queen across it similar to the one she and diana both wore as wonder woman alkyone tells hippolyta since she denied her the use of any blades she gnawed in the inscription with her teeth she goes on to accuse hippolyta of betrayal for birthing the dragon which clearly is a reference to diana alkyone begs her to kill diana and let them be a tribe again but hippolyta adamantly refuses alkyone then tells hippolyta to tell diana the truth but again hippolyta refuses and breaks the wooden tiara in half as she leaves alkyone vows to save hippolyta and make them a tribe again by killing diana 44 alkyone s past reveals her to have been a member of hippolyta s royal guard along with three other amazons myrto charis and philomela charged with her personal protection 45 they were viewed as too brutal minded and overzealous by general philippus captain of the general amazon guard a viewpoint that was later proven when alkyone learned that hippolyta desired a child this came to a head when alkyone learned from the amazon sorceress magala that another amazon named gennes had supposedly given birth to a daughter but it turned out the baby was nothing more than a clay doll carved in the image of a child concluding gennes had gone mad alkyone ordered that no such dolls were ever to be crafted on themyscira again after that she ordered gennes to be killed in the present day the army of captain nazi lands on themyscira intending to claim it for themselves alerted to their arrival hippolyta cuts her hair and readies herself for battle and vows to redeem herself for all the mistakes she has made since her resurrection elsewhere on the island alkyone offers her help and the rest of the former royal guard to the soldiers in hunting down hippolyta in exchange for their release wonder woman the movie edit in wonder woman issues 24 and 25 there is a movie being made about diana in the beginning of issue 24 diana brings thomas andrew tresser home to meet her mother queen hippolyta hippolyta takes tresser and leaves diana alone on the beach this is her opportunity to get to know the man in whom her daughter has become interested the getting to know him phase includes taking tom to the royal menagerie to hand feed griffins of myth while there hippolyta asks rather directly if he and diana have made love yet flustered he is able to honestly answer that they haven t she asks tom will you protect her keep her from harm if you are able he replies yes that i can promise although it usually goes the other way round to be blunt before he leaves she gives him a spear she has made grants him the title sir thomas of cleveland and makes him a guardsman of themyscira as diana and tom prepare to leave she requests one thing of her new guardsman babies as many as he and diana can create as quickly as they can create them as they leave the island alkyone is seen watching them from shore as they float away on a giant shell 46 past imperfect edit following the events of wonder woman 600 the timeline is altered by the greek gods and hippolyta s history is radically changed once again here themyscira is invaded by a heavily armed paramilitary group while diana is still a child and the majority of the amazons are wiped out in the ensuing battle hippolyta is able to save diana by entrusting her to several of her servants who smuggle the child to the united states in the midst of the attack but hippolyta herself is ultimately captured by the enemy soldiers after being bound and presented to the leader of the invaders hippolyta commits suicide by throwing herself into a massive fire being used to incinerate the dead amazons choosing to die rather than submit to her captors 47 after wonder woman s exile in the altered continuity is reversed hippolyta is briefly restored to her modern age origins 48 greeting her daughter back and approving the changes she had done to her attitude and appearance during her ordeal the new 52 edit new 52 version of hippolyta from wonder woman vol 4 2 december 2011 art by cliff chiang in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline hippolyta receives another major change now looking like the silver age hippolyta youthful and blonde she retains her warrior woman attitude furthermore this incarnation of hippolyta didn t fashion diana from clay instead she bore her daughter from a relationship with zeus concocting a lie to protect diana from hera s rage 49 after the truth about diana s birth is revealed hera the queen of the greek gods appears on paradise island to punish hippolyta not for having an affair with her husband but for having been too weak to resist zeus seduction hippolyta had predicted this and asks hera to take her life in exchange of letting diana live however hera changes her mind at the last second and instead of killing hippolyta turns her into stone and the rest of the amazons minus diana into snakes thus destroying wonder woman s home and her only family 50 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 hippolyta once again goes through a major change in the year one storyline hippolyta is presented like the golden age version with black hair and has a peaceful demeanor when steve trevor lands on the island and is the only survivor of the soldiers she seeks to have him sent home safely by hosting a competition to determine which amazon is worthy she quickly realizes her daughter will be the one to win something that saddens her since leaving the island forsakes an amazon s right to return however she is nevertheless proud when diana does indeed win and they bid each other goodbye in the story arc the lies wonder woman and steve seemingly return to themyscira to find hippolyta the new 52 one and the amazons safe and sound despite wonder woman remembering her apparent demise hippolyta does not understand what she means and only seems suspicious of steve telling diana not to let him wander around alone however diana and steve begin to notice the inconsistencies the amazons are not familiar they speak english instead of their ancient language and their architecture has changed diana realizes this is because what she thought to be true was a lie she never returned to themyscira when she left years before so the new 52 hippolyta was an illusion in the present day hippolyta and the amazons take notice of a strange tree growing on the island that serves as a bad omen of events to come any attempts to cut down the tree are futile and hippolyta worries diana is in danger she and her fellow amazons go to
