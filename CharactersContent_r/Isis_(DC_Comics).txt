external links fictional character biography edit andrea thomas and saturday morning television series edit joanna cameron as isis in the secrets of isis like the main character of the first half of the program captain marvel isis had roots in ancient egyptian mythology the television series the secrets of isis starred joanna cameron as andrea thomas a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the goddess isis after finding an egyptian amulet during an archeological dig in egypt as revealed during the show s opening title sequence fifteen episodes of the secrets of isis were produced for the shazam isis hour and the character also appeared in three episodes of the shazam portion of the show the secrets of isis was given its own timeslot in 1977 for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons isis later appeared in animated form on filmation s tarzan and the super 7 show in 1980 as part of a segment called the freedom force she later guest starred on the kid super power hour with shazam s hero high segment though cameron did not voice the character citation needed powers and abilities edit isis demonstrated numerous powers that manifested when the need arose these included flight super speed super strength to a level comparable to superman and wonder woman telekinesis the ability to move and levitate objects geokinesis the ability to control elements such as fire earth wind and water the ability to change the molecules of inanimate objects to allow people to pass through them the ability to act as a human lightning rod remote viewing and at her power s maximum the ability to stop and reverse time to activate these powers isis usually is shown reciting a rhyming chant the most frequent being oh zephyr winds that blow on high lift me now so i can fly the medallion andrea thomas uses to change into isis also gives her apparent limited powers even when in her non isis form as she is shown communicating telepathically with her pet crow tut and engaging in minor mind control even without changing she also received superior hand to hand and weapons combat skills from the goddess love interests edit andrea isis love interest is fellow teacher rick mason although this relationship is more implied than explicitly stated the two characters are simply shown in many episodes enjoying each other s company going on picnics horseback riding and going for dinner together as in the classic lois lane example mason remains oblivious to the physical similarities between andrea and isis beyond some idle speculation in early episodes in one episode the seeing eye horse a blind character realizes that isis and andrea have almost identical voices but otherwise the series never explored the secret identity dilemma in any serious way during the abbreviated second season cosmetic changes were made to the isis character in terms of makeup and hairstyle first appearance in comics edit isis first appearance in comics was in shazam 25 september october 1976 she was later given her own tv tie in book the following month titled the mighty isis which ran for two years out surviving the tv series the eight issue run by dc comics began in october 1976 and ended in january 1978 early issues featured a special dc tv logo all stories starred the andrea thomas character from the television series the book was edited by denny o neil written by jack c harris and most issues illustrated by mike vosburg the first issue was illustrated by ric estrada and wallace wood although early issues stayed within the format of the tv series later issues covered storylines beyond the scope of the show such as a story arc involving andrea abandoning her human alter ego and cutting ties with her friends and family resulting in rick mason revealing his love for her like other dc characters who have been reimagined this version of isis though not mentioned or appearing in crisis on infinite earths can be assumed to have been retconned out of existence following the 1985 dc miniseries as a goddess within the dc universe edit in january 2002 dc comics re introduced the goddess isis as one of the chief gods worshipped by the bana mighdallian amazons in the wonder woman comic although the bana tribe was introduced in 1989 their gods were not shown until 2002 her introduction depicted her in a standard white sleeveless gown and egyptian headdress containing her trademark symbol later the various amazon gods were depicted as selecting more modern appearances for themselves after this isis was then shown as wearing a black business suit with skirt long straight black hair and a neck choker containing an ankh adrianna tomaz edit 52 edit main article 52 comics the superhero isis was re introduced in the dc universe in the weekly comic book 52 in issue 3 may 2006 1 in this series an egyptian woman named adrianna tomaz an homage to the andrea thomas character on the television program is a refugee who is enslaved and brought to black adam as a gift from intergang along with 2 000 000 in gold upon freeing her and killing the emissaries who had brought her to him black adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better after weeks of discussion during which adrianna changed the way adam looked at the world and inspired him to commit kinder acts adam retrieved the magical amulet of isis from the tomb of his wife and children and asked captain marvel now the keeper of the rock of eternity to confer its power on adrianna the amulet of isis had long ago belonged to another of the wizard shazam s champions queen pharaoh hatshepsut of the 18th dynasty who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom upon hatshepsut s death the amulet became dormant 2 artwork for the cover of 52 week twelve the debut of the character as isis within the main dc comics continuity art by j g jones upon holding the amulet and speaking i am isis adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess 3 she and adam then began traveling the middle east and freeing enslaved children hoping to find adrianna s

planets intergang unsuccessfully attempts to ruin the wedding with a suicide bomber several other shazam characters attend the ceremony and mary marvel captain marvel jr tawky tawny and uncle dudley serve as members of the wedding party isis is a calming influence on black adam transforming him from a ruthless dictator into a more benevolent figure this incarnation of isis has powers similar to black adam s she can also heal wounds of nearly any severity she has control over nature related to her mood rain falls when she s sad even if she is inside flowers bloom when she is happy her first transformation is triggered by the phrase i am isis but later transformations use the phrase oh mighty isis instead adrianna finally locates her brother amon who has been tortured and crippled by whisper a daire for his refusal to join intergang s religion of crime and for his multiple escape attempts isis stops black adam from taking revenge on the intergang members isis is unable to fully heal amon s wounds because they are too deep and complex black adam asks amon to say his name upon doing so amon is struck by shazam s mystic lightning bolt and transformed into osiris reunited with her brother isis decides to change the world beginning with china osiris convinces her to also change the public perception of the black marvel family isis coaxes black adam into joining them in a public unmasking of their secret identities and a public declaration of their good intentions for the future the black marvels defeat the demon sabbac at halloween when he tries to sacrifice children to neron further increasing their popularity during a charity dinner with mrs sivana osiris befriends a humanoid crocodile sobek that escaped from sivana s lab amanda waller is not convinced of the black marvels good intentions and she forms a new suicide squad she sends the persuader to attack isis with his radioactive ax osiris rushes to help her and he cuts the persuader in half osiris is distraught over the unintentional death and isis whisks him away from the scene photographic evidence of the incident turns public opinion against the black marvel family osiris believes that his powers make him evil and he blames black adam a series of calculated events arranged by intergang lead to osiris death at the hands of sobek the black marvels battle with the four horsemen of the apocalypse manifested in physical forms controlled by intergang and doctor sivana isis dies when she is infected with diseases from the horseman pestilence while she defends adam against the horseman death before she dies isis tells adam that she was wrong in trying to change him and she begs him to avenge her and osiris deaths adam s path of vengeance instigates world war iii several weeks later an unidentified individual takes isis amulet adrianna appears to be trapped inside it one year later edit in black adam the dark age adam now under his civilian title of teth adam gets into khandaq under a false name and takes her remains despite a shootout in which nearly all his men are killed in the mountains he is forced to eat his servant hassan who offers himself to black adam he fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb he resurrects isis using the lazarus pit her resurrection is short lived as adam is forced to kill isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life her bones are then transferred to doctor fate s tower where with the assistance of felix faust adam turns them into a magical conduit to imbue himself with god like powers taken from isis corpse itself apparently isis still could be revived but every time adam takes power from her her bones become more brittle jeopardizing a new attempt at resurrection faust reveals that it is isis amulet that can revive her and that mary marvel and captain marvel jr broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe it is later revealed that the missing fragments of her body the reason the lazarus pit failed were being held by atom smasher who found it when the justice society investigated the tomb he meets black adam and gives them to him finally black adam manages to find the pieces of the amulet and reunites it with the now complete skeleton the spell apparently backfires resulting in a shambling rotting corpse a séance takes place in which isis spirit swears eternal hate for her husband before returning to death black adam flees laden with guilt emptiness and rage then faust begins the real rite having shown black adam the skeleton of ralph dibny as a way to hide the real isis from him and blame her rotten condition on black adam s abuse of their now shared powers so isis is able to be fully restored to life even if bound by powerful spells to drain her will and bind her to mindless obedience now a mere puppet in faust s hands isis magic is used to free him from his imprisonment in fate s tower by creating a magical doorway through the tower wall felix faust then drags her away to a hideout where it is strongly implied that he sexually assaults the paralyzed isis 5 later black adam still mourning for her finds a bloodied flower sprouting in their family shrine he takes it as a sign that isis is trying to communicate with him which becomes apparent when he finds a larger collection of flowers in the shape of the shazam lightning bolt symbol pointing in the direction adam must go to find her 6 eventually black adam finds isis and felix faust and adam forces faust to release isis from his control the resurrected isis is far less merciful and forgiving than before and castrates faust for his treatment of her reunited isis and adam travel to the rock of eternity where they banish captain marvel back to earth as a powerless billy batson isis has turned him back using magic lightning from saying shazam from a spell book and begin setting a plan in motion to cleanse the earth of evil their way even recruiting mary marvel to their crusade 7 the justice society come to the rock of eternity seeking to help billy only for isis to brutally attack them even throwing jay garrick into the mists covering the rock from which there is no escape 8 during the course of the fight the combatants end up in kahndaq where the people praise black adam s return isis then kills several of the followers claiming that they are tainted by this new earth black adam attempts to protect his people only to be attacked by mary and billy who had been tainted by mary s power at that point jay garrick appears with the spirit of billy s father and shazam whom the former had helped jay recover from the rock of finality adam is convinced to return his power to shazam so that the wizard s spirit can save isis from her corruption shazam is released from his stone form in turn shazam takes the power from isis billy and mary and transforms teth adam and adrianna into statues some time later a shadowy figure appears to the statues in a bolt of lightning wanting them to be his champions 9 brightest day edit after the events of the blackest night storyline osiris is resurrected by the white lantern entity and returns to khandaq vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity osiris takes the petrified bodies of adam and isis and flies off to an unknown destination 10 despite his best efforts osiris is unable to return adam and adrianna to their living states he ultimately aligns himself with deathstroke and his new team of titans after being told that the mercenary can help him return his family to life 11 both adrianna and teth adam are currently stored in deathstroke s base of operations the labyrinth 12 it is ultimately revealed by the white lantern entity that osiris was resurrected with the express purpose of saving adrianna from her fate 13 during a battle with a drug kingpin named elijah osiris experiences a vision of isis after falling asleep due to the villain pisces he is told that he is guilty for his hand in the murder of ryan choi and that in order to free her he will have to kill more people osiris accidentally electrocutes elijah after waking from his vision after yelling isis and returns home to find that more cracks have appeared on isis statue he then surmises that it was elijah s death which caused the cracks and states that he will indeed have to kill more people to free isis from her prison 14 he then kills a guard at arkham asylum using his lightning channelled by saying isis again although he seems to not enjoy this action saying great ra forgive me 15 after killing two bank robbers osiris is confronted by freddy freeman somehow osiris manages to steal freddy s power and give it to isis however isis first words upon being reunited with her brother are what have you done to me 16 it is soon revealed that the killings osiris did in her name have corrupted her soul causing her to haphazardly shift between her kind caring personality and a callous cruel one when osiris back is turned isis breaks out of the labyrinth 17 she goes on a rampage unable to stop herself from using nature to try to destroy the world in desperation she attempts to commit suicide by lightning but osiris shields her with his own body when they awake isis discovers that the corruption has left her but she still feels it inside osiris and it worries her 18 it was later revealed by the entity that isis was brought back to life because she s the one that will aid the swamp thing 19 later isis aids her brother osiris in stopping the quraci soldiers who are attacking kahndaq isis learns that osiris has become more violent killing the soldiers when the justice league attacks deathstroke s titans they are stopped by isis who forces them to leave kahndaq at once she declares her rulership of kahndaq and withdraws the country from the united nations stating that they will outlaw outsiders and recognize no power but their own and that any intrusion will incite world war iii the justice league s only option is to leave and deathstroke s titans leave as well isis then tells osiris that he is not welcome in kahndaq because of his bloodlust 20 the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline adrianna tomaz is a young woman who by fighting specifically against khandaq s evil rule is opposed to her brother amon entering the sons of adam terrorist group however after he is killed by khandaq s forces and she is forced to resurrect black adam adrianna decides to follow a path of violence with an unknown voice saying that she will be chosen to wield power 21 powers and abilities edit in order to change form adrianna must be able to say i am isis thereby invoking spells involving the energies of the extra dimensional being once known as isis on earth this spell adds almost a hundred pounds of impervious godly muscle and tissue to her frame this spell seems to be solely vocal she cannot access this spell if she is gagged or hampered in some way from talking the precision of this spell is somewhat erratic all adrianna has to say is i am isis and she is mystically transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess it was later revealed that the powers that adrianna draws from isis are the most powerful of the eight egyptian gods when her powers were possessed by black adam he was able to fight off most of the superheroes on earth alone when black adam transferred both his and isis s powers to mary marvel she was able to easily withstand darkseid s omega beams after transforming adrianna isis gains physical abilities similar to her brother husband and the other marvels she is superhumanly strong and is easily capable of lifting far in excess of 100 tons putting her on the same level as supergirl power girl mary marvel donna troy big barda and wonder woman isis is also incredibly durable and cannot be harmed by physical force unless

the other marvels isis s powers focus on the control of nature she has control over water fire earth air and electricity and can control the weather and the lava within the earth these powers are tied to her emotions when she cried it began to rain and when she grew angry enormous roses crushed the buildings around her simply put isis is nature and can control its every aspect in addition to her manipulation of natural materials isis possesses the power of telekinesis allowing her to lift objects fire blasts of telekinetic force and to create telekinetic shields isis s godly energies are able to heal nearly any wound that has been inflicted upon her with surprising speed though she has died before using a second amulet isis is able to achieve clairvoyance and is able to see events happening in the present at remote locations however she cannot use this power to see into the past or the future due to her death and subsequent resurrection isis had a bit of trouble controlling her powers for a time she stated that this was because nature had deemed her a failed subject but she has since regained full control other versions edit in the alternate timeline of the flashpoint event isis is mentioned by her brother osiris believing that she has been killed by the atlanteans amazons war 22 it is revealed that isis was held captive by the outsider for black adam into selling the
