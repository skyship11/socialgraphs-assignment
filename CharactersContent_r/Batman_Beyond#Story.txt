warren mcginnis terry disobeys his curfew one night to meet up with his girlfriend dana tan only to be harassed by a gang called the jokerz a high speed motorcycle chase between him and the jokerz ends in the grounds of wayne manor where they run into the elderly bruce wayne bruce and terry fend off the gang side by side but the exertion aggravates bruce s heart condition terry helps him back to the manor and while exploring the mansion stumbles upon the entrance to the batcave and thus discovers bruce s secrets only to be chased out by an angered bruce terry returns home to discover that his father has been murdered apparently by the vengeful jokerz soon after though he discovers that his father had stumbled onto information about the production of illegal chemical weapons by derek powers through wayne powers wayne enterprises had merged with powers company long ago around the time of and following bruce s retirement as batman and that the man actually responsible for his father s murder is powers personal assistant bodyguard mr fixx terry goes to bruce who tells terry to take the evidence to barbara gordon the current police commissioner after the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from terry by derek powers terry subsequently steals the batsuit intending to bring powers to justice bruce initially opposes all of terry s efforts and demands that he return the suit but terry convinces bruce to let him take on the batman mantle and subsequently defeats mr fixx during the battle powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment which subsequently mutates him into a radiation emitting entity though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in gotham without batman s presence bruce offers terry the chance to assume the role of batman with bruce himself mentoring terry and in addition to working as bruce s chauffeur and assistant so that

on patches the longevous ra s al ghul and even the joker himself terry also makes allies in neo gotham including computer genius maxine max gibson after discovering batman s secret identity she helps him with everything from computer hacking to babysitting police commissioner barbara gordon also works with terry though initially unhappy about another person following in bruce s dangerous footsteps and at first vehemently opposed to his efforts to help she admits that the city needs batman he also has a relationship with melanie walker who was forced to do the bidding of her family the new royal flush gang under the codename ten terry would also later encounter superman and the justice league and help them fight an alien threat although he would not join the group until adulthood where he presumably like his mentor before him also operates as a part timer in the episode epilogue the second season finale of justice league unlimited but a conclusion to batman beyond terry in his 30s learns that bruce wayne is his biological father upon questioning wayne s old enemy turned ally amanda waller she reveals to him that she spearheaded project batman beyond to create a successor upon realising the possibility of bruce s eventual retirement or death as he got older and that a world always needed a batman and his unique skillset while this revelation supposedly strained bruce and

to be the new dark knight as he shared a similar loss as bruce had that being the death of a parent kevin conroy as bruce wayne the original batman although initially reluctant he later becomes terry s employer mentor and predecessor who guides terry through the batcomputer but also occasionally ventures into the field to help his successor if the situation demands it despite the risks associated with his age during his final mission as the dark knight twenty years prior to the events of the main story bruce suffered a heart attack that nearly cost him his life forcing him to break his primary moral principle by threatening to kill a criminal with a gun in self defense abhorred that he nearly used the type of weapon that took his parents thomas and martha lives and the very thing that drove him to become a vigilante and afraid of what he might do next wayne reluctantly hung up his cape and cowl cree summer as maxine max gibson a genius high schooler and friend of terry s she discovers his secret identity and from then on occasionally helps batman in an alfred type role though she is considered a nuisance to his predecessor but less so as time went on her parents are divorced and she has an unnamed sister lauren tom as dana tan terry s on and off girlfriend in high school who is initially and formerly unaware of his secret identity as the new dark knight and thus surprised or upset by his frequent absences which she only knows due to him working as a personal assistant for bruce wayne to support his family financially following his father s death she also has a father who is disapproving of terry because of the latter s past as an irresponsible delinquent which serves as a reminder and another motivation for terry being batman frank welker as ace bruce wayne s pet dog

city police department having succeeded her father jim and one of bruce s former crime fighting partners batgirl and was at one point in her younger years romantically involved with him which ended badly unlike her father barbara initially has a rocky relationship with the new batman being aware of his criminal record and showing resentment towards bruce for dragging him into this life and is at first against him intervening in police duty though this is revealed to have been due to a long standing grudge towards bruce for how he treated his former partners and also because of what happened years ago the night the bat family splintered as she later gains respect for terry after he helps her in several sticky situations and begins acknowledging his help whenever needed though does not use a bat signal unlike her father presumably because she has direct access to the batcave from the office and because of her past as batgirl she is married to sam young the district attorney of neo

thus accepting the idea of either bruce retiring or being killed at some point finding the idea of a world without batman unacceptable waller used her project cadmus connections to gather the technology for project batman beyond whose goal was to physically create a new batman starting with a secretly collected sample of bruce wayne s dna some years after bruce retired waller found a young neo gotham couple the mcginnises with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of bruce s parents a nanotech solution was injected into warren mcginnis to rewrite his reproductive material with that of bruce the eventual result was his wife mary mcginnis giving birth to terry a child sharing the genetic traits of his mother and bruce wayne when terry was eight years old waller employed an elderly andrea beaumont in her phantasm alias as an assassin to kill terry s family hoping the trauma would put him on the path to becoming batman however beaumont could not commit the act arguing that she would be doing something against what bruce stood for waller eventually conceded that beaumont had been right and abolished the project altogether eight years afterward warren would be murdered and terry would meet bruce by happenstance resulting in terry becoming batman s successor waller concludes by reminding terry that he is bruce s son not his clone and that despite the
