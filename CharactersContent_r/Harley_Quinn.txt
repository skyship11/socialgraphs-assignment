reading 12 external links history creation and development harley quinn as she appears in the dc animated universe art by bruce timm harley quinn was created by paul dini and bruce timm for the 1992 batman the animated series episode entitled joker s favor while dini was writing the episode 7 initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk on role harley quinn was intended to appear in just one episode 8 9 as dini was putting together the story for the episode he wanted to introduce a foil for the supervillain joker dini recalled the way i created her was i was writing a story called joker s favor and it was my first joker story and i wanted to make it good and i wanted to make the joker everything he is in the better comics books which is funny and scary and egotistical and i thought maybe a foil would bring out some of those personality traits 10 11 he then thought of giving joker a female henchperson inspired by the molls of the 1960s live action batman series 9 12 13 and then decided she would be a funny counterpart to the joker to maybe work up a little punch and judy attitude between them 10 dini stated she could crack a joke and the henchmen would laugh and the joker would kind of glare at her 14 in 1991 after seeing his college friend arleen sorkin play a roller skating jester from a dream sequence in the soap opera days of our lives dini decided to have sorkin voice her 10 13 dini then partly based harley quinn on sorkin with dini incorporating aspects of sorkin such as her very snappy wisecracking bubbly blonde personality into the character as well as her mannerisms 14 11 10 in recording harley quinn s voice sorkin spoke in her normal brooklyn accent while putting in a little yiddish sound since dini made the character jewish another aspect of the character borrowed from sorkin 13 15 16 17 external mediaimages paul dini s original design for harley quinn a crazy blond character in a miniskirt based on actress barbara eden and 1940s screwballs such as betty hutton gloria grahame and claudette colbert 14 18 video the dream sequence from the show days of our lives in which arleen sorkin plays a jester which served as inspiration for the character s creation dini came across the scene while watching a vhs tape of sorkin s favorite days moments given to dini by sorkin 10 13 dini had several names in mind while naming the character such as columbine and eventually settled on the name harley quinn 19 dini chose the name for the character to be in line with other batman characters s names being puns and also because he thought harley was a fun name for a girl 20 14 the name harley quinn is a play on harlequin a stock character from the sixteenth century italian physical comedy theater commedia dell arte 9 21 in designing the character timm did a simplified supervillain version of traditional harlequin gear from the commedia dell arte original he took the jester hat ruffled collar diamond pattern and domino mask and put them on a red and black bodysuit on which the diamonds were strategically placed for easier animation 9 16 timm took harley quinn s red and black motif from the golden age comic book character daredevil 9 dini had previously made a rough design for the character which timm improved on 13 expanded role eventually each of the directors wanted to do a harley episode so the character began to appear in stories without the joker over the years she allied herself with best gal pal poison ivy for occasional romps through gotham and has even succeeded in giving batman a hard time on her own we now look upon harley as our series wild card capable of showing up anytime to bedevil our heroes with her screwball antics paul dini 11 the more we used harley and the more we used her in different roles the more we discovered what a richer character she was she just blossomed in a very short time to the point where she was just as interesting as catwoman or penguin or ra s al ghul or one of the other core batman characters paul dini 14 after seeing harley quinn in the rough cut of joker s favor the producers of batman the animated series which include dini and timm were impressed with the result with dini wanting to bring the character back for more episodes 22 9 timm and another producer alan burnett were initially reluctant of this and thought that giving joker a girlfriend played more towards his comedic side and would humanize him too much which contrasted their vision for joker as a character who is as serious a threat as possible to batman 22 9 nevertheless months after joker s favor harley made a second appearance on the show in the episode the laughing fish and became the joker s love interest 9 harley quinn gained popularity with fans of the animated series with the character being featured more on the show and eventually starring in her own episodes such as 1993 s harley and ivy which introduced a friendship between harley quinn and fellow supervillain poison ivy and 1994 s harlequinade and harley s holiday which explored harley quinn s life without the joker 23 24 25 harley quinn then became a recurring character in the dc animated universe appearing in the animated series sequel the new batman adventures and in non batman animation such as superman the animated series static shock and justice league on february 7 1994 she made her first appearance in a video game in the adventures of batman and robin an action platformer based on batman the animated series 26 27 transition to comic books tango with evil by alex ross from the cover of harley s canonical debut batman harley quinn widely described as iconic the artwork depicts harley dancing with a tuxedo clad joker and was later recreated in the 2016 film suicide squad 28 22 29 30 31 32 because of her popularity harley quinn was adapted into dc s comic books 33 in september 1993 a year following harley quinn s first appearance in batman the animated series the character made her comic book debut in the twelfth issue of the batman adventures a series set in the universe of the animated series and became a regular character 6 7 in 1997 she appeared in the story batman thrillkiller released under elseworlds a dc comics imprint that published out of continuity alternate reality stories as hayley fitzpatrick 6 in 1999 she became a canonical character with the release of batman harley quinn 1 6 origin story main article the batman adventures mad love bruce and i were talking about what if there was some sort of surprise to her origin what if she s not just a hench girl we came up with the idea that she had been a doctor at arkham asylum and the joker had gotten into her head and worked her into being his follower then we thought what if harley s in the role of the long suffering girlfriend paul dini about the creation of mad love 14 in february 1994 the one shot the batman adventures mad love recounting harley s origin was released written by dini and drawn by timm the story marks their first comic book collaboration 22 mad love introduces harley quinn as a former psychiatrist named harleen quinzel who fell in love with the joker during her internship at gotham city s arkham asylum and details her transformation into the joker s villainous accomplice harley quinn as well as the joker s lack of respect for harley 22 24 34 35 widely considered the definitive harley quinn story 36 37 38 mad love added dimensions to the character with dini introducing harley quinn s motivations as well as establishing her as a tragic figure and sympathetic villain 39 40 41 42 43 the story received wide praise and won the eisner and harvey awards for best single issue in the same year and was later adapted into an episode of the same name in the new batman adventures in 1999 44 45 25 name origin harley quinn s actual name is established in mad love as harleen frances quinzel harleen frances was borrowed by dini from sorkin s first and middle name arleen frances quinzel was taken from a former teacher of dini s from emerson college named quenzel 14 introduction to main dc continuity harley quinn was adapted into the main dc universe with the 1999 one shot graphic novel batman harley quinn written by dini and illustrated by yvel guichet 46 which put her origin in the middle of the no man s land storyline 47 dini changed harley and joker s relationship to be darker to match joker s character in the comics in the story joker attempts to kill harley at the first opportunity dini also gave harley new abilities such as immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility which she received after having been injected a special formula by poison ivy these changes were made to match the needs of the dc universe on her new abilities dini said i figured if she d be going head to head with batman and the other dc heroes harley would need some kind of physical edge 22 46 first ongoing series the series is an interesting assignment because the main character is a insane and b a criminal and both of these things are pretty essential to the character so we don t want to get rid of either of them we hammered out a direction for the book which will establish a motivation and agenda for harley depending on the storyline she will be on the side of the angels sometimes and on the side of the demons and devils on others like most great crime characters she s not concerned with the law what concerns her is something totally different what that is will be revealed as the first half dozen issues progress karl kesel 2000 48 while pursuing new assignments at dc comics offices in new york city karl kesel was approached by former dc editor matt idelson to create a pitch for harley quinn s first ongoing series which karl accepted being a fan of the character after having read dini s mad love 22 kesel chose terry dodson as the artist for the series whose art kesel thought complemented the character s cartoonish roots and worldview 22 49 kesel called dodson and asked him if he was interested on working on the comic to which dodson agreed and the two worked for a month on their proposal for the series which was to make a comic about love gone horribly terribly wrong 49 22 the proposal was accepted by dc comics and the pair began work on the series with kesel and dodson both being involved in the storytelling and dodson bringing in his wife rachel dodson to ink 22 kesel s run on the series began being published in december 2000 and was about harley quinn leaving the joker and becoming a solo criminal alongside a supporting cast of henchmen named the quinntets 22 because of underwhelming sales his 25 issue run ended in december 2002 and dc decided to change the creative team the series was given to writer a j lieberman and artists mike huddleston and troy nixey by idelson and took on a grittier and darker direction contrasting kesel s run 50 the decision renewed interest in the character but the sales remained lackluster and the series was cancelled in 2003 50 13 gotham city sirens main article gotham city sirens after years of scarce appearances in comics harley quinn resurfaced in a leading role in july 2009 with gotham city sirens a team up title created by dini 51 6 13 the series brought together batman s most popular female villains harley quinn catwoman and poison ivy in an unstable alliance 52 53 54 the series also expanded on harley quinn s background and early life in gotham city sirens 7 dini established the character s hometown being brooklyn and also introduced her dysfunctional family with her swindling father being described as the main reason for her pursuing psychiatry 55 56 57 the first several issues of gotham city sirens were written by dini and illustrated by guillem march other creatives who worked for the series include writers tony bedard and peter calloway and artists david lópez andres guinaldo peter nguyen jeremy haun and ramon bachs 53 the series was cancelled in august 2011 for the new 52 dc comics relaunch of their entire comic line 54 the new 52 suicide squad one thing that we re trying to show with her and i don t think it gets played with enough with harley is here s a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor we re trying to play up that quality she is crazy but there is something behind the madness in the new dcu maybe everyone doesn t get shipped off to arkham asylum some people may have to do hard time and get shipped off to belle reve the prison the suicide squad operates out of and her presence here doesn t mean she hasn t been or won t end up in arkham basically we needed a bad girl character and the best bad girl character in the dcu is harley quinn adam glass 2011 58 as part of the new 52 reboot in september 2011 harley quinn was reintroduced by adam glass as a prominent member of the supervillain team task force x in the relaunched suicide squad series 24 59 the character was heavily redesigned to fit the tone of the book her color motif was changed to red and blue her jester costume was replaced with a revealing ensemble consisting of a corset and hot pants her skin was bleached white and her previously blonde hair was altered to half blue and half red 60 13 59 61 her personality had also been depicted to be more violent and psychopathic than her former iteration 13 33 59 external image the controversial cover artwork for suicide squad vol 4 1 which introduced harley quinn s revealing look for the relaunched title 13 art by ryan benjamin in the series glass separated harley quinn from the joker and explored her becom ing her own person with the suicide squad becoming a family to her 62 63 glass stated harley s always wanted to belong to something and if not joker then the team and she s finding herself in all this she s finding her place in the world that she s not just a sidekick 63 suicide squad was cancelled in april 2014 to coincide with the conclusion of the forever evil storyline 64 new origin in the seventh issue of suicide squad glass revised harley quinn s origin story making it reflect the joker s origins in the story the joker takes harleen quinzel to the chemical plant where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will which bleaches her skin and drives her insane resulting in her transformation to harley quinn similar to the joker s transformation in his origins 65 this origin was received negatively by fans of the character who felt that its removal of harley quinn s choice to become the joker s accomplice herself as depicted in her previous origin stories took out an essential part of her character 65 second ongoing series textless cover art of the series first issue featuring harley quinn s roller derby inspired costume harley quinn co creator bruce timm said of the design i really like amanda s design a lot because it s modern and a little bit punk rock but it s really fun without being trashy i think the whole roller derby look is really fun because it s tough but it s still playful it s not it s not skanky 22 art by amanda conner and paul mounts harley

joker behind 24 70 71 in contrast to harley quinn s depiction in glass suicide squad palmiotti and conner wrote harley quinn with a lighthearted cartoonish and humorous tone her costume has also been changed with a roller derby inspired costume designed by conner which incorporates conner s favorite aspects of harley quinn s early costume and her costume in glass suicide squad 68 72 66 the series also brought back harley quinn s red and black motif 61 the series began being published in november 2013 starting with harley quinn 0 which brought together seventeen comic book artists including

controversies the cover of the first issue of the new 52 s suicide squad title drew controversy for its oversexualized depiction of harley quinn 13 this also caused some fans of the character to send glass hatemail and personal threats 62 in september 2013 dc comics announced an art contest entitled break into comics with harley quinn in which contestants were to draw harley in four different suicide scenarios this contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to national suicide prevention week but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of harley quinn in the fourth scenario in which the character attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub the american foundation for suicide prevention american psychiatric association and national alliance on mental illness all responded to the controversy in an emailed group statement to huffington post stating we are disappointed that dc comics has decided to host a contest looking for artists to develop ways to depict suicide attempts by one of its main villains harley quinn after seeing the reactions to the contest dc comics apologized saying they should have made it clear it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously in the final version the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with harley quinn sitting on a rocket while flying in space 79 80 81 dc rebirth in june 2016 the

harley quinn s past as a former intern in animal research at s t a r labs where she met her pet hyenas bud and lou 93 in the second part of the story dini and palmiotti explained harley quinn s change

fear state crossover event 98 skills abilities and equipment harley quinn has no superpowers and relies on her unpredictability gymnastics skills and weapons and hand to hand proficiency 99 she is a peak athlete having won a gymnastics scholarship at gotham city s gotham state university 99 100 22 following her transition to main dc canon in 1999 harley quinn was established as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength agility durability and reflexes which she received after having been injected a serum concocted by poison ivy 99 vengeance unlimited part five harley quinn vol 1 30 revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater 101 harley quinn is skilled in using various weapons often employing weaponized clown themed gag items including pop guns rubber chickens and a gun that shoots a boxing glove as well as oversized pistols and mallets the latter being her signature weapon 102 103 104 other weapons she uses include unconventional weapons such as a baseball bat explosive weapons such as bazookas customized bombs and dynamites 105 firearms such as pistols assault rifles and machine guns 105 harley quinn also has a pair of pet hyenas bud and lou which she can order to attack her opponents 99 despite being mentally unstable and sometimes distracted harley is highly intelligent her intellect extends to her psychological tactical and deception abilities but she does not stand out for particular strategic or scientific skills and often remains subordinate to the joker who between the two is the genius and the inventor harleen quinzel earned a bachelor s degree in psychology and as a former arkham psychiatrist was highly qualified in psychoanalysis criminology and forensic psychiatry while not on par with joker she is still an expert tactician deceiver and escapologist and still shows traces of her psychological experience harley quinn is the only person besides the joker to concoct joker venom the joker s signature weapon and is shown to have reverse engineered its formula and developed an antitoxin 106 107 she also has an indomitable pathological will just like poison ivy sometimes and not as much harley uses her feminine charm to attract men but only to be able to manipulate them unlike the joker she is able to simulate sanity thus being able to pretend to be a normal person in this way she disguised herself as a security guard a lawyer and even poison ivy and batgirl romantic interests harley quinn has had several love interests the most notable being joker and poison ivy other love interests include mason macabre a character created by conner and palmiotti 108 plastic man was initially intended to be a love interest for harley quinn by kesel but was not approved by dc 109 the joker so harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the joker that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity but actually in the process she lost hers before she knew it she had fallen head over heels in love with him i think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her and then realized he had opened pandora s box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does i think he finds that in some ways very sexy and attractive but he s not really set up to love in the way a regular person is i think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship but i would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense paul dini 2017 12 the joker is harley quinn s former lover harley s solo comics often explores her former association with the joker through flashbacks of their past exploits present day conflicts or through harley as she laments his absence 110 harley often refers to him as mistah j and puddin 111 their relationship is known for its abusive and codependent nature first established in harley s first origin story mad love 22 the joker habitually abuses harley and despite the abuse harley quinn returns to him 112 in the 1999 one shot comic batman harley quinn the joker decides to kill harley after admitting that he does care for her that their relationship is romantic and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose 113 dini describes their relationship as abusive 114 and empathizes with harley s feelings of abandonment with dini basing most of harley s dialogue on his past experiences 115 the joker s controlling and codependent relationship with harley quinn has been analyzed as a means of the joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or batman 116 joker mirrors his identity through harley in her appearance and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her he continues to try to subject her to his control 116 when harley successfully defeats batman in mad love 1994 the joker emasculated by his own failure severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him however while harley recovers the joker sends her flowers which she accepts reasserting his control over her 117 poison ivy harley quinn and poison ivy in new roots from batman urban legends 1 art by laura braga poison ivy is harley quinn s current love interest and best friend and harley often refers to her as red 118 ivy was first introduced as a new friend to harley by dini in the 1993 batman the animated series episode harley and ivy 119 the episode came from dini wanting to make harley a stronger character and write a story where she leaves the joker dini decided to pair her up with ivy because she was the strongest contrast to harley 119 the two later became close friends within the dc animated universe dini has stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kids cartoon at the time prevented it from happening 41 prior to the new 52 reboot ivy is shown as having teamed up on occasion with harley with harley being her best friend and recurring ally unlike most villain team ups their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect ivy sincerely wants to save harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the joker accordingly poison ivy despises the joker and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity in the final storyline of the gotham city sirens series harley suggests that ivy may be in love with her an accusation that stuns her 120 the following issue has poison ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love harley but the details of her love are never specified and the series ended with the new 52 reboot before their relationship could be addressed 121 conner and palmiotti hinted at a romantic relationship in the new 52 harley quinn series 75 71 and later confirmed that harley and ivy are in a non monogamous relationship 122 35 2017
