1 in 1938 which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to earth he made his first full fledged appearance in the superman newspaper comic strip in 1939 where his name was spelled as jor l his name first appeared as being spelled jor el in the superman novel the adventures of superman 1942 written by george lowther later comic books capitalized the e in el jor el s first appearance in a comic book was in more fun comics 101 jor el left and wife lara right as statues in superman s silver age fortress of solitude from dc special series 26 june 1981 art by ross andru in the 1960s now known as part of the silver age of comic books dc comics introduced to its superhero stories the fictional concept of different versions of characters from real world publication history existing in separate universes that could communicate with each other 4 5 as dc developed this concept through further stories the version of superman s father during the previous golden age of comic books was identified as jor l matching the original spelling of the character s name who lived on the krypton of the earth two universe derived from the versions of characters and stories that appeared during the earlier golden age period of publication history in contrast the concept presented jor el as no longer another spelling of the same name but a different character entirely the father of the then contemporary silver age version of superman who lived on the krypton of the earth one universe used to describe the setting for then current silver age stories and characters some of which had been substantially changed from their golden age versions 6 a retelling of superman s origin story in 1948 first delved into detail about jor el however his formal and more familiar silver age aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s over the course of the next several decades there was a definitive summarization in the miniseries world of krypton in 1979 not to be confused with the similarly named post crisis on infinite earths late 1980s comic miniseries his accomplishments edit as presented in the world of krypton miniseries and other stories from the silver age of comic books jor el was krypton s leading scientist inventing among other devices the jor el a hovercar he also discovered a parallel plane of existence which he called the phantom zone and invented a device by which it could be entered which he called the phantom zone projector this device got him a seat on the science council krypton s ruling body he lived in krypton s major city of kryptonopolis even before jor el s birth the el family was renowned across krypton for its various contributions to kryptonian society ancestors of jor el included val el a famous explorer sul el the inventor of krypton s first telescope tala el the author of krypton s first planetary constitution hatu el the inventor of krypton s first electromagnet and first electric motor and gam el the father of modern kryptonian architecture family life edit family emblem of the house of el the popular logo of his son kal el jor el had two brothers zor el who lived in argo city and eventually became the father of kara alias supergirl and an identical twin brother named nim el who lived in kandor in several stories jor el s father was established as jor el i and his mother as nimda nee an dor citation needed jor el eventually met and married lara the daughter of lor van and a young astronaut in krypton s fledgling space program which was soon permanently grounded after jax ur blew up one of krypton s inhabited moons leading to eternal banishment to the phantom zone 7 the two had an infant son kal el jor el s warnings of krypton s doom edit when krypton began experiencing a series of earthquakes jor el investigated he soon discovered to his horror that krypton s core was extremely unstable and indeed radioactive and worse that it would eventually reach critical mass and explode taking the entire planet and its populace with it 8 jor el tried to convince the members of the science council of this impending disaster and urged re establishing krypton s space program so giant spacecraft could be built to carry the populace to another habitable world however the council was dismissive of jor el s findings and refused to comply with his plan some even accused him of treachery trying to cause chaos so he could take over this had been a plot of general zod s which having failed caused his banishment to the phantom zone thus the council was wary of jor el s motives around the time he discovered his homeworld s impending doom jor el met his own son kal el without realizing it kal el had accidentally travelled back in time there were supporters of jor el s theory but when a ship was constructed to evacuate them the city of kandor was shrunken and stolen by brainiac removing the people who believed in jor el s work 9 frustrated jor el continued his work on space travel on his own hoping to build a spacecraft to save his own family this work included launching several smaller test rockets one of these rockets included the family dog who responded to the name of krypto 10 however as time ran short jor el soon found that he would only have enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son kal el he decided to send kal el to earth realizing he would gain superhuman powers under earth s more intense yellow sun and lower gravity as krypton finally went through its final destructive stages jor el and lara placed their son in the rocket and launched him toward earth before they themselves were killed along with almost all the rest of the planet s population lara could have fit inside the rocket as well but she chose to stay behind to increase kal el s chances of reaching earth post crisis edit after the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths and john byrne s 1986 miniseries the man of steel rewrote superman s origins details about jor el s background and character were changed in byrne s version jor el inhabited a cold and emotionally sterile krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden indeed jor el himself was considered a throwback for actually expressing emotions toward his mate lara and favoring the less sterilized days of past kryptonian eras another change in this version was jor el genetically altering his son s fetus gestating in a birthing matrix to allow him to leave krypton in this version of the mythos kryptonians were genetically bonded to the planet itself not allowing them to leave and merely attaching a warp engine to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale the result was that kal el was born when the birthing matrix opened on earth in the 1990s series starman jor el meets a time traveling jack knight and mikaal tomas two individuals who both bore at various points the name starman and had been accidentally sent 70 years back in time and hurled across space jor el thereby first learns of earth s existence in return jor el helps knight and tomas escape from his overbearing father seyg el in the 2004 miniseries superman birthright jor el along with krypton and lara was more or less reinstated to his silver age versions though with such updated touches as lara contributing equally to the effort of sending kal el once again an infant while on krypton to earth in this version jor el discovers earth moments before launching his son s spacecraft also the conclusion of the miniseries has the adult superman on earth seeing his parents through lex luthor s time space communicator and on krypton seconds before its destruction jor el and lara see their son alive and well on earth and know that their efforts were successful as with byrne s conflicting view of krypton the birthright origins of jor el krypton and luthor have recently been retconned and following infinite crisis they are no longer valid in comics canon however a more recent storyline co written by geoff johns and superman director richard donner presented yet another version of jor el and krypton which reintroduced general zod and the phantom zone criminals with art by adam kubert jor el is depicted for the first time with a beard and the design of kryptonian society is distinct yet again from birthright and man of steel incorporating elements of donner s work on the first two christopher reeve films in particular the notion of krypton s council threatening jor el with harsh penalty of exile to the very phantom zone he himself had discovered if he were to make public his predictions of their planet s imminent doom or otherwise attempt to create a climate of panic jor el is shown here to have been mentored by friend and noted scientist non who corroborated jor el s findings regarding krypton s impending destruction when the two were arrested and brought to trial before the council by zod and ursa when non defies the council s dire prohibitions and elects to spread the word of the coming apocalypse he is abducted by council agents and apparently lobotomized thus explaining the character s mute simple mindedness brutality and destructiveness in line with jack o halloran s performance as non in the first two reeve films appalled zod and ursa propose to jor el that they band together and overthrow the council but jor el will have none of it when their murderous insurrection fails the council forces jor el to exile them to the phantom zone and never speak of his findings again lest he face the same fate for this perceived betrayal zod declares that he will escape and conquer krypton confident that jor el will actually discover some way to save the planet and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day having been re built via a kryptonian crystal during the one year later story arc the current version of the fortress of solitude which was also designed to essentially be visually identical to the donner and bryan singer films now contains an advanced interactive recording of jor el which although visually dissimilar to marlon brando is otherwise identical in function to that featured in superman returns superman batman 50 presents jor el sending a probe to earth that makes contact with thomas wayne while he is on a drive with a pregnant martha the probe holographically transmitting thomas consciousness to krypton so that jor el could better learn what kind of world earth was to help him decide which of many possible candidates he should send his son to thomas tells jor el that the people of earth aren t perfect but are essentially a good and kind race who would raise the child right convincing jor el to send kal el there thomas recorded his encounter in a diary which was discovered by his son bruce wayne in
