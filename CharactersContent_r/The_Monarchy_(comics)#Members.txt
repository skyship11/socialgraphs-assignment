this section may not include all significant viewpoints please improve the article or discuss the issue december 2010 learn how and when to remove this template message a reviewer of bullets over babylon a trade paperback of the book s first five issues noted i was never a fan of the authority i enjoy the concept and all but after the first story arch sic it just seemed to be biting itself in the ass going in circles recycling one theme over and over until stale what young and mccrea have done though is taken a rather limited idea and given it more vision and more focus the monarchy gives the authority more credibility in my eyes it does what good spin offs should do it gives you something to compare to and grow from i sincerely hope the whole series sees collected format in the long run because i m sure in time it will be one of those sought after classics on people s shelves beside the prisoner and moonshadow and other things like that 2 members edit jackson king telekinetic and telepath former leader of stormwatch as battalion jackson became the un liaison to the authority after stormwatch disbanded he grew more and more displeased with the authority and accepted the weaver
