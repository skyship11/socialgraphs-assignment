12 she is seen working as a strip club bouncer who moonlights as a teenage mercenary and reunites with her father after someone puts a hit on her her past in the new 52 continuity also appears to be retconned as she makes no mention of n o w h e r e and claims to have been trained by nightwing much to slade s annoyance 13 as a young adult rose worked as a bouncer and precognitive mercenary accepting contracts to prevent other hitmen from carrying out theirs the latter job in particular earning slade s disdain when slade learned of an assassination notice put out on her he reappeared in her life under the guise of wanting to help her track down the one responsible following an encounter with batman it was revealed that deathstroke himself put the hit out on her as a means to bond with her disillusioned with her already troubled relationship with her father rose instead decided to bond with her mother s family seeking them out in northern vietnam where she learned of the name her mother had given her xia before finding her mother s family in minneapolis 14 despite being happy with her new family hacker hosun park sought her out for protection from her father proposing to her under the impression that deathstroke would not harm his daughter s husband rose refused but after learning that her new family was in actuality hired by slade accepted hosun s proposal in order

learn about her hmong heritage soon after an enraged jericho attacked his father for supposedly killing etienne rose being injured when she attempted to restrain her brother leaving her with a fractured skull 15 powers and abilities edit original powers edit inheriting abilities from her progenitor and having them enhanced via mainlining of the super soldier serum that gave deathstroke his powers rose wilson possesses increased reflexes stamina agility speed strength and heightened mental acuity but was also prone to psychotic episodes such as when she gouged out her own eye to be more like her father while under its effects she has received some training from nightwing including the virtues of being a hero she also possesses a precognitive sense that lets her see into the immediate future this allows her to react to oncoming attacks against her and to counter them accordingly she currently wields twin energy katanas that can cut through anything except flesh and briefly merge into an energy shield she also carries with her a small stash of adrenaline both because clock king had briefly managed to make her addicted to the substance and also because while high on adrenaline her precognitive sense evolves into the ability to glimpse scenes from her immediate future however the more she uses adrenaline to enhance her powers the more her metabolism is unbalanced straining her health the new 52 and dc rebirth powers edit in the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity the source of rose s powers are metagenes she can dampen another person s powers and abilities such as weakening

these facilities also psychically link her to other gen actives enabling multi way mental communication with people enhanced by the gen factor 18 the limits of these powers are still unknown in rebirth publishing ravager reacquires her old superhuman skill set prior to flashpoint the only difference being she now derives her abilities from the hereditary metagene begotten from her father which became active due to prolonged exposure to mr wilson s sword the deathstroke 19 retaining the enhanced conditional practices of superhuman strength durability agility healing etc she also had been bestowed a unique variation of the enhanced mind her father possessed beyond the simple augmented brain percentage giving deathstroke his genius intellect rose has an accelerated probability
