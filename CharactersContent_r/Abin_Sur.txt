subsequently journeys to earth in an effort to learn more about the blackest night so that he might stop the prophecy s fulfillment during his quest abin sur begins to lose his faith in his willpower

who was allegedly his worst enemy and responsible for the death of his daughter to the planet to become the first indigo tribe all subsequent members of the tribe being selected as the worst psychopaths of their worlds abin sur did this as he foresaw the danger that the guardians of the universe would pose once the blackest night had passed and sought to find a way to stop the guardians

about refugees two lanterns jessica cruz and simon baz bring molites to ungara but not all are welcoming simon and jessica make friends with several ungarans who honor the nobility of abin sur and thus have no problems with the molites 27 spaceship edit the question was raised of why abin sur needed a ship but in the green lantern origins serial it is stated that out of paranoia of the prophecy of his destruction he navigated the cosmos in a ship filled with weapons not trusting the powers of his ring as the prophecy stated that his ring would fail him when he needed it most pre crisis explanation edit in the story earth s first green lantern jordan revealed that he wondered that himself and asked his ring to explain the ring told the story of how abin sur found a world which was still at a middle age stage of advancement even though it should have been in the atomic age and discovered a parasitic energy being species that fed on sentient beings i factor a substance that enabled inventiveness attacking civilizations and stalling their development as they had no i factor themselves sur captured them to stop their destruction placing them in a bubble but one of their number had escaped as it was attacking another world and vowed to free his brethren to do so he tracked down sur s planet and created a disaster by making a volcano erupt to force him to appear to stop it since sur did not mask himself the being recognized him immediately and followed him to his home as sur neglected to charge his ring before going to sleep he was unable to stop the being from taking control of him with the being in control of his body and about to force him to go and free his fellows sur tricked the being into thinking that he would not be able to do so because the ring would be low on power after the trip there while in reality the ring s charge is purely time based the being decided to have sur take a ship to the destination but before leaving sur managed to get a hold of his invisible power battery without the creature noticing on the ship sur piloted the ship and waited until he moved into a green colored planetary radiation belt which allowed sur to charge his ring without the being noticing as his ring glowed green when recharging thus armed sur battled and captured the being sending it of into orbit of the same star that his fellow beings were imprisoned at however during the fight the ship wandered into earth s radiation belt with his ring useless sur lost control of the battered ship and crashed mortally wounded sur sought out his replacement and drew jordan to him jordan learnt of this from the ring according to jordan this account prompted him to keep a secret identity as a security precaution and to carefully navigate around earth s radiation belts post crisis explanation edit in tales of the green lantern corps annual 2 1986 story tygers writer alan moore answered the question with a story of how the hero once visited ysmault a prison planet for an ancient race of demons the empire of tears vanquished millennia ago by the oans he was on a rescue mission and felt he could not wait for instruction from the guardians while there abin sur met a demon named qull of the five inversions a humanoid with a gaping mouth in his chest and a tongue shaped head crucified by three glowing spikes topped with the symbol of the green lantern corps this unholy messiah predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard vacuum abin sur worried by this prophecy began using a starship for interstellar voyages as an additional safeguard a decade later fleeing his enemy his spaceship collided with a girdle of yellow radiation around earth that rendered his starship and his power ring useless within moments had he relied on his ring alone he realized he might have tested the planet s magnetosphere before rashly entering it thus while legion may have wounded him it could be argued that it was qull that was actually responsible for abin sur s death having sown the seeds of doubt in the green lantern s mind green lantern secret
