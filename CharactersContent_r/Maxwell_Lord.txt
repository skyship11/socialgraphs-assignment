brutally beat batman in the belief that he is brainiac lord subsequently sends superman to attack wonder woman after making him believe that she is his old enemy doomsday who has just killed his wife lois lane lord justifies the resulting destruction as proof of his argument about the dangers of superhumans pointing out the devastation that wonder woman and superman could cause if they fought in a crowded area and arguing that the fact that superman can be brought under another s control is evidence that superhumans cannot be relied upon in the midst of her battle with superman diana realizes that even if she defeats him he would still remain under lord s absolute mental control she creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to lord s location and asks that he release superman lord bound by her lasso of truth complies but states that he ll use superman again to kill people when she demands to know how to free superman from lord s control lord replies kill me wonder

from shooting alexander luthor jr accepting that diana did what she had to do and acknowledging that for all their differences they all still want justice at the crisis counseling panel at wizard world chicago dan didio explained dc s reasoning in using lord s character in infinite crisis after going through several possible characters who could be the new leader for the offshoot of checkmate maxwell lord was suggested many of the editors thought that the idea made sense as lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously the idea was dropped due to the continuity errors such as him being a cyborg but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable didio explained we thought about that aspect of the story where maxwell was turned into a cyborg some more and then asked did anyone read it no did anyone like the idea no so we moved ahead with max as being a human and having been a human and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story we wanted what was best for countdown to infinite crisis and for us that meant that max had to be a human 12 one year later edit main article one year later lord reappeared in 2007 in the first two story arcs of the new booster gold series by geoff johns and dan jurgens at the end of the 52 pick up story arc booster gold and blue beetles from

awareness of him reflecting on his past contact with lord before reality was reset although the combined forces of the league and the squad are able to defeat lord s allies they are unable to prevent lord from achieving his goal with the aid of a controlled killer frost lord acquires the heart of darkness from a vault using it to enhance his powers to infect take control of the league 46 lord uses the infected justice league apart from batman who lord did not infect to achieve peace across america and has waller kidnapped and taken before him however despite believing that he had taken precautions to control the heart lord is forced by waller to recognize that it is manipulating his perceptions using lord s powers to spread chaos and evil across the world and twisting lord s perception of what is transpiring when waller is able to bring him to his senses lord tries to remove the heart of darkness but it consumes him and transforms him into eclipso 47 eclipso is driven out of lord when killer frost is able to use her powers to create a prism of ice channeling superman s heat vision at just the right frequency to disrupt lord s hold on his slaves with lord subsequently being immobilized by killer frost lord awakens in a cell specially designed to hold him with injectors pumping so much blood thinner into him that he would bleed to death if he attempted to access his powers he mockingly asks waller if she set this whole thing up just to justify the squad to the league but waller declines to reply and simply informs him that he is to prepare himself for service on task force xi 48 lord later works under the supervision of wonder woman in order to stop his dangerous technology from threatening innocent people 49 powers and abilities edit in his original depictions maxwell lord had no abilities but later became a metahuman as a result of the dominators invasion of earth lord s powers allow him to telepathically influence people s minds typically in the form of pushing a subconscious suggestion to others using his power causes max s nose to bleed and requires great mental strain over time lord s powers grew to the point where he could take full control of other beings even superman although it required a great deal of time and patience for him to establish the necessary level of control over the man of steel his powers made him such a threat to global security that wonder woman was forced to kill him after questioning him under the lasso of truth confirmed that his death was the only way to free superman when the character was resurrected following blackest night in the story justice league generation lost he prepared to erase the world s memories of his past criminal actions in order to survive the trauma to his brain he placed his body in a large tub of ice and hooked himself up to a blood transfusion machine the life entity somehow changed his abilities and would initially convert living people into the corpses of a black lantern 50 with his task completed lord was now fully restored he then exhibited voluntary activation and control over every resting o m a c infected within the global populace 51 following a company wide reboot lord was reintroduced as part of the dc rebirth publishing event now having been a metahuman since his youth his primary power is tweaked to a form of powerful psychic persuasion which works best when paired with a vocal command in this later depiction his powers work by exploiting and promoting people s underlying desires and inhibitions to make them do his bidding the only draw back being his power does not give him outright control over them as he can only push them to act on their own subconscious wants 52 for example he could draw out deadshot s subconscious desire to kill his daughter so that he could be free to kill anyone but when he used his power on killer frost he only drew out her desire to make a difference other versions edit earth one edit in wonder woman
