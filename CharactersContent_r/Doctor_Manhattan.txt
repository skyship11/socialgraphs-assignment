published by dc comics he debuted in the graphic novel limited series watchmen doctor manhattan was created by writer alan moore and artist dave gibbons the watchmen series is noted for addressing metaphysical issues and questions doctor manhattan being the primary exponent he is often used as an example of a post human god the reception of the character is positive and he has appeared and been mentioned in various forms of media doctor manhattan later appeared in the before watchmen comic book prequel with his individual issue miniseries in 2016 as part of dc comics rebirth relaunch manhattan became a major character in the dc universe he was revealed to be responsible for the flashpoint event creating the new 52 timeline universe in the process a factor that removed 10 years of history of the dc characters 1 this led him to become one of the main characters in the doomsday clock miniseries published from 2017 to 2019 2 doctor manhattan made his first live action debut in the 2009 film watchmen played by billy crudup he also appeared in the 2019 limited television series watchmen played by yahya abdul mateen ii in his original form played by darrell snedeger contents 1

original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat however the writer found he could do more with manhattan as a supreme super hero than he ever could have with captain atom moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum mechanics in constructing the character of dr manhattan the writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time from a linear perspective which would influence the character s perception of human affairs moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like spock from star trek so he sought for dr manhattan to retain human habits and to grow away from them and humanity in general gibbons had created the blue character rogue trooper and reused the blue skin motif for doctor manhattan as it resembles skin tonally but with a different hue moore incorporated color into the story and gibbons noted the rest of the comic s color scheme made manhattan unique 3 moore recalled that he was unsure if dc would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude which partially influenced how they portrayed the character 4 gibbons wanted to tastefully depict manhattan s nudity selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him understated genitals like a classical sculpture so the reader would not initially notice it 5 dr manhattan s forehead is marked with the atomic structure of hydrogen which he put on himself declining a helmet with the atom symbol fictional character biography edit origins edit jonathan osterman is born in 1929 to a german american family jon plans to follow in his father s footsteps as a watchmaker but when the u s drops the atomic bomb on hiroshima his father declares his profession outdated and instead forces him to work toward a career studying nuclear physics the incident represents the turning point in jon s potential future from watchmaker to nuclear physicist and foreshadows doctor manhattan s exterior perception of time as predetermined and all things within it as so determined including manhattan s own reactions and emotions jon attends princeton university and graduates with a ph d in atomic physics in early 1959 he moves to a research base at gila flats where experiments are being performed on the intrinsic fields of physical objects which if tampered with result in their disintegration here he meets janey slater a fellow researcher they eventually become lovers during a visit to an amusement park in new jersey janey s wristwatch is broken which jon promises to fix however one month later jon discovers he has left the repaired watch in his labcoat inside a test chamber while he is inside the test chamber the door closes and locks the researchers are unable to open the door or override the countdown and jon s body is torn to pieces from the force of the generator in the following months a series of strange events and apparitions occur at the research base leading residents to speculate that the area is haunted it becomes apparent that jon is progressively re forming himself during this time as indicated by a series of partial bodily reappearances first a disembodied nervous system including the brain and eyes then as a circulatory system and then as a partially muscled skeleton each time the appearance lasts for only a few seconds jon eventually fully reappears as a tall muscular hairless naked blue skinned man glowing with a flare of ultraviolet before watchmen edit jon gradually becomes a pawn of the u s government which gives him the code name doctor manhattan a reference to the manhattan project and a costume which he begrudgingly accepts doctor manhattan chooses as his emblem a representation of a hydrogen atom whose simplicity he declares to be something that kindles his respect accordingly he painlessly burns the mark into his forehead this preference for material mechanisms marks the beginning of his declining humanity which is progressively mirrored by his gradual shedding of the uniform by the end of the 1970s he refuses to wear anything at all except during mandatory public appearances however manhattan s presence tips the balance of the cold war in the west s favor and u s foreign policy becomes more militaristic as a result at president richard nixon s request he secures an american victory in the vietnam war one week after manhattan s direct involvement which subsequently allows nixon to repeal the 22nd amendment and serve up to five terms moreover far from solving the problems underlying international tensions manhattan s presence exacerbates them while stifling their expression which inevitably builds toward disaster the entire plot of watchmen occurs during the countdown to a potential nuclear war since he works for the u s government manhattan is exempt from a federal law outlawing costumed heroes but spends much of his time conducting research he is single handedly responsible for the shift to electric powered vehicles and adrian veidt credits him with causing a huge leap forward in a myriad of science and technology sectors as a result the technology of the alternative 1985 of the watchmen universe is far more advanced during the only meeting of the crimebusters group manhattan becomes attracted to laurie juspeczyk the second silk spectre his relationship with janey ends acrimoniously shortly after and he begins dating laurie events of watchmen edit at the start of watchmen manhattan works at the rockefeller military research center where he lives with laurie rorschach comes to inform the two of the murder of edward blake aka the comedian and warns them that all former costumed adventurers are being targeted by a mask killer manhattan dismisses rorschach by teleporting him outside and encourages laurie to go out with dan dreiberg the second nite owl shortly afterwards manhattan attends blake s funeral with veidt and dreiberg reflects on his association with blake during the vietnam war and senses the presence of the former villain moloch during an appearance on a talk show a reporter ambushes manhattan with allegations that he caused cancer in his former associates including janey seeking solitude he transports himself to mars the soviet union exploits his absence by invading afghanistan and sparking an international crisis eventually manhattan brings laurie to mars to discuss why he should aid humanity an argument laurie inadvertently wins when she realizes to her shock that her father is blake a man she despised for sexually assaulting her mother from this revelation manhattan is amazed by the improbable chances that occurred to result in the birth of laurie a chain of events he sees as a stunning thermodynamic miracle realizing that by extension this miracle can apply to any living thing on earth manhattan is persuaded to return to earth to protect humanity rather than disregarding it as insignificant veidt is found to have framed manhattan as part of his overall plot to avert world war iii by attacking new york with an engineered monster killing half of the city in the process although manhattan and laurie return too late to stop veidt they teleport to his base in antarctica to confront him veidt tries to disintegrate manhattan only for manhattan to restore himself more quickly than veidt expected however upon seeing that veidt s plan has averted war manhattan realizes that exposing him would be too dangerous for life on earth and agrees to stay silent rorschach leaves with the intention of exposing the truth causing manhattan to vaporize him manhattan decides to depart earth again suggesting that he desires to find a galaxy less complicated than this one when veidt asks if his plan worked out in the end manhattan replies in the end nothing ends adrian nothing ever ends in the dc universe edit the new 52 and dc rebirth edit after departing from the watchmen universe manhattan was aware of the dc universe being filled with hope inside humanity and traveled there to find a place among those people and start a new life but at some point his visions showed him an arms race among metahumans that caused an incoming world war iii leading manhattan to have a confrontation with superman and then he saw nothing 6 this revelation led manhattan to modify the dc universe s mainstream timeline to fix the fissures caused by the several crises across the multiverse unaware it was the doing of perpetua to free herself from the source wall however those actions would not get the expected result and would lead to the creation of the new 52 7 during the events of flashpoint manhattan deceived pandora into convincing barry allen to merge three separate timelines the dc universe the wildstorm universe and select vertigo titles in order to create prime earth 7 the merger enabled him to erase ten years from the reverted universe which not only reversed the age of its inhabitants by ten years but also caused the multiple resurrections of several deceased characters 8 in the new timeline manhattan prevents the last wizard of the council of eternity from revealing to pandora how to open the skull shaped box 9 and kills owlman and metron after the former tries to access the secrets of the universe 10 however the convergence caused by brainiac and telos restored the multiverse bringing back the pre flashpoint timeline 11 doctor manhattan used abra kadabra to trap wally west within the speed force and this modification in the timeline also caused the other speedsters jesse quick bart allen jay garrick and max mercury to be removed from history and trapped in the speed force however wally west was saved by barry therefore initiating the events of dc rebirth doctor manhattan then kills pandora after she finally realizes that he was the one responsible for all of the sins for which she had been blamed 8 barry and batman later began investigating the unknown force behind these changes 12 learning from lilith clay that manhattan was a prominent thought in kadabra s mind when he claimed responsibility for removing wally from history 13 eobard thawne attacks batman as he is studying a blood stained smiley face button left embedded within the wall of the batcave when thawne picks up the button he is briefly teleported away returning with the left half of his body charred to the bone just before his death he claims to have seen god 14 using the cosmic treadmill to chase after the radiation emitted from the button among the timestream batman and barry discover thawne as he was trying to reach god upon reaching the unseen figure thawne boosted his ability to exist as a paradox before he was vaporized by manhattan leaving only the button behind sometime later manhattan picks up the button as he recalls his dialogue with laurie 15 manhattan puts bruce wayne in contact with the flashpoint thomas wayne who tells his son not to become batman before his death and the destruction of the last of the flashpoint timeline 16 prompting bruce not to respond to the bat signal the following night manhattan also saves jor el from the destruction of krypton before conditioning him to see only the very worst of humanity 17 jor el assumes the identity of mister oz and tries to convince his son kal el or superman to abandon earth however when jor el begins to realize that he has been pushing against his son too far he is pulled away superman acknowledges jor el s warnings even as he rejects his misanthropy 18 all of which were to test the will and hope of the two major heroes of the dc universes during the events of heroes in crisis batman suspects that the massacre on sanctuary might be related to manhattan s actions 19 this theory was later proven to be partially true as wally gets in contact with metron s mobius chair which grants him part of manhattan s powers 20 events of doomsday clock edit during the events of doomsday clock seven years after the events set in the watchmen universe ozymandias adrian veidt is determined to find doctor manhattan to restore the world from chaos after his previous plan for world peace was exposed by rorschach s journal 21 veidt narrates that he is able to track doctor manhattan because doctor manhattan leaks electrons as his intrinsic field was stripped during his initial accident and an event caused by veidt using the owlship to quantum tunnel accompanied by rorschach ii marionette and mime veidt follows the electron trail left by doctor manhattan to the dc universe where they land in gotham city 22 later it is revealed that doctor manhattan is responsible for preventing the comedian s death by teleporting him to the dc universe 23 doctor manhattan recalls various events in which he indirectly killed alan scott and thus brought about changes in the timeline on july 16 1940 alan scott was riding on a train over a collapsing bridge but he survived by grabbing onto a green lantern he continues his life eventually sitting at a round table wearing a mask and later testifying before the house un american activities committee but refusing to implicate anyone in his employ on july 16 1940 again doctor manhattan moves the green lantern six inches out of his reach so that alan scott dies in the train accident and leaves no family behind as the green lantern is passed through different locations at a fun house in the present time bubastis ii begins glowing so ozymandias moves him closer to the lantern to let him feed on doctor manhattan s temporal energies left on the lantern and thereby force doctor manhattan to their current location doctor manhattan immediately proceeds to transport himself and the watchmen group away separating them from batman and joker he tells ozymandias that he isn t returning to their world as he s in the middle of something he reveals that he didn t kill marionette in the robbery years back because he saw what her child would do and that she is pregnant again he also reveals that ozymandias lied to rorschach about having cancer so ozymandias admits to rorschach that he deceived him and used him for his help doctor manhattan then tells everyone that he came to the dc universe looking for a place among them but that he saw a vision of the most hopeful among them heading toward him now hopeless and then nothing in the future thereafter doctor manhattan returns the team to the fun house he returns to mars reflecting on a vision set one month in his future a confrontation with superman that may result in superman destroying doctor manhattan or doctor manhattan destroying everything 24 on mars looking at a legion ring that once belonged to ferro lad doctor manhattan contemplates the events in which ferro lad sacrificed his life to save earth s sun and thereby caused his ring to careen through time the events in which he moved alan scott s lantern and thereby caused the ring never to have existed as well as his confrontation with superman set one week from then on earth batman and superman are recovering from a massive explosion which has produced a fog of tachyon particles that obscures the immediate past and future to doctor manhattan meanwhile after tracing the energy signature of the explosion to mars many of earth s superheroes travel in several spaceships to mars for a confrontation with the suspected perpetrator however batman believes that they are being played as he is unsure if they have the right person with the heroes surrounding doctor manhattan martian manhunter telepathically broadcasts doctor manhattan s final vision of superman to everyone the heroes believe that doctor manhattan is trying to destroy superman and all of them before superman destroys him as doctor manhattan easily deals with the attacks by the heroes he curiously examines and discloses the nature of the emotional spectrum by dissecting guy gardner s power ring and stating that the magic used by the justice league dark is from the scraps of creation to prove the point that even hope decays he shows ronnie raymond that professor martin stein purposely caused the circumstances where raymond and stein merged into firestorm to learn more about metahumans from the inside back on mars refusing to believe the events of the past that were shown firestorm attacks and harms doctor manhattan upon which the heroes realize that doctor manhattan is not invulnerable and destroy him however the superheroes watch in shock as doctor manhattan reconstitutes himself before he attacks and incapacitates them 25 as he incapacitates the remaining heroes doctor manhattan recounts the first time he arrived in the dc universe on april 18 1938 he meets carver colman as they talk in a diner doctor manhattan sees all moments of carver s future until his death prior to april 19 1955 overhearing news of a mysterious man who lifted a car over his head doctor manhattan leaves and witnesses the first appearance of the golden age superman from there he witnesses the beginnings of alan scott green lantern jay garrick the flash hawkman atom doctor fate sandman spectre and hourman and the formation of the justice society of america doctor manhattan then sees a different timeline where superman was never a member of the jsa and first appeared in 1956 instead silver age earth 1 doctor manhattan witnesses several variations of the death of superman s foster parents jonathan and martha kent the origins of superman and also when a young superboy met the legion of super heroes to appease his curiosity doctor manhattan moves the green lantern away from alan scott preventing the creation of the green lantern and the formation of the jsa to see how the changes affect superman in doing this doctor manhattan realizes that this universe is not part of the multiverse but is the metaverse with the multiverse reacting to the changes within this universe hence why there have been endless parallel worlds none at all 52 universes and a dark multiverse having changed history in the metaverse doctor manhattan created the new 52 universe and as he witnesses the first appearance of the new 52 superman he is confronted by wally west of the pre flashpoint universe who briefly escapes the speed force to warn him that he knows what doctor manhattan did and that the heroes of the dc universe will stop him before being dragged back into the speed force doctor manhattan likens wally s appearance to the metaverse fighting back at the changes done to it an innate hope that fights back to the surface he returns to carver colman on june 8 1954 10 seconds before he is killed by his mother and he thinks upon the future he sees where superman attacks him believing that he will either die by superman s hands or destroy the metaverse back to present day doctor manhattan returns to earth and ponders that he is a being of inaction on a collision course with a man of action superman and to this universe of hope he has become the villain 26 after arriving on earth manhattan meets superman in person during black adam s invasion on the white house with ozymandias watching 27 manhattan witnesses superman s fight with black adam and russia s superhero team called the people s heroes he eventually reveals to superman that he is the one who has been tampering with reality and that he also caused the death of jonathan and martha kent manhattan expects superman to attack him but superman instead protects him from pozhar and then tells him that he should use his powers for good manhattan is inspired by superman s heroism and his pivotal role in the fabric of reality he undoes part of his actions restoring much of the pre new 52 timeline many characters are brought back into existence including superman s parents manhattan also goes back in time and changes carver colman s future for the better he then goes back to the watchmen universe bringing rorschach and ozymandias with him manhattan saves his earth by making all nuclear weapons disappear afterwards he takes mime and marionette s infant son with him and proceeds to raise him on his own so he will become their planet s equivalent to superman his final thought wanders to what his life could have been if he had not become doctor manhattan janey convinces him to not retrieve the watch so he is not involved in the incident that would have given him his powers he marries janey and they start a family together having two daughters and a son living a life without any worry of time he smiles one last time believing it to be a nice daydream to live in doctor manhattan then erases himself from existence transferring his lifeforce to the planet and his powers to mime and marionette s son he leaves the boy whom he has named clark to be adopted by the former nite owl and silk spectre 28 after doomsday clock edit this article may require copy editing for grammar style cohesion tone

connective energy and after he restored the dc universe 28 the quintessence s members used that same energy against perpetua the batman who laughs has wally prisoner to get manhattan s powers but wonder woman suggests to use both the connective and crisis energies to create an anti crisis the event also features the final bruce wayne an amalgamated version of batman and doctor manhattan created when an alternate batman tried to track manhattan and ended up recreating the accident that gave jon his powers the batman who laughs was able to capture this alternate and extract his brain before he could properly harness his powers allowing the batman who laughs to transplant himself into the body transforming the villain into the darkest knight with the goal of creating a multiverse consisting of chaos 29 characterization edit appearance edit doctor manhattan s body is humanoid and his build tall and muscular his height and relative size vary depending on his needs but generally remains above 1 83 m 6 0 ft tall he is completely blue altering his shade and luminosity at will and has no hair on his forehead he has etched a stylized image of a hydrogen atom he did this during preparations by the military for his unveiling to the general public they presented him with a hat as a part of his uniform that had a group of crossed ellipses on it intended to look like an atom but jon did not see the resemblance he replaced it with a symbol of his own saying that if he were to have a symbol it should at least be one that he respects as doctor manhattan his costume started out as a black leotard which presumably he created as time progressed the costume shrank progressively to a pair of shorts then a brief then a thong he eventually went on to wear nothing at all since he had become indifferent to the need for clothing the only purpose his original costume served was to make those around him including the general public more comfortable before the experiment jon osterman was a human of average height he had brown hair and brown eyes as a physicist he often wore a suit personality edit dr manhattan though supremely powerful suffers from a decreasing ability to relate to normal humans perhaps due to his perception of time and realisation of the deterministic universe he begins to show symptoms of apathy from his radically altered perspective almost all human concerns appear pointless and without obvious merit he describes laurie as his only remaining link to humanity this is demonstrated when the relationship ends and doctor manhattan leaves earth this is also due to evidence coming to light that a number of those who were once close to him including his former girlfriend janey slater have come down with terminal cancer manhattan feels that he poses a threat to others and he exiles himself to mars stating i am tired of earth these people i m tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives his interest in humanity is revived after he witnesses laurie s epiphany that she is the daughter of the comedian it causes him to reflect on the sheer chance that life should come to be in any form but after the watchmen fail to prevent ozymandias s destruction of new york he departs earth commenting that he may explore new life in other parts of the galaxy in dc rebirth 1 pandora accuses her killer currently thought to be doctor manhattan of believing in skepticism doubt and corruption proclaiming that he cannot understand the hope personified in the heroes of the dc universe and that they will prove him wrong his meddling with the dc universe to satisfy his own curiosity shows extreme apathy he s altered the timeline so much that several events and people were altered or wiped out however thanks to the convergence wally west and superman much of the damage was undone though manhattan wasn t deterred from continuing his experiment he erased the golden age by preventing alan scott from getting his powers and helping form the jsa no jsa to inspire clark to be superboy meant no legion existed either he remained indifferent to a survivor who avoided erasure in the last watchmen issue manhattan claimed that nothing ends despite ozymandias succeeding in his plan for world peace but in doomsday clock manhattan withdrew from what he previously said after witnessing the dc universe s citizens losing their own faith in their heroes now affirming that everything ends his sole interest was in the moment superman was to punch at him a moment he couldn t see past in irony manhattan was the antithesis of superman being a human who had lost all senses of humanity while superman was an alien who embodied the best of humanity when the foretold moment came manhattan revealed he was responsible for erasing superman s loved ones however he was shocked that the punch was meant to knock away a villain behind him superman sought only to help and be better which manhattan saw as the answer the entire dc multiverse created new worlds for superman to be born in every era until the 31st century where his ideals brought peace after resorting the jsa and legion manhattan decided his world and multiverse could use someone like superman but manhattan himself was too detached from his humanity so he would need to raise a child and impart his powers to him to this end he raises clark maez mime and marionette s son before leaving him to be adopted by his former teammates powers and abilities edit jon is the only character in watchmen to possess superpowers throughout watchmen he is shown to be absolutely powerful and invulnerable to all harm even when his body is disintegrated he can reconstruct it in a matter of seconds and remains unharmed he is capable of altering his size depending on his needs for example reconstructing himself in a much bigger form he can hurl huge objects effortlessly with his hands he is also unable to exhaust himself jon has complete awareness of and control over atomic and subatomic particles he is also an omnikinetic he does not need air water food or sleep and is immortal he can teleport himself and others over limitless distances he is also capable of true flight although he uses only levitation in most of his appearances due to his perception of time he sees his past present and future simultaneously jon is able to phase any part of his body through solid objects without damaging them produce multiple copies of himself which function independently of each other project destructive energy disintegrate people create force fields transmute create and destroy matter move objects without physically touching them telekinesis reverse entropy repair anything no matter how damaged and he suggests create life he also claims to have walked on the surface of the sun at one point it is stated that in the event of a nuclear war he would be capable of destroying soviet nuclear missiles while at the same time destroying large areas of russia as a result of these capabilities jon becomes central to the united states cold war strategy of deterrence he is also capable of manipulating reality as he sees fit through the use of time manipulation as seen when he erased ten years from the dc universe when barry allen tried to bring his original universe back to normal jon s intervention caused the new 52 timeline to be formed within which most superheroes are younger and less experienced and most of them lose their most important relationships before they begin however despite his immense power he was unable to erase or permanently kill eobard thawne the reverse flash in the dc universe manhattan s power is revealed to be connective energy the opposite to crisis energy scientific accuracy edit in the 2009 film adaptation watchmen physics professor james kakalios of the university of minnesota was used as a scientific consultant and shed light on the potential scientific explanations of doctor manhattan s powers both in the film and the comic cherenkov radiation inspired doctor manhattan s appearance in the 2009 film adaptation kakalios explained that the intrinsic field has basis in reality in that it is a representation of a collection of the electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces kakalios explained that if a being were able to manipulate matter such a being would have complete control over these three forces hence the intrinsic field would exist kakalios also explained that while it is unlikely doctor manhattan s teleportation abilities seemingly could be achieved through quantum tunnelling should doctor manhattan have control over his probability wave functions philosophical implications edit the character of doctor manhattan is one that invokes thought on the philosophy of metaphysics there are various themes addressed throughout the watchmen series from philosophy of time and eternalism to determinism and its relationship to ethics to addressing questions such as what does it mean to be human and do the ends justify the means the character is primarily cited as the representation of the potential side effects and dangers of a superintelligence which include detachment from the rest of humanity and potentially characteristics of apathy 30 in other media edit television edit doctor manhattan appears in watchmen motion comic where he along with every other character in the series is voiced by tom

parallel world 33 this character is named captain adam and appears in superman beyond 1 he is blue skinned and has the hydrogen atom mark of doctor manhattan and is addicted to drugs which keep his quantum senses in check when he is off the drugs he becomes very similar to doctor manhattan in demeanor and powers duplicating himself hundreds of times over to repair the bleed starship and allow the various supermen to pilot the thought robot armor which itself is confirmed to grant one powers capable of beating captain adam however even when he is using his full potential without the aid of
