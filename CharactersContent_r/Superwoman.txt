is a story in action comics 60 3 by jerry siegel and george roussos where lois lane dreams that she has gained superpowers from a blood transfusion from superman and launches a career as superwoman 4 a 1947 superman 45 march april 1947 comic revisits the theme in a story titled lois lane superwoman in which a pair of fraudulent magicians cast a spell on lane making her believe she has superpowers circumstances force superman to play along with the ruse temporarily by using super speed to invisibly intervene in lane s adventures to support the illusion she briefly sports a costume modeled on superman s before the spell is broken a story from action comics has lois actually gaining superpowers from one of lex luthor s inventions and launching a short lived career as superwoman 5 later stories sporadically feature tales in which lois gains superpowers and functioned as a superwoman of sorts but all of these are like the 1951 tale temporary the powers always wear off by the end of the story a typical example of this is the turnabout powers from superman family 207 may june 1981 where the earth two lois lane gains powers from her husband the earth two superman through the unexpected effect of an exotic extraterrestrial plant superman brings into their home the plant s death reverses the effect another example is the batman superman world s finest mini series where mr mxyzptlk briefly transforms lois into a superwoman with costume and powers at the end of all star superman 2 lois lane is presented with a formula called exo genes created by superman that allows her to have his powers for 24 hours and she becomes superwoman during her adventures with her new kryptonian powers 6 she is wooed by two superhumans named samson and atlas and she is captured by a time ultrasphinx her powers fade away at the end of the day her costume seems to be exactly the same as that of the anti matter universe s superwoman but in superman s colors both outfits were designed by frank quitely in other pre crisis imaginary stories set outside the main dc continuity within an alternate history or hypothetical future lois lane gains superpowers in one of these sam lane is a scientist and astrophysicist he discovers that earth s sun will go nova and obliterate the solar system sam and his wife ella place their infant daughter lois in a starship and send her to krypton within a power beam that enables ftl travel and permanently modifies the baby s molecular biology this gives lois super powers after she reaches her adopted world once there adopted and raised as kandi khan lois becomes a zookeeper s daughter in kryptonville like superman in mainstream dc continuity kandi lois establishes a superhero career and like lois and superman in the mainstream continuity supermaid and kal el fall for one another like superman in the mainstream dc continuity supermaid was also vulnerable to fragments of her perished homeworld earthite in this version of events 7 another imaginary story has clark kent and lois exchange places so that she is from krypton and kent is an ordinary human inquisitive about whether or not lois lane was krypton girl s secret identity in 2016 lois again became superwoman in the dc rebirth initiative and appeared as superwoman in the comic book series superwoman the series marks the first ongoing comic book series featuring the superwoman character in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline lois and lana gained superpowers due to the solar energy explosion caused by the death of the new 52 superman this results in both lois and lana becoming superwoman with lois possessing all of superman s powers while lana has the ability to absorb solar energy and release it in other forms lois was later seemingly killed in a similar fashion to the new 52 superman while fighting a female bizzaro luma lynai edit main article luma lynai a woman from the distant planet of staryl luma lynai wins the heart of superman just as superman derives his powers from a yellow sun luma derived her gifts of super strength and flight from an orange sun their romance does not last as luma becomes deathly ill under the rays of a yellow sun and superman cannot leave earth undefended she physically resembles an adult kara zor el with a similar costume except instead of being blue and red with a pentagonal s shield luma s costume is white and green with a circular s emblem superwoman crime syndicate of america s analogue of wonder woman edit it has been suggested that this section be split out into

weaponry lasso of submission earth 3 version of the lasso of truth a weaponized tiara and a magical sword superwoman is the name of several fictional characters who are supervillains appearing in stories published by dc comics all are evil or corrupted alternate universe counterparts of wonder woman superwoman first appeared in justice league of america 29 august 1964 alongside the rest of the crime syndicate of america 8 pre crisis version edit in 1964 an evil counterpart of wonder woman from a parallel universe named superwoman was introduced this superwoman was a member of the crime syndicate of america a villainous counterpart of the justice league of america from the parallel world of earth three vs the justice league s world of earth one superwoman like wonder woman was an amazon and possessed similar powers of super strength and flight unlike most all other versions her golden lasso could change shape into any form she desired including a giant winged serpent the crime syndicate first came to earth one when they felt they were becoming soft without a real challenge to their powers ultraman discovered earth one after gaining the power to gaze between worlds from exposure to a hunk of kryptonite wonder woman defeated superwoman on earth 1 and black canary defeated her on earth 2 and tied her up in her lasso like the other jsa members black canary is transported to earth 3 when superwoman accuses her of unfair advantage due to a vibratory force that power ring had placed in their bodies in the showdown on earth 2 superwoman was defeated again by wonder woman the crime syndicate were defeated and imprisoned between earth one and two by green lantern in a green bubble volume issue needed later the crime syndicate were freed by the time travelling villain per degaton after he was caught up in a time storm discovered their bubble and freed them they tried to get him but he revealed he had made sure he and his time machine would vibrate at a different speed to them meaning they could not touch him they helped him change history and conquer earth 2 by stealing nuclear missiles from the cuban missile crisis of earth prime and when the syndicate betrays him they are sent to 1982 of earth 1 as he had made sure this would happen when they touched him they materialized on the jla s satellite headquarters and defeated the heroes the jsa were imprisoned in their prison but the combined powers of starman and doctor fate got them out they helped him again when the jla tried to restore history though were planning to betray him when degaton was defeated this timeline was erased and the syndicate was re imprisoned in the pre crisis dcu any amazon seen without her nonremovable indestructible bracelets was in fact driven mad superwoman was never seen with bracelets and this was part of her look to show she was in fact an evil aging amazon she also had a streak of grey hair on the original pre crisis earth three superwoman and lois lane are two separate people with lois working as a reporter for the daily star just like earth two and even having a short lived romance with captain comet when he came to her universe while chasing the secret society of super villains across multiple realities the pre crisis version of superwoman was killed along with the rest of the csa when they were trying to save earth three from being destroyed by the anti monitor s antimatter wave 9 during the convergence storyline superwoman was on death row after an accidental death happened to the earth three version of bruno mannheim during the attack on earth three s metropolis due to the rogue hunter s interference the crime syndicate failed to rescue superwoman from death row as the electric chair was activated 10 she however later got better and fought her justice league 1 000 000 counterpart post crisis antimatter version edit the antimatter superwoman art by frank quitely in post crisis continuity as established in the 2000 graphic novel jla earth 2 by grant morrison superwoman and the rest of the crime syndicate comes from a parallel world similar to earth but located in an antimatter universe also home to the planet qward 8 superwoman continues to make occasional appearances as a member of the crime syndicate most recently appearing in storylines in the justice league and superman comics unlike her pre crisis counterpart her magic lasso doesn t change shape but releases the inhibitions of anyone tied to it just as wonder woman s compels victims to tell the truth bizarrely she also possesses heat vision as superman and ultraman do although there is no explanation for this taking the alias lois lane superwoman is an amazon by birth and has risen through the ranks to become the chief editor of the daily planet in what she calls patriarch s world this disguise resembles wonder woman s secret identity of diana prince at the planet superwoman is shown to upset her colleagues the antimatter cat grant refers to superwoman as queen bitch 11 and negatively alludes to her friendship with the antimatter jimmy olsen in her later appearances it is stated that prior to taking on lois lane s identity superwoman was born on damnation island presumably the antimatter counterpart to themyscira or paradise island it is mentioned that she had murdered all of her fellow amazons and upon meeting donna troy she becomes ecstatic over the prospect of being able to murder another one of her kind for the first time in years 12 the antimatter universe s version of superwoman is the first version of the character to combine diana of themyscira and lois lane jimmy olsen is the only civilian who knows of superwoman s secret identity a compliant sexual deviant he does what she tells him in exchange for the favor of watching when she changes her outfit and receiving pieces of it for his disguise kit he is so besotted that he ignores her gibes and insults even when she tauntingly refers to him as superwoman s snitch jimmy olsen and prints it in the planet also in the earth 2 story her lover ultraman hates superwoman s frigidity towards him meanwhile she is carrying on a torrid affair with owlman and they sneak trysts whenever they feel ultraman is not watching however from his floating fortress the antimatter counterpart to the fortress of solitude ultraman doesn t hesitate to fire warning bursts of heat vision towards them whenever he catches them together 8 52 and countdown incarnation edit in 52 week 52 a recreation of earth 3 was shown as a part of the new multiverse in the depiction were characters that are altered versions of the original justice society of america including wonder woman the character is not identified in 52 13 but later in countdown to final crisis which identifies her as superwoman of the crime society of america on an alternative world which is a reversed version of earth 2 based on comments by grant morrison this alternate universe is not the pre crisis earth three making this a new character unrelated to previous versions 14 grant morrison also suggests that the earth 3 and antimatter superwomen both exist post 52 like the antimatter iteration of the character she is indeed both a lois lane and wonder woman counterpart despite possessing kryptonian abilities such as heat vision in countdown she is recruited into the monarch s army but has her eyes gouged out by red robin jason todd of new earth who may or may not have been carrying kryptonite the new 52 incarnation edit superwoman lois lane the new 52 earth 3 following dc s 2011 reboot event the new 52 characters from earth 3 are again revised beginning in 2013 comics superwoman once again the alternate version of both lois lane and wonder woman is one of the members of the crime syndicate to arrive from earth 3 at the conclusion of the trinity war event 15 during the forever evil storyline superwoman and owlman raid arkham asylum where they end up capturing nightwing during the crime syndicate s broadcast superwoman reveals nightwing s identity on the broadcast 16 while grid looks over the biographies of the other syndicate members he finds that while data on the other members are there superwoman s were deleted leaving her true past and identity still a total mystery she is also pregnant and engaging in affairs with both owlman and ultraman 17 it was finally revealed that superwoman is in a relationship with the crazed alexander luthor of earth 3 who uses the power of the lightning and goes by the name mazahs she betrays ultraman revealing she and luthor are carrying a child who is prophesied to bring an end to the world after mazahs is killed by the luthor of the main universe superwoman is placed in captivity immune to wonder woman s lasso of truth wonder woman attempts traditional interrogation of her counterpart about the entity that destroyed their world but superwoman does not reveal any information just then she ends up announcing the baby it kicked 18 during the darkseid war storyline superwoman is freed from a r g u s custody by the justice league in order to help the justice league deal with the anti monitor 19 during the battle with the new gods superwoman starts to give birth right after she gave birth to her son on order from owlman superwoman used her child to absorb the omega sanction from lex luthor while boasting of her child s strength superwoman was disintegrated by grail who took the baby the baby was subsequently used by grail as a host to resurrect her father darkseid who had been slain by the anti monitor 20 infinite frontier incarnation edit following the reboot of the multiverse after dark nights death metal a new earth 3 and superwoman are created unlike most incarnations this superwoman is an alternate version of donna troy she is the second daughter of queen hippolyta of themyscira also known as demon s island her older sister diana was apparently killed by their mother for weakness donna was trained from birth to be merciless in combat and anticipate any strategy her enemy may use in 1945 a man named steve trevor came to devil s island seeking amazons to act as soldiers in a war that his side was losing donna fell in love with him but refused to leave her home so steve took her hostage and demanded that hippolyta provide warriors for his cause or he would kill donna much to his shock hippolyta simply told donna to save herself which she did stabbing steve in the stomach hippolyta explained that this was donna s final lesson words and emotion could be potent weapons which she would need to master the amazons had anticipated the rise of metahumans in man s world and donna was sent out to infiltrate and gain control over them she plans to one day return home at the head of an army of metahumans kill her mother and take the throne 21 donna became the ambassador to the united states of america from themyscira and she exerts considerable influence over the american government by sexually dominating president oliver queen 22 when the starro collective invades earth owlman develops a strategy to kill the queen starro by sending emerald knight into its brain as the energy from his power battery is extremely painful to it emerald knight fails and the queen responds with a powerful psychic attack on the attacking metahumans turning their emotional vulnerabilities against them superwoman is able to resist the attack and single handedly kills the queen as it begs for mercy 21 gender swapped superman edit superwoman along with batwoman and superlad from superman batman 24 in superman 349 the turnabout trap 23 superman returns from an interstellar mission to find that everyone on earth is of the opposite sex among them are penny white a female perry white jenny olsen a female jimmy olsen louis lane a male lois lane batwoman a female batman rather than the actual character wonder warrior a male wonder woman dc comics could not use the name wonder man at the time because marvel comics holds the trademark black condor a male black canary superlad a male supergirl and superwoman his female counterpart herself believing he crossed into a parallel universe superman flies back to space to find a dimensional portal but is blocked by an invisible barrier he notices the parallelism fails when he sees superwoman and clara kent superwoman s presumed secret identity are two separate people when he confronts superwoman he discovers that he is regarded as a super villain in this gender reversed world which leads to a battle with superwoman superlad and wonder warrior they manage to trap superman with wonder warrior on guard but he manages to escape and takes wonder warrior s magic lasso with him superman figures out that his foe mr mxyzptlk is behind this gender reversed world this was partly due to the discrepancy of clara kent and superwoman being different people however mxyzptlk s biggest mistake was being too vain to give himself a reverse gender counterpart in superwoman s rogues gallery in the daily planet morgue all of superwoman s foes were reverse gender counterparts to superman s foes leslie luthor lex luthor bizaress bizarro and the toywoman toyman except for mxyzptlk superman discovers as well that he was never in a parallel universe but rather on earth which mxyzptlk had altered with his magic after using wonder warrior s magic lasso to make mxyzptlk say his name backwards and thus returning him to his native dimension the effects of mxyzptlk s magic including the existence of superwoman vanish returning the earth to normal upon his return to his clark kent identity he is startled to discover there is still a louis lane but he turns out to be lois lane s cousin later stories including countdown and the multiversity would revisit the concept of a gender reversed superman known as superwoman and designated those stories as taking place on earth 11 of the dc multiverse laurel kent edit a new superwoman named laurel apparently a female version of superman from a parallel earth now identified as earth 11 appeared for the first time in superman batman 23 24 in earth 11 s alternate universe much like in the one featured in the turnabout trap reversed gender characters exist relative to that resident on new earth there is a batwoman female batman superlad male supergirl and a female darkseid known as the dark queen it is notable that in pre crisis continuity laurel kent was the name of a 30th century descendant of superman who occasionally appeared in stories featuring the legion of super heroes and was replaced in continuity by laurel gand in december 2007 superwoman and batwoman were featured in countdown presents the search for ray palmer superwoman batwoman 1 it features earth 11 as part of the new dc multiverse and presents a male version of wonder woman called wonder man who originates from a society of male amazons it also depicts that world s version of amazons attack superwoman kristin wells art by gil kane 1983 the multiversity guidebook released as part of the multiversity showed new versions of the characters from earth 11 more closely resembling new earth after the flashpoint event with equivalent costumes to their new earth counterparts indicating their world had also been affected by the flashpoint storyline though the exact nature of those changes is unrevealed the aquawoman of earth 11 would become a member of justice league incarnate a team which formed as a result of the multiversity event she would go on to help superwoman of earth 11 as well as a number of other superman counterparts to escape from a being called prophecy who was attempting to drain their powers in order to fight an unknown future threat together with aquawoman superman the new super man of china and the justice league incarnate prophecy was defeated and superwoman and the other superman counterparts would return to their worlds and times kristin wells edit another version of superwoman this one a heroic character came about in the form of kristin wells who was created by superman comic writer elliot s maggin wells first appeared in maggin s superman novel miracle monday but he later introduced her in the pages of dc comics presents as superwoman the character wells is a 29th century descendant of jimmy olsen wells time travels to the 20th century where the technology she had brought from the future gives her superpowers it is this iteration of the character which appears briefly in superman whatever happened to the man of tomorrow which creates a continuity problem in that she had already revealed jimmy olsen s final fate to become a great editor like perry white dana dearden edit obsessed superman fan dana dearden dated jimmy olsen to get close to superman and when that didn t work she stole mystic artifacts which granted her the strength of hercules the speed and flight of hermes the thunderbolts of zeus and the sight of heimdall dana donned a green and purple uniform with superwoman written down the leggings and called herself superwoman and tried to get superman to fall in love with her he rejected her advances and jimmy called her obsession she vanished attempting to help superman rescue people from a burning ship 24 the dana dearden superwoman when superman was split into his red and blue energy forms superwoman returned hoping that one of the supermen would return her feelings but maxima intervened and used her telepathy to convince superwoman that she would destroy superman with her love 25 the telepathic illusion wore off and she would try to win superman over again this time in a red and blue costume very similar to his and claimed to be his wife in response to a recent photograph of superman wearing a wedding ring during a subsequent attack of humans using the dmn drug which turned the users into violent demons until the high was over superman convinced her to help him stop the dmn users arguing that if she truly loved him she would help him do his duty rather than attack him for potentially picking someone else over her she died trying to protect him from one of the dmn users when it almost struck him in the back while he was distracted since she knew he was vulnerable to magic 26 lucy lane edit lucy lane first appeared as superwoman in supergirl vol 5 35 january 2009 her costume a nod to that of the bronze age superwoman kristin wells and containing a containment field that simulated kryptonian powers however lucy s identity was not revealed until near the story arc s end during her tenure as superwoman she was blackmailed by her father general sam lane into performing acts of villainy such as murdering agent liberty who had been spying on general lane and lex luthor 27 this resulted in her being the focus of the supergirl faces of evil issue lucy lane new krypton superwoman lucy lane later attacks reactron which tipped off readers that superwoman was not kryptonian since the villain s gold kryptonite power source had no effect on her 28 supergirl unmasks superwoman 29 and accidentally kills her by rupturing the containment field of her suit causing lucy s body to contort and explode 30 in the supergirl annual lucy is brought back to life by the suit as it steals the life of another person the suit is then revealed to be a magical creation of mirabai of the forlorn ally of sam lane who mystically infused in it the genetic abilities of several alien races of kryptonian might when supergirl ruptured it the backlash permanently altered lucy lane into being a composite alien being of human appearance herself with inherent kryptonian abilities 31 this superwoman was last seen as a prisoner after sam lane s machinations during the war of the supermen storyline came to an end though it was hinted she would escape at some point in the future the launch of the new 52 however ended that storyline lana lang edit superwoman 10 july 2017 art by ken lashley when superman died lana lang and lois lane both absorbed energy released from his body and the two women developed superhuman powers lana gained the power to convert solar radiation into various forms of electromagnetic energy while lois developed powers similar to superman s both lana and lois became superwoman after lois death lana became the sole superwoman during superman reborn it was revealed that the powers lois and lana received were the leftover energy from the new 52 superman the post crisis superman took that energy into himself to become an amalgam leaving lana seemingly powerless and confused some energy remained within her suit which was later found to be red kryptonite radiation other uses edit various comic stories pre and post crisis offer glimpses of possible futures assuming that one of the various incarnations of supergirl would eventually change her codename to superwoman upon reaching adulthood one example is the superman family 200 april 1980 in which all the stories are set in the then near future 1999 or 2000 the timeframe is cited only as the turn of the century with the characters aged appropriately including an older linda danvers kara zor el who divides her time between her career as superwoman and serving as governor of florida alternatively some stories assume one of superman s female descendants would assume the name superwoman like his daughter kara and great granddaughter lara from the elseworlds series superman batman generations in other media edit see also lois lane in
