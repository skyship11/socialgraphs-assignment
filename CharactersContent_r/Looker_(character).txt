outsiders set out to rescue emily after a battle with the people of abyssia emily s heritage was revealed to her and as halley s comet passed by the earth she gained her super powers which also had the effect of making her very attractive physically joining the outsiders edit looker s first costume on the cover of outsiders 31 after leaving abyssia to its people emily returned with the outsiders and an astonished husband she soon took on the name lia as well as a more confident yet self centered personality emily s first outing as looker occurred after the outsiders had been captured by the masters of disaster after defeating the masters of disaster she freed the outsiders and was welcomed into their ranks 3 her first tenure with the outsiders showed how much the mousy emily briggs had changed as she became obsessed with her beauty something that usually created some tension between her and katana the tension was only heightened with the budding friendship between looker and halo where the more free spirited looker was in sharp contrast with halo s stricter legal guardian katana looker shows a deep current of intelligence when she defeats an intelligent virus inhabiting her then friend dr helga jace the sentient virus believing that looker was injecting jace with a vaccine to which jace was allergic fled the body and died upon contact with the air the vaccine was in fact harmless glucose and looker herself was already immune because she was not allergic unfortunately jace would later go on to willingly betray the outsiders to the alien manhunters looker s role as somewhat of an outsider amongst outsiders continued to worsen especially when windfall joined a former master of disaster and peer of halo and the two were constantly involved in a rivalry of sorts on top of that looker started a short affair with the team leader geo force during a time that they were stranded on an island but which continued when they returned eventually though there came a mutual decision to call it quits it being unfair not only to gregg looker s husband but also to denise geo force s girlfriend some time later looker received a call for help from abyssia traveling to the underground city looker discovered that abyssia had been taken over looker invoked a challenge on the despot and in the course of the battle she was stripped of her beauty and much of her power
