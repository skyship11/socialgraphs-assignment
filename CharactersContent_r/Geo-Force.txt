girlfriend denise howard since she is not a markovian the marriage is annulled by brion s choice unbeknownst to brion denise later tries to undergo the same experiment which transformed geo force into

speeds for short periods of time his teammate black lightning once remarked that geo force weakens after flying 1 000 miles geo force has demonstrated the ability to manipulate the earth itself in a manner similar to terra brion has shown he can turn organic material to earthen mineral with a touch this ability is not quite explained in the instance where he turns the reanimated corpse of terra to stone 14 geo force possesses impressive superhuman strength speed and durability he once used his gravity manipulation powers to enhance his own super strength strengthening him sufficiently enough

splitting into pieces during the war of the gods 18 reportedly his geokinesis is so powerful that working in conjunction with four other similarly powered individuals geo force could crack the planet in half 19 with the return of these abilities however the level of durability he has seems to fluctuate at one time being slashed by sharp items usually a deep wound triggering this unstable and

drudge up and weaponize molten lava from beneath the earth s surface as well during convergence 22 brion markov has gained his powers due in part to his heritage as a prince of markovia as well as the
