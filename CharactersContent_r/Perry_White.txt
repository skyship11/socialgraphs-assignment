white was created for the radio serial the adventures of superman voiced by actor julian noa he appeared in the second episode clark kent reporter which aired on february 14 1940 he transitioned into the comic books later that year appearing in superman 7 november 1940 in the adventures of superman television series episode crime wave and the post crisis comic continuity he was an award winning journalist who served a term as mayor of metropolis he worked as an assistant editor in the daily star under george taylor before becoming editor in chief of the daily planet 3 his most well known catchphrases are great caesar s ghost and don t call me chief fictional character biography edit golden and silver age edit the earliest superman comics shows clark kent and lois lane working for the newspaper the daily star and an editor named george taylor however this was soon changed with perry white first appearing as the editor of a newly renamed the daily planet 4 in the adventures of superman it was established white had a law degree but had never practiced law journalism having a greater attraction for him 5 in the 1960s and 1970s dc comics after the multiverse method of continuity tracking was implemented the above inconsistency was explained away by declaring that on earth one the silver age universe perry white is clark and lois employer at the daily planet while on earth two the golden age universe george taylor is that world s editor in chief of the daily star the perry white of earth two is a lead reporter for the daily star and according to a superman family tale has filled in as editor from time to time while taylor was away prior to the changes detailed in crisis on infinite earths perry begins his career as a freelance reporter for various newspapers including a chicago newspaper 6 and gotham city s gotham gazette 7 he eventually goes to work at the daily planet as a reporter and earns his first pulitzer prize by being the first to write about superboy s extraterrestrial origins thanks to an exclusive interview with the boy of steel 8 later still perry s reporting skills earn more praise after being the first to discover that superboy has moved to metropolis from smallville superboy had intended to keep his move quiet for an undefined period of time so as not to alert anyone to superboy and clark kent leaving smallville around the same time 9 finally during clark kent s junior year of college perry is promoted to editor in chief of the newspaper after the retirement of the paper s previous editor the earth one version of george taylor 10 in the early 1970s the daily planet is bought by morgan edge president of the media conglomerate galaxy communications with much of perry s power in running the paper overtaken by edge 11 in the months just prior to the crisis reboot in 1985 it is implied that perry white is beginning to succumb to alzheimer s disease manifesting in increased forgetfulness and confusion volume issue needed modern age edit with writer john byrne s post crisis on infinite earths revamp of superman s origin in the man of steel miniseries and his subsequent superman comics perry s history was fleshed out more fully post crisis perry is born in metropolis suicide slum area growing up with a father missing after heading off to war overseas he becomes a copy boy at the daily planet beginning a lifetime career that will take him up the newspaper s career ladder perry goes to school with lex luthor while they are children luthor was also born in suicide slum after luthor becomes a successful businessman he begins diversifying his holdings in his newly founded lexcorp company which includes buying the daily planet luthor soon sells it after deciding to pursue technology and television investments turning down an offer from luthor to become part of luthor s new television station wlex perry finds an investor who saves the daily planet on the condition that perry is promoted from reporter to managing editor the entire episode not the least of which is what perry felt as having been forced out of his active writing career leaves perry bitter and angry with luthor perry marries alice spencer and has a son jerry white much later after jerry is fully grown perry learns that lex luthor is jerry s biological father luthor briefly seduces alice while perry is overseas reporting on a war and thought to be killed perry white s two greatest moves as the editor are hiring of lois lane and later clark kent when she was 15 lois had impressed perry with her persistence in trying to get employment at the newspaper by lying about her age after jerry white dies from a gunshot perry and alice grieve for some time resulting in perry taking a leave of absence from the daily planet later perry and alice adopt an orphaned african american boy named keith robert parks who soon has his name changed to keith robert white at about this time perry takes another leave of absence for lung cancer treatment putting clark kent in charge as the planet s temporary editor after many grueling months of chemotherapy the cancer goes into remission one of perry s proudest moments is attending the wedding of lois and clark he sits in the front row beside lois parents lois considers him as close a relative as her own family 12 as the paper continues to struggle the planet s owner franklin stern sells the paper to lex luthor luthor acting out of pure malice dismantles the paper he fires everyone except lois lane jimmy olsen and two others who are relocated to lexcom lex new internet based news company shortly thereafter lex sells the planet to bruce wayne for 1 thanks to a secret deal with lois lane white is hired back as editor in chief and the entire former staff is hired back as well though perry s knowledge of clark s alter ego is uncertain it is known that he has found a dusty suit of his star reporter s clothes in a supply closet including his passport for this reason perry may well suspect that clark and superman are the same person but due to his personal admiration for both clark and superman he has never confided this suspicion or knowledge to anybody bruce wayne believes that because of white s superior skill as a reporter he knows that clark is superman perry white is too good a reporter not to have uncovered clark s secret and yet he acts otherwise reminding me how good a detective jim gordon is back in gotham city batman hush perry s editorship keeps the daily planet as one of the few newspapers that dare to heavily criticize luthor even after luthor s successful election as president of the united states because of the changes in superman s history in recent years including 2003 2004 s miniseries birthright much is not certain about perry s history in final crisis 2 lois and perry are caught in an apparently fatal explosion triggered by clayface at the daily planet as of final crisis 3 it was revealed that perry is alive but on life support perry has since then recovered however and is now back to running the paper when the world begins to grow increasingly more paranoid towards the new population of kryptonians lois begins to investigate the conspiracies executed by the us government and her father general lane in particular however the government becomes aware of lois actions and attempt to shut her down as a result perry is unable to print any of lois stories because of general lane s power unwilling to let this slide perry suggests that lois quit the paper so as to continue her investigation 13 in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock perry white has changed the name of the article revolving around the superman theory much to the dismay of lois lane at the time when she and clark kent think that someone is pulling the strings behind this theory 14 other versions edit in the limited comic series dc universe online legends perry white was captured alongside lois lane and jimmy olsen in the daily planet by brainiac but was saved by superman with lex luthor in possession of the canister containing them 15 16 later perry became one of the people who has gained metahuman abilities from braniac s exobytes transforming his body into a being of ice and granting him ice powers which has surprised him 17 later he adopted the code name frost 18 in the limited series all star superman perry remains the boss of the daily planet and publishes an article that incriminates lex luthor resulting in his arrest and sentenced execution in the limited series superman red son perry is the editor in chief of the daily planet eventually succeeded by lois luthor in the tie in comic to young justice perry is at bibbo s diner where bibbo comments on the behavior of his other guests but perry doesn t respond five years later perry was at the front door of the daily planet when a spaceship launched a device that hovered over metropolis burrowing into the ground perry walks

of his old reputation by exposing clark s powers but the plan backfires when a random solar flare temporarily nullifies clark s abilities although clark s subsequent heroism despite his currently powerless status prompts perry to both abandon the idea that clark has powers and cause him to consider turning over a new leaf even offering to give clark a recommendation into journalism as a career in future the phrase don t call me chief was worked into this episode when white irritates sheriff nancy adams by calling her chief it s later implied in the season 4 episode gone that perry is

became don t call me sugar when he orders a coffee with sugar and jimmy olsen calls him chief and he tells him not to call him sugar cooper s perry was also fond of aphorisms such as a good reporter doesn t get great stories a good reporter makes them great in the commentary track for superman director richard donner reveals that cooper got the role because he had a passport and thus was able to

in man of steel while his position does not deviate from the comics his view of superman is somewhat different rather than seeing the existence of a powerful alien as a major scoop he believes such a
