was to superman she and her husband zor el send her to a spaceship from argo city to earth to survive 3 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit earth one edit in pre crisis continuity alura supported her husband zor el one of the only scientists to believe his older brother jor el s predictions about the impending destruction of krypton when the planet exploded argo city was somehow blown safely into space with a life giving bubble of air around it a later version of the story in action comics 316 september 1964 has the city saved by a weather dome that zor el had constructed the explosion had turned the ground beneath argo city into kryptonite but alura zor el and the other survivors covered the surface with sheets of lead the kryptonians managed to keep alive for many years and kara was born a number of years after the destruction of krypton the end for argo city came during kara s teens when a meteor storm punched holes into the lead sheeting exposing the survivors to the deadly kryptonite radiation zor el had managed to build a rocket and now used it to send his daughter to earth alura provided kara a costume based closely on superman s own it was later revealed to supergirl through zor el induced dreams that he and alura had teleported away into the survival zone similar to the phantom zone during argo s final moments supergirl was able to rescue them in action comics 310 march 1964 and zor el and alura went on to live in kandor when the bottle city was enlarged zor el and alura resettled on new krypton rokyn earth two edit in the alternate universe of earth two allura in z note different spelling is married to zor l and they send their daughter kara zor l to earth two where she becomes power girl this zor l was an expert in psychology and created a virtual reality chamber for kara inside her spacecraft as she aged inside the rocket on her way to earth two she experienced the type of life she would have had on krypton with allura and zor l zor l and allura were killed when krypton exploded this version of allura lived in kandor and not argo city allura only made one appearance in showcase 98 march 1978 post crisis edit in the supergirl from krypton story arc in superman batman 8 13 may october 2004 alura and zor el rocketed their daughter away from krypton before kal el left it was expected that she would reach earth first and could help raise kal from his infancy however she stayed in stasis and her ship did not reach earth until years later so the infant she expected to help raise was a grown man when she arrived still in her teens after lex luthor uses black kryptonite to split kara into good and evil parts the evil kara claims that zor el actually sent his daughter to earth to kill his nephew since he resented his older brother and hated the idea of jor el s lineage continuing past krypton s destruction this tied together and explained fragmented flashbacks that had suggested zor el was a villainous character including his dismissal of schoolchildren taunting kara as the dead they had already been possessed and alura telling kara to kill her and make your father proud she had also been possessed by phantoms from the phantom zone and this was not a taunt but a genuine request from what remained of her original personality as well as the original idea that he wanted kara to kill kal el as the story ended it was revealed that the house of el was cursed by the phantoms as they saw them as their jailers wherever one of the el blood line went the phantoms would follow to save earth he needed to send kara to remove kal and stop the el blood line from ever growing at the end of this story arc however it was revealed that the images of zor el and the phantoms subsequently invading earth as predicted were all a ruse by the monitors to see if supergirl belonged in the new earth universe upon discovering she was truly that universe s supergirl she was left to her own devices to reconcile with all the people she harmed in the wake of the test the monitor does however assert that the memories of zor el and the phantoms on krypton were nevertheless real a subsequent flashback in issue 24 apparently contradicts the monitor revealing that new earth zor el was not a scientist although alura was in current continuity zor el was a ranger and got on well with his brother with his encouragement alura designed the ship that sent kara to earth as both kal el s protector and the last living being who remembered krypton since kal el was an infant in action comics 869 it is revealed that alura saved argo city from krypton s destruction by engineering a protective dome with her husband zor el however brainiac who was the culprit for krypton s explosion returned to finish the job he merged argo with the bottle city of kandor and killed those he considered to be duplicate information superman finds the city in brainiac s ship zor el and alura are able to make contact with kal el to enquire about their daughter the bottle city of kandor reverts to its full size in the north pole at the end of the brainiac story arc which leads directly into new krypton a rather minor character historically alura has a major role in the on going superman new krypton storyline she is shown not to trust earth people and does not approve of her daughter or nephew s choices zor el is a voice of reason to her and when he is murdered by reactron she is beside herself with grief and anger after zor el s death she takes command over the kandorian people putting as many superman s enemies as she can in the phantom zone and waging war over the human race in retribution for reactron s attack when a coalition of human heroes led by superman manages to stop her plan de powering some of the kryptonian army alura uses kryptonian sunstones to turn kandor into a new planet the so called new krypton and put it into orbit around the sun at the opposite side of earth it is later revealed that she freed general zod to help manage the planet and lead its military as part of his participation in project 7734 a covert u s military operation dedicated to neutralizing the kryptonians luthor sends a robot double of himself with brainiac on an mission to attack new krypton while there the luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously captured reactron 5
