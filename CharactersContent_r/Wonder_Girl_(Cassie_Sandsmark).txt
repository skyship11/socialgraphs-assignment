interest and mentor in stealing and lennox sandsmark a british super soldier who left the family when cassie was only four years old 58 as lennox is a demigod son of zeus and also a half brother of wonder woman cassie for the first time is related to wonder woman 59 rebirth edit in the super sons of tomorrow crossover the version of cassie sandmark from the titans tomorrow future briefly arrived in the present timeline of rebirth alongside other members of the titans of tomorrow in young justice 2 zeus refers to cassie as the future of the pantheon of the gods as part of her birthright zeus offers her a necklace that is said to contain immense powers however cassie decides to hold off on taking this gift until she does something to truly earn it zeus calls her a giant pain just like her mother powers and abilities edit cassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by artemis during her time as wonder woman these included the gauntlet of atlas and the sandals of hermes which provided her with the powers of strength and speed flight respectively 5 she was eventually granted similar abilities by zeus as her fondest wish 7 discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children ares and heracles zeus also blessed cassandra s mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch 7 shortly after joining the teen titans ares approached her and gave cassandra her own magic lasso 13 unlike wonder woman s lasso of truth cassandra s is a weapon which channels zeus lightning when she becomes angry 14 when the greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of the events of infinite crisis taking cassandra s powers along with them ares offered her some of his power saying that she would be more powerful than she s ever been what this entails is not made entirely clear though she appeared to have retained all of her former abilities 30 31 in a storyline taking place one year later cassie was shown catching a falling jet which she was surprised at being able to accomplish 60 however while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother ares causes her powers to fluctuate when he believes she is wasting them on frivolous matters volume issue needed in the end ares was not pleased with cassandra as his champion he returned another to take her place during a battle with ares son king lycus who also drew power from him cassie was able to cast away her connection to the war god and tap into her own powers as a demi god like her brother heracles her real powers increased to an even greater level of strength than before currently having tapped into her own demi goddess powers cassie is an olympian powerhouse although she is not as powerful as wonder woman or donna troy cassie is still a powerful young woman her lasso has apparently also changed enabling her to turn lycus to dust with a simple order cassie was trained by the amazon artemis and is extremely well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts she is also a very capable leader and strategist after the new 52 reboot cassie s powers have changed yet again her powers are now derived from the silent armor that she wears which was forged in the heart of a sun and is apparently related to the demon known as trigon the armor is invisible unless she summons it or is in a combat situation but she is always able to use its powers the armor usually appears as a glittering red bodysuit golden gauntlets and occasionally a hood the armor grants her powers similar to those of her pre reboot counterpart such as superhuman strength sufficient enough for her to be on par with superboy and fight him for a while durability though she is still vulnerable to piercing weapons superhuman reflexes superhuman speed superhuman senses and the power to fly at high speeds the armor also grants her a glowing red lasso that appears similar to barbed wire the lasso is infinite in length is virtually indestructible and can drain the life force out of those wrapped in its confines cassie s armor also appears to have a mind of its own and has taken over her mind and body on a few occasions it was later revealed that cassie has divine heritage as well as her father was revealed to be wonder woman s elder brother lennox cassie discovered she was the granddaughter of zeus and that she still had her powers even without the silent armor because of her divine heritage she was able to resist the silent armor s influence 61 other versions edit in teen titans earth one cassie sandsmark is re
