comics ross wrote a 40 page handwritten outline of what would become kingdom come and pitched the idea to james robinson as a project similar in scope to watchmen 1986 1987 and alan moore s infamous lost work twilight of the superheroes ultimately ross teamed with writer mark waid who was recommended by dc editors due to his strong familiarity with the history of dc superheroes 4 plot edit in this elseworlds story superman and the justice league abandon their roles as superheroes after the rise and strong public support of a superhero named magog who has no qualms about killing notably the joker on his way to trial for the mass murder of the daily planet staff including lois lane in the ensuing years a newer generation of superpowered metahumans arise they engage in destructive battles with little distinction between heroes and villains the narrator minister norman mccay receives apocalyptic visions of the future from a dying wesley dodds the spectre appears to mccay and recruits him to help pass judgment on the approaching superhuman apocalypse an attack on the parasite led by magog goes awry when parasite tears open captain atom as a result much of the american midwest is irradiated killing millions and destroying a large portion of the united states s food production 5 coaxed back into action by wonder woman superman returns to metropolis and re forms the justice league 5 he recruits new and old heroes the most prominent exception is the batman who resents superman for leaving the world 10 years ago batman warns him that his idealist notions are outdated and his violent interference will only exacerbate the world s problems in response to superman s justice league batman activates his own network of agents the outsiders made up largely of younger second and third generation heroes trusted veterans such as green arrow black canary and blue beetle are chosen as lieutenants lex luthor organizes the mankind liberation front the mlf is secretly a group of golden age villains and third generation villains like ra s al ghul s successor ibn al xu ffasch who is bruce wayne and talia al ghul s son the mlf works to take control of the world from the heroes 6 superman s justice league gathers more captives than converts and his prison nicknamed the gulag is quickly filled to capacity superman works to persuade the inmates that their methods are wrong headed and dangerous to no avail with hostile heroes and villains locked up together pressure builds meanwhile superman learns that wonder woman s ardent militant stance may be influenced by her recent exile from paradise island in the eyes of the amazons her mission to bring peace to the outside world has failed and she has thus been stripped of her royalty batman and his outsiders seem to ally themselves with mlf against the justice league luthor s plan is to exacerbate the conflict between the league and gulag s inmates batman quickly discovers that an adult billy batson is under luthor s control batson as captain marvel is the only metahuman capable of matching superman s power when the inmates riot and kill captain comet luthor unwittingly reveals to batman he intends to use the brainwashed batson to break open the gulag batman s forces ambush luthor and his conspirators but are unable to restrain batson who transforms into marvel and flies off while wonder woman leads the justice league to the prison riot superman confronts batman batman tries to justify inaction saying the world would be better off if all the metahumans destroyed each other however superman knows that batman will act because his entire crimefighting life is based upon the desire to prevent the loss of human life 7 moved by superman s sentiments batman tells him that captain marvel is under luthor s control and is on the way to the gulag superman races to the prison but upon arrival is struck down by captain marvel the gulag is breached freeing the population and inciting war between them and the justice league batman s army arrives on site as an intervening third party but is unable to stop wonder woman from killing the supervillain von bach which increases the fury of the riot as conditions worsen united nations secretary general wyrmwood authorizes the deployment of three tactical nuclear warheads hardened against metahumans in the middle of their fight batman and wonder woman see the incoming bombers piloted by the blackhawk squadron they break off fighting and manage to stop two bombs but miss the third captain marvel uses his lightning bolt as a weapon against superman who manages to grab marvel and allow the bolt to transform him into billy holding batson s mouth shut superman tells him he is going to stop the remaining bomb batson must make a choice either stop superman and allow the warhead to kill all the metahumans or let superman stop the bomb and allow the metahumans war to engulf the world superman tells batson he must be the one to decide as he is the only one who lives in both worlds a man as batson and a god as marvel batson his mind now clear of luthor s influence turns back into captain marvel he flings superman to the ground and flies after the missile marvel intercepts the missile and shouts shazam three times in rapid succession detonating the bomb prematurely and killing batson in the process despite marvel s sacrifice most of the metahumans are obliterated in the explosion superman is unharmed but does not realize that there are any other survivors enraged at the tremendous loss of life he flies to the u n building and threatens to kill the delegates as punishment for the massacre the surviving metahumans arrive but mccay is the one who talks him down pointing out how his appearance and behavior are exactly the sort of reasons that normal humans fear the superpowered superman immediately ceases his rampage he is handed captain marvel s cape and tells the u n that he will use his wisdom to guide rather than lead humankind superman ties captain marvel s cape to a flagpole and raises it among the flags of the member nations of the u n suggesting that this role of guidance will be more political and global in nature than the classic crime busting vigilantism of the past 8 in the epilogue the heroes strive to become fully integrated members of the communities wonder woman s exile from paradise island ends she becomes an ambassador for super humanity taking the survivors of the gulag to paradise island for rehabilitation batman abandons his crusade and becomes a healer rebuilding his mansion as a
