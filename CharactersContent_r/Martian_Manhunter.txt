erdel in detective comics 225 november 1955 written by joseph samachson and illustrated by joe certa note 1 the character is a green skinned humanoid from mars who is pulled to earth by an experimental teleportation beam constructed by dr saul erdel the martian tells erdel where he is from and is told that to send him back will require the computer brains thinking plot to be changed the shock of the encounter kills dr erdel and leaves j onzz with no way of returning home the character decides to fight crime while waiting for martian technology to advance to a stage that will enable his rescue 1 to that end he adopts the identity of john jones a detective in the fictional middletown usa 2 during this period the character and his backstory differ in some minor and some significant ways from modern treatments firstly as with his counterpart the silver age superman j onzz s power range is poorly defined and his powers expand over time as the plot demands the addition of precognitive abilities detective comics 226 is quickly followed by telepathy and flight 3 4 atomic vision super hearing 5 and many other powers in addition his customary weakness to fire is only manifested when he is in his native martian form a more significant difference is that in this version of him there is no suggestion that mars is a dead planet or that the character is the last of his kind many of the tales of the time feature either martian technology or the appearance of other martian characters such as his elder brother t omm j onzz 6 detective comics 236 october 1956 for example features the character making contact with the planet mars and his parents j onzz eventually reveals his existence to the world after which he operates openly as a superhero and becomes a charter member of the justice league during the character s initial few years as a member of the justice league he is often used as a substitute for superman in stories just as green arrow was for batman as dc comics were worried about using their flagship characters too often in justice league stories fearing overexposure 7 the martian and the archer inaugurated the team up format of the brave and the bold 8 j onzz appears there one other time working with the flash 9 in some stories he is shown travelling through space at near light speed 10 or to other planets 11 the detective john jones is ostensibly killed in action by the idol head of diabolu an artifact which generates supernatural monsters j onzz abandons the civilian identity as he decides fighting this new menace will take a

persona of marco xavier in order to infiltrate the international crime cartel known as vulture which he defeats in the final installment of his original series 14 as superman was allowed by dc to become a fully active member of the justice league j onzz s appearances there dwindled he last participated in a mission in his original tenure in 61 march 1968 shortly before his solo series was discontinued the house of mystery 173 may june 1968 in 71 his people finally came to earth for him and he left with them to found and become leader of new mars 15 over the next 15 years j onzz

post crisis mid 1980s mid 1990s edit j onn j onzz trying and failing to relax in his true form and reflecting on his history with the league in early 1987 dc revamped its struggling justice league of america series by re launching the title as justice league this new series written by keith giffen and j m dematteis with art by kevin maguire and later adam hughes added quirky humor to the team s stories j onzz is present from the first issue and within the stories is used as a straight man for other characters in comical situations the series also added a number of elements to his back story that have remained to the present such as j onzz s obsession with chocos cookies due to shazam s influence the 1988 four issue miniseries martian manhunter by j m dematteis and mark badger further redefined the character and changed a number of important aspects of both his character and his origin story it is revealed that dr erdel did not die and that the character s humanoid appearance was due to physiological trauma and attempts to block out the death of his race his familiar appearance a compromise between his true form and a human appearance based upon erdel s mental concept of what a martian should look like later series use retroactive continuity retcon to establish that his real form is private and that even on mars his public appearance was the familiar version the native name for mars is said to be ma aleca andra in his native language a nod to malacandra the name used by the inhabitants of mars in c s lewis novel out of the silent planet citation needed the series also adds to canon the idea that j onzz was not only displaced in space but in time and the martian race including j onzz s wife and daughter has been dead for thousands of years 25 the 1990s saw the character continue to serve in many different versions of the justice league of america in addition to serving in the league under his own identity he also joins under duress disguised as bloodwynd a

martian manhunter is the most recognized hero in the southern hemisphere and that he maintains a number of different secret identities many of them outside the united states however following two incidents later in the series in which john jones separates from martian manhunter volume issue needed he decides to focus on his original human identity and retire the others the series establishes that j onzz has a disturbed brother ma alefa ak who uses his shape shifting abilities to pose as j onzz capturing and torturing jemm son of saturn and terraforming part of earth to resemble mars areoforming this is all part of a grand plan designed to convince the rest of the justice league that j onzz has turned into a sociopath however j onzz is able to clear his name and defeat ma alefa ak despite having most of his body destroyed in an exploding spaceship he is able to regenerate his body from his severed hand after transplanting his soul into his hand and sending it back to his home

detective who is murdered by corrupt colleagues and that j onzz subsequently assumed his identity to complete an important court case in issues of jla written by joe kelly j onzz attempts to conquer his fear of fire and makes a deal with a flame wielding villainess named scorch who wants j onzz s telepathic help in dealing with her own mental issues the two falling in love in the process 28 this effort results in j onzz briefly transforming into the burning martian fernus an ancient version of the martian race that were modified by the guardians of the universe the guardians had recognized the danger that the burning martians posed to civilized life as they reproduced through the psychic energy generated by suffering and grief but had simply engineered the martians into their new state rather than destroy them as part of this engineering the martians had been programmed with a new vulnerability to fire with j onzz breaking the genetic blocks against fire also giving him access to race memories of the burning martians 29 despite fernus power the league were able to help j onzz reassert himself over fernus manitou raven helping key league members access j onzz s mind and draw out his true self while plastic man battled fernus directly 30 allowing the true j onzz to manifest when fernus attempted to spawn using the psychic grief caused by the destruction of the city of chongjin the sorrow enough for at least one spawning even if the flash had saved the city s residents with fernus physical form defeated j onzz s traditional aversion to fire was redefined as he is now invulnerable to flames unless they are flames of passion or of some other psychic significance 31 this change is forgotten about in later series and adventures citation needed crisis era mid 2000s

the forces of barbatos the heroes won but at the cost of the destruction of the source wall following the conclusion of no justice he rejoins the justice league as its new chairman powers and abilities edit j onzz possesses a wide variety of abilities native to the green martian race such as super strength durability flight regeneration shapeshifting intangibility invisibility telepathy telekinesis extrasensory input and heat vision physical edit the martian manhunter has shapeshifting abilities he often takes the human disguise of detective john jones he has often been shown to grow an extra pair of arms to supplement his fighting abilities and his strength such as when he helped move 1 3 of the earth with both superman and wonder woman knocked out shazam once stopping a ship many times larger than the planet from colliding with earth in tandem with superman and destroying the moon whose gravity was increased a billion fold to the point it was tearing off the earth s crust and ejecting every continent to the atmosphere he can become stiff or malleable as well as alter the size and length of limbs he has elongated parts of himself into bladed weapons during combat his density is also variable and changes as he wills it he can use this ability to become intangible and move through objects or allow attacks to fly harmlessly through him or to become extremely dense and increase his invulnerability j onzz can also become invisible in addition to these powers he can fly and possesses super strength psionic mental psychic and extrasensory edit j onn j onzz is the most powerful telepath on earth being able to control and affect even the spectre and doctor fate with his telepathy aquaman has stated that martian manhunter s telepathy exceeds even the telepathy of other members of the martian race he said that with j onzz s great telepathic power his own telepathy just pings off of him while when aquaman was in the presence of j onzz s brother ma alefa ak there was no such effect j onzz is capable of linking the minds of all superheroes at once from a distance of the moon to all corners of earth even once scanning the entire galaxy to see if anyone was not experiencing a brief moment of transcendent bliss he is also capable of reading the minds of all inhabitants of earth at once his telepathic abilities also allow him to create realistic illusions telepathically trace and locate people shut down people s minds brain blast mental shield influence thoughts mind control people manipulate memory astral projection possession induce sleep reprogram or reorder minds and transfer information directly into people s brains the martian manhunter s mind control capabilities have allowed him to mind control the joker and make him temporarily sane as well as mind controlling several white martians at once he is also capable of mentally shielding those around him from telepathic assault his own mental defenses are so strong that he is able to telepathically shield himself from the combined might of several white martians and from the mageddon machinery he has at times also demonstrated limited telekinetic abilities though such showings are rare and often forgotten enhanced martian senses edit j onzz possesses martian vision allowing his eyes to see across the electromagnetic spectrum including x ray vision he can also project energy beams known as martian beams the exact effects of which have varied in different decades from incendiary effects to concussive impacts to disintegration j onzz also has nine senses compared to humans giving him clearer and more numerous perceptions 60 natural skills and talents edit aside from his superpowered abilities as a martian j onzz is also a very capable detective and sleuth due to his training as a manhunter in mars he is also an expert tracker and hand to hand combatant far above the average martian as he has been shown able to defeat many white martians at once 61 as batman mentions in his file in many ways martian manhunter is like an amalgam of superman and the dark knight himself 62 clarification needed weakness and limitations edit one of j onzz s signature traits is his vulnerability to fire although it has been an element of the character since his earliest appearances it has been depicted differently by writers throughout the character s long career in his earliest appearances he was shown as having a weakness to fire while in his native martian form 63 over time this was developed into pyrophobia with fire being the martian s achilles heel equivalent to superman s weakness to kryptonite exposure to fire typically causes j onzz to lose his ability to maintain his physical form so that he melts into a pool of writhing green plasma one portrayal explained that the flame weakness was tied into martian telepathy with fire causing so much chaos in martian minds that they collapse volume issue needed it was revealed during the trial by fire storyline 64 that the martian weakness to fire is a built in psychosomatic effect placed in the martian race long ago by the guardians of the universe to prevent them from reverting to a previous evolutionary state in which they were highly aggressive on the verge of interstellar conquest and in need of flames and the psychic suffering of others in order to reproduce at the end of the arc this weakness to mundane fire was removed with j onzz explaining that now only fires of psychic significance could harm him such as flames of a magical or pyrokinetic nature or even flames created by an arsonist during the fernus storyline batman noted that martian shapeshifting was an instantaneous reflex based around the psychic study of others allowing j onzz to adapt rapidly to any opponent s physiology or fighting style curiously this aspect of his power puts him at a slight disadvantage when faced with plastic man who is immune to telepathy and who has no set fighting style but is instead described as inspiration given form a completely spontaneous and unpredictable being 65 in the new 52 the weakness to fire is pyrophobia that is unique to him as a crippling anxiety due to the trauma of witnessing the fiery death of his race an explanation previously established in the 1988 martian manhunter miniseries 25 j onzz himself notes that it is ridiculous that he is one of the most powerful beings alive and has such a simple weakness adversaries edit the following are enemies of the martian manhunter imperium the alien species responsible for wiping out almost all of the martian

humiliating defeats leading to a strong mutual enmity between the two characters d kay d razz a female green martian d kay was imprisoned on mars by her fellow green martians because she conducted experiments on members of her kind whose minds were not open to the communal martian telepathic mind after the death of the green martians she no longer had even the company of those who imprisoned her d kay goes insane as a result of the complete isolation until she was beamed to earth by dr erdel once on earth the assault of thoughts thrusts her into greater extent depths of insanity and she attacks dr erdel and his daughter leaving her permanently scarred as d kay escaped in desperation d kay stole the identity of a human and completely erased all memory of her previous identity j onzz s death in final crisis put cracks in these telepathic memory blocks but she did not regain her memories until j onzz was resurrected in blackest night 38 d kay is desperate to recreate the martian race with j onzz to the point where she even attempted to kill miss martian because she perceived a threat to her claim to j onzz 42 d kay s body is distorted and includes an extra mouth at her torso which

hands of the police the headmaster real name thaddeus romero hoskins an arrogant elitist born to a rich family hoskins graduated m i t at the age of fifteen however hoskins social skills never developed properly and he felt alienated by all around him he feared mankind will die out if they stayed on earth becoming extinct like the dinosaurs hoskins was inspired to develop a robotic model for military application that consisted of an inhuman head attached to spidery legs dubbed a headman it could decapitate enemy soldiers in the field and reanimate their bodies to act as cannon fodder for its controllers those in scientific circles including john henry irons were unaware of the robot moving beyond the theoretical stage later hoskins body was discovered his head detached by a laser and his brain missing entirely in a powerful new bipedal shell hoskins renamed himself the headmaster and set his master plan into motion he re purposed a former norad installation dubbed the ark and designed as a nuclear bomb shelter from here the headmaster set to work on a massive spaceship that could carry the finest examples of humanity off their home planet in need of a work force to carry out the task the headmaster created an army of headmen he then sent them out to kill and commandeer the bodies of homeless people to construct his craft the murders of two police officers who stumbled upon one of headmaster s victims under the control of a headman attracted the attention of private investigator john jones secretly the martian manhunter using his shapeshifting abilities to assume the visage of a derelict j onzz staked out an alley until he was attacked by a headman after being wounded in a struggle with the device the martian manhunter took its remains to the jla watchtower for further study with the aid of steel and oracle the manhunter located the ark and its contents the headmaster met with j onzz hoping to convince him of the merits of his plan so that he would not lose precious time by abandoning the base dedicated to the preservation of all life equally treasured the martian manhunter declared himself the headmaster s implacable foe a scuffle ensued which ended with the martian manhunter burying the headmaster under his own spaceship the damage headmaster took deactivated his headman and pieces of his robotic armor were uncovered after an explosion leveled the ark it is unclear whether hoskins brain was still within the headmaster body or if he is perhaps still at large 68 the headmen a robotic military group led by the headmaster the headmen were spider like robots created by hoskins to do his bidding with heads resembling the headmaster s standing at roughly two feet tall with long arachnid legs tipped with blades the headmen were controlled by human brains wiped clean and reprogrammed the headmen were often assigned the task of decapitating derelicts dipping their spiked limbs into their victim s chest cavity and replacing their headspace with its own the headmen could then animated the deceased bodies to perform most motor functions to facilitate this act the headmen were armed spectacularly a laser beam emitted from their right ocular cavity could kill most people on contact and were capable of momentarily blinding one of the most powerful superbeings on earth their electronic eyes were further enhanced with thermal and radar imaging the headman robots were physically resistant to incredible amounts of damage and were both quick and agile the prophet the ancient holy man k rkzar traveled the known universe to sit with instructors of every religion in his pursuit of the one spiritual truth long ago he paid a visit to mars learning of their gods such as h ronmeer eventually k rkzar went into a centuries long seclusion to process all he had absorbed from his quest when his intended emergence to discuss his findings was announced this causes the leaders of many organized religions in the universe to scream for his head as luck would have it j onzz decided on that very moment in time to seek out k rkzar in hopes he might have information about other survivors from mars he instead found himself one of k rkzar s few defenders in the midst of a holy war it was widely believed that k rkzar s trusted disciple fellow priest bruaka was the only being aware of k rkzar s whereabouts the martian manhunter joined a small group of agents in taking bruaka into protective custody with legions of bloodthirsty zealots in pursuit the reptilian church head paral was a central figure in organizing an unprecedented alliance of faiths all for the sole purpose of destroying k rkzar before he can spread his blasphemy across the universe as the manhunter and his group consistently evaded these forces paral chose to unleash the power and the wrath of the prophet the prophet spoke almost entirely in the scripture of his deity grud as he matched the martian manhunter blow for blow in battle upon asteroids in the vacuum of deep space the prophet was distracted when the ship he had been pursuing exploded in a kamikaze style collision with the vessel of the fundamentalist s aides this gave j onzz both the hostility and the opportunity needed to overtake the prophet busting his scepter and throttling him unconscious k rkzar delivered his simple message of peace and the prophet has yet to reemerge 69 the human flame a villain who wore a special suit that allowed him to project fire which is the weakness of the martian manhunter he was the first actual supervillain the martian manhunter faced kanto darkseid s master assassin he fought j onzz during the attack on mars the two have been bitter rivals ever since ma alefa ak also called malefic the twin brother and archenemy of the martian manhunter he was created by john ostrander and tom mandrake the character first appeared in martian manhunter vol 2 0 october 1998 the brother of j onzz ma alefa ak was the only member of the martian race born without telepathy and a weakness to fire feeling ostracized because of his genetic differences ma alefa ak was the architect of an extinction level event this event was known as h ronmeer s curse h ronmeer s curse was a plague of fire this curse attacked martians via their telepathic abilities whenever a martian attempted to use their telepathic gifts or commune with the great mind they would fall victim to the curse and ultimately burn to death with the exception of ma alefa ak s brother j onzz and himself nearly all green martians on the planet died as a result of ma alefa ak s handiwork for centuries ma alefa ak continued to live in the ruins of mars unaware that his brother had survived the plague and had been transported through space and time to the planet earth several years ago ma alefa ak learned of j onzz s existence and followed him back to earth in an effort to complete the genocide of the martian race by destroying its last surviving son ma alefa ak has tried many times to finish his work and kill his brother j onzz but has not succeeded ma alefa ak has all the same powers as other martians except for telepathy ma alefa ak also does not have the weakness to fire like other martians do he worships darkseid as his god in turn undermining the independence of martian history and helped to inspire the anti life equation that has cost countless lives the marshal genetically altered to be the perfect martian warrior the marshal towered over his soldiers he tried to invade earth the master gardener the master gardener and his shapeshifting assistant the lizard man came to earth during world war ii and took advantage of the terror and confusion of the time to infiltrate governments and communications cartels they grew plants bearing fungus that bonded to the human nervous system allowing them to control the very words they spoke under threat of spontaneous combustion mister v a k a faceless leader of vulture mongul an alien warlord who tried to force j onzz to give him the key to a super weapon professor arnold hugo an evil genius originally a batman enemy in his second appearance he fought j onzz and went on to become his first recurring foe robo chargers gigantic monstrosities which seemingly combined elements of both androids and tanks the robo chargers were designed for war and employed by the thythen fueled by the life force of living beings the robo chargers were used to police the planet vonn their unconscious batteries were hung from girders and had their essence drained through helmets connected with networks of cable to the robo chargers the robo chargers stood several stories tall and moved through rocky terrain with great speed on tank treads the constructs were covered in turrets called projectors which fired blasts that could disintegrate a target the design of their upper bodies were humanoid complete with head chest arms and five fingered hands including opposable thumbs the robo chargers had large antennae likely used to receive commands from the thythen who also bore antennae whether communication with the thythen was telepathic was not made clear but this seems most likely to have been the case with the martians 70 thythen the thythen were warmongers engaged in a cosmic struggle with their neighbors according to writing found on a tablet and translated by j onzz within the alien arsenal the thythen invaded the planet vonn and preyed upon the native people there in order to escape the thythen this people abandoned their world and broadcast themselves to a distant solar system three members of the thythen an unholy trinity remained on vonn to charge their robo chargers with the remaining inhabitants life force these victims included a group of green martians who had survived mars devastation and found their way to vonn the thythen camp was located in the west where their domed headquarters and the girders that held the robo chargers batteries could be seen from afar the thythen seemed to have no compunctions about exploiting the life energies of their prisoners while treating them inhumanely they also encouraged the traitorous bel juz to lure others into a trap to expand their herd of the three thythen on vonn two were disintegrated by their own robo chargers after they were taken over by the minds of the martians the third traveled from vonn in the alien arsenal before being defeated by superman how this thythen was managed afterward is unknown 70 tor the ghost of a robot criminal from mars martian scientists among them j onzz constructed a nigh indestructible robot of vast strength and intellect to serve their planet forever j onzz was apprehensive about the result and rightly so when a fellow scientist accidentally fed a master criminal thought control card into the tor control board tor s mechanical brain quickly absorbed its crime facts via a remote electronic connection and the robot began to function as a violent criminal tor proceeded to ravage mars its appetite for material possessions and the general rule implacable unable to reason with tor or damage it with martian weapons j onzz devised a plan to use the robot s greed against it tor was lured onto a rocket ship with the false rumor of riches within and blasted off to the dead planet of turas there it discovered that the solar dust on the planet would slowly destroy even its impressive being through unknown means tor eventually learned of j onzz s own exile to earth tor spent months developing machines that would allow it to mentally control an earthling as well as somehow make the host immune to harm tor succeeded in taking control of the gangster marty kirk just 24 hours before tor s fated destruction and set upon a campaign of revenge despite tor s best efforts in kirk s body j onzz managed to elude the robot until its remaining 24 hours were nearly up tor made a last ditch effort to ruin j onzz by revealing his presence to his adopted world but j onzz set a fire that led to tor s exorcism from kirk 71 vulture an international crime syndicate whom j onzz infiltrated for some time before finally destroying them the white
