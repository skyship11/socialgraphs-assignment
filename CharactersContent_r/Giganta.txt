peter and went on to become one of wonder woman s most recognizable and persistent foes appearing during every major era of the hero s comic book adventures and adapted frequently for television and animation the modern incarnation of giganta possesses the superhuman ability to increase her physical size and mass effectively transforming into a giantess 2 this power set was not a feature of her

super friends the size changing ability would later be incorporated into the comic book giganta s modern age characterization for her post crisis appearances giganta has been adapted into several

moulton marston giganta is presented as a preternaturally strong gorilla who through advanced technology is mutated into a hulking red haired human woman in an ensuing struggle with wonder woman and her allies giganta foments a savage revolution leading a group of prehistoric cavemen in an attempt to conquer civilized society marston was a psychologist who conceived many of wonder woman s early foes as allegories for psychological and moral motifs his characterization of giganta blends a common early 20th century misconception about charles darwin s theory of evolution the fallacy that early human beings descended from modern apes with another western commonplace the colonialist conflation of pre civilization with amorality as such giganta s nature as a supposedly primitive human being was understood as granting her both animalistic and potentially malicious characteristics after several clashes with wonder woman giganta became a member of villainy inc a team of supervillains

continuity in 1985 in a publication event known as the crisis on infinite earths wonder woman her supporting characters and many of her foes were re imagined and reintroduced though giganta was initially absent from this revised set of storylines she eventually returned to the continuity in 1998 in a story by wonder woman writer artist john byrne as a research scientist named dr doris zuel 3 no longer a gorilla mutated into a human form this post crisis version of the character was now a human being who transferred her consciousness into the body of a gorilla named giganta through a series of convoluted circumstances prescribed by several writers across several years zuel would subsequently transfer her consciousness again this time into the body of a red haired metahuman woman now possessing the ability to increase her size and mass zuel began using the gorilla s name giganta as her supervillainous nom de guerre she embarked on a campaign to bring down wonder woman a project which would lead her to join the modern incarnation of villainy inc the characterization of the post crisis giganta de emphasized savagery in favor of a more sympathetic interpretation storylines in the all new atom and secret six focus with some humor on zuel s attempt to juggle a legitimate career in academia with a side hustle as a villain for hire as well as more seriously on the history of the chronic degenerative illness that led her to seek to transfer her consciousness fictional character biography edit earth two edit giganta in wonder woman 28 giganta was introduced

criminal team villainy inc eviless steals wonder woman s lasso and kidnaps hippolyta giganta joins with the atlantean queen clea to cause trouble 6 earth one edit in 1966 giganta s origin is revamped to include doctor psycho 7 in this story doctor psycho hypnotized a zoo gorilla named giganta to fall in love with steve trevor after wonder woman defeats giganta professor zool appeared asking to have the gorilla turned over to her for experimentation taking advantage of this doctor psycho took giganta out of the zoo and brought her to professor zool so that he can use an evolution ray on her this turned giganta into a huge blonde woman who still loves steve trevor wonder woman defeated giganta and took her to paradise island for rehabilitation 8 doris zuel edit the contemporary version of the character is the alter ego of dr doris zuel 9 who suffers from a fatal blood disease she captures wonder woman and plans to put her life essence into wonder woman s body using an experimental machine interrupted by wonder girl halfway through the experiment she ends up with her consciousness in a test animal gorilla named giganta 2 desperate to return her mind to a human body zuel the

12 as part of the society she takes part in the battle of metropolis a confrontation with multiple heroes including elasti girl the size changing member of the doom patrol the society ultimately loses this battle 13 when diana prince noted that giganta s intellect reduces as she grows in size 14 compelling the villain to become less rational and more prone to violence she was corrected by her colleagues in the department of metahuman affairs they implied that giganta has overcome that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size 15 giganta in her one year later costume which she continued to use until the new 52 one year later giganta along with the cheetah and doctor psycho engage in a battle with donna troy who has assumed the identity of wonder woman one year after the

difficulties mellower than in her appearances in the all new atom series she seems to accept and respect the shortcomings brought by their different lifestyles going so far as to help wonder woman in

secret six 24 the team also includes the shrinking killer dwarfstar who recently hired deathstroke and his titans to kill ryan choi giganta initially seems unaware of this fact admitting to dwarfstar
