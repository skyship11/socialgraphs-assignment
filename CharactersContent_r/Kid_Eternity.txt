to die that day dc comics edit 1980s edit in the early 1980s another american publisher dc comics decided to revive kid eternity unlike most of the quality stable who were depicted as living on the parallel world earth x kid eternity was retconned into the marvel family of earth s which dc had acquired from another former competitor fawcett comics this change was made because the kid s power bore such a similarity to the marvels after a magic word was spoken and a character who had not been present arrived in a bolt of lightning although unlike the marvels the kid himself did not disappear in this revival the kid was given a new name christopher kit freeman and became the brother of captain marvel jr freddy freeman he is shown to live in the same neighbourhood as shazam and the elders eternity in his first new story he assists captain marvel in battling villains from american history whom doctor sivana has resurrected to cause trouble in philadelphia while he prepares his plan to destroy the city billy batson goes to the pavilion but he is seized by a thug before he can speak he is bound and gagged and taken inside the kid goes there and sees billy but is coshed by the thug he too is bound and gagged and brought inside he and billy are tied back to back and placed under the liberty bell billy removes his gag using benedict arnold s sword as it goes through the crack they defeat sivana after which the kid returns to eternity kid eternity became a supporting character in shazam stories and there was even an eventual rematch with both her highness and silk and later master man kid eternity s powers prove a valuable asset at least once when a villain cast a magical black void around the marvel family in their regular forms thus preventing them from calling down the magic lightning to change although the villains also bound and gagged kid eternity he managed to remove the gag to summon zeus who supplied the magic lightning necessary for the marvel family to change earth s was merged with earths one two 4 and x in crisis on infinite earths and kid eternity vanished along with the original version of the marvel family modern incarnation edit comics
