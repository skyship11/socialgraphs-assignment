colossal monster made up of the bodies of hundreds of june moones and defeats superman wonder woman and cyborg with ease john constantine deduces that madame xanadu said an incantation that separated june moone from the enchantress and reads an incantation that reverses the spell reuniting the enchantress and june moone again 43 dc rebirth edit the enchantress serves as a member of the suicide squad again and during the black vault story arc they retrieve an alien item that serves as a portal to the phantom zone however once they bring it back to belle reve penitentiary it causes all the inmates to go into a killing frenzy except harley quinn amanda waller killer croc and rick flag june moone lets the enchantress out who also remains unaffected due to being a magical entity she manages to get harley quinn to the vault but is incapacitated by zod when he sucks the air out of her lungs in one of the later issues june moone was called upon by amanda waller to help a military general whose house had been possessed by a demon she turns into the enchantress but she ends up scheming with the demon to escape amanda waller and destroy the world she turns back to june to have

doctor polaris the emerald empress and johnny sorrow the original suicide squad she threatens maxwell lord only to be quickly overwhelmed by his telepathic powers characterization edit love interests edit despite having been characterized as having some disdain for men 44 june has formulated romances with characters throughout her history in comics june s first love interest in publication was alan dell whom was attracted to the enchantress persona not knowing that the enchantress was also june herself sebastian faust was also featured as one of her love interests faust and june enchantress first met during day of judgement where the two s brief friendship is interrupted when faust sacrifices enchantress in order to reignite the flames of hell in a bid to eventually stop asmodeus from completely gaining the power of the spectre attracted to june sebastian is guilt ridden by his actions and stays his distance as she returns to alan 44 sometime later he returns to help june as the separation of the enchantress and june slowly kills her and voiced continual hope that the two would be in a romantic relationship should he find a way to restore her enchantress personality in order to save her from death eventually faust succeeds in doing so while seemingly sacrificing himself in a battle with a powerful sorcerer 23 ragman was revealed to also have been attracted to enchantress although when he kissed her she vehemently rejected his advances 44 in recent continuities killer croc also has dated enchantress the two of them subtly pushed together by amanda waller as a mean of controlling the both of them later while the two established a genuine connection 45 this would come to fruition when killer croc s life is leverage against june in her membership of suicide squad black a mythical counterpart to suicide squad as waller pits her against a re invented version of sebastian faust whom she doesn t share a romance with in the new continuity and his eco terrorist cohorts alongside the rest of the team facing similarly manipulations 46 in media june s most prominent love interest is rick flag in the dc extended universe the former chosen by amanda waller deliberately so the two of them would form a close bond and become lovers allowing her to have leverage over the two their relationship would come to an end in the sequel of suicide squad due to the death of rick flag powers and abilities edit the enchantress is a powerful sorceress considered being among the most dangerous of mystical villains to the superhuman community and one of the most dangerous magic practitioners on earth in the dc universe alongside peers such as the wizard and sebastian faust 47 she possesses an array of magical powers including flight the ability to phase through solid walls the transformation of objects and the power to transform her own appearance she also could transform into her magical state by calling enchantress 48 49 a unique aspect of her power is her sensitivity to magic she was able to link to the essence of eclipso in the day of vengeance story line using the connection to speak eclipso s thoughts to the rest of the group and has also mystically tracked the spectre by divining his magical trail she has also been seen to remotely access another magic user s power as she did when she channeled the power of almost all magical beings on earth through her to captain marvel to aid him in his battle with the spectre and again with strega of the pentacle though all of the magicians she came into contact with allowed her to tap into them 50 later portrayals of the character in the new 52 also grants her enough power to warp reality at will and is powerful enough to defeat superman in battle 51 while preferring to use magic june is considered both an average athlete and hand to hand combatant 48 she is also a skilled artist 49 and recent incarnations of june is able to call upon magical powers without invoking the enchantress entity as a sorceress enchantress has access to several arcane items she has possession of the nightwitch s herne ramsgate cauldron which allows her to find almost every magical creature
