fox s own time period each flash had individually fought mota over the course of several years in the 20th century fox s mission was a failure but during his return trip the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superspeed he defeated mota as a new iteration of the flash and operated as his century s flash for a time shortly after he moved to the 853rd century and joined justice legion a also known as justice legion alpha as seen in the dc one million series of books the name john fox is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers john broome who co

1982 he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes barry allen was wearing when he gained his powers to give himself super speed kryiad later sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature bizarro flash bizarro flash was created when bizarro cloned flash he had a costume the reverse colors of flash s however he had a mallet symbol because flash was holding one when he was cloned the modern version of bizarro flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt shaped mustard stain he has the powers of the flash but he is completely intangible powers and abilities all incarnations of the flash can move think and react at light speeds as well as having superhuman endurance that allows them to run incredible distances some notably later versions can vibrate so fast that they can pass through walls in a process called quantum tunneling 17 travel through time and can also lend and borrow speed speedsters can also heal more rapidly than an average human in addition most incarnations have an invisible aura around their respective bodies that protects them from air friction and the kinetic effects of their powers on several occasions the flash has raced against superman either to determine who is faster or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat these races however often result in ties because of outside circumstances writer jim shooter and artist curt swan crafted the story superman s race with the flash in superman 199 august 1967 which featured the first race between the flash and superman 18 writer e nelson bridwell and artist ross andru produced the race to the end of the universe a follow up story four months later in the flash 175 december 1967 19 however after the dc universe revision after crisis on infinite earths the flash does successfully beat superman in a race in the adventures of superman 463 with the explanation that superman is not accustomed to running at high speed for extended periods of time since flying is more versatile and less strenuous which means the far more practiced flash has the advantage after final crisis in flash rebirth 3 the flash is shown as being significantly faster than superman able to outrun him as superman struggles to keep up with him he reveals that all the close races between them before had been for charity in the smallville episode run the flash can not only run faster than a pre superman clark kent but also match clark s top speed while running backward while various incarnations of the flash have proven their ability to run at light speed the ability to steal speed from other objects allows respective flashes to even significantly surpass this velocity in flash the human race 20 wally is shown absorbing kinetic energy to an extent enabling him to move faster than teleportation and run from the end of the universe back to earth in less than a planck instant speedsters may at times use the ability to speed read at incredible rates and in doing so process vast amounts of information whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary their ability to think fast also allows them some immunity to telepathy as their thoughts operate at a rate too rapid for telepaths such as martian manhunter or gorilla grodd to read or influence their minds flashes and other super speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate this is often done to have private conversations in front of non fast people as when flash speaks to superman about his ability to serve both the titans and the jla in the titans 2 speed talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise he also has the ability to change the vibration of his vocal cords making it so he can change how his voice sounds to others while not having the physical strength of many of his comrades and enemies flash has shown to be able to use his speed to exert incredible momentum into physical attacks in injustice gods among us flash uses these kinds of attacks as many of his special moves the flash has also claimed that he can process thoughts in less than an attosecond at times he is able to throw lightning created by his super speed and make speed vortices some flashes also have the ability to create speed avatars i e duplicates and these avatars have sometimes been sent to different timelines to complete a particular mission barry allen exhibits this ability in the live action series the flash he can also be seen negating the effects of the anti life equation when he freed iris west from its control probably due to his connection with the speed force it is said that wally west has reached the velocity of 23 759 449 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 about 24 tredecillion c the speed of light and he could only do this with the help of every human being on earth moving so the speed force was joined through everyone 21 with that speed he was able to run not only from planet to planet but also to different galaxies and universes at what would be considered a blink of an eye different
