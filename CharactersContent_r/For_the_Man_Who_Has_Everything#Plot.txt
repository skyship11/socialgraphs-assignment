artist dave gibbons and the two enjoyed working together gibbons talent caught the attention of dc comics in 1982 that year len wein hired him as the artist of the green lantern series the following year moore was also hired by wein who had been seeking a writer for swamp thing due to the low sales the title had seen alan moore reinvented the character and introduced new themes dealing with social and environmental issues 2 moore took over the series in 1984 and his scripts soon attracted the attention of audiences and critics both before and while working on swamp thing moore submitted numerous proposals to the publisher seeking to work with characters like the martian manhunter and the challengers of the unknown but all ended up being rejected because dc had already developed projects with other writers for the characters with which he intended to work when the editor dick giordano finally approved the project that would become watchmen moore and gibbons began working on

superman while it consumes his bio aura feeding him a realistic dream based on his heart s deepest desire in his catatonic state superman dreams of a normal life on his long destroyed home planet of krypton happily married to lyla lerrol with children while wonder woman battles the more powerful mongul at her own risk batman and robin try to free superman by prying the black mercy off of him superman s fantasy takes a dark turn as his father jor el whose prediction of krypton s doom was unfulfilled has become discredited and embittered superman s mother lara has died from the eating sickness further isolating jor el from his family even the death of his brother zor el has not reconciled jor el to his sister in law alura and niece kara zor el kryptonian society has undergone political upheaval and the disgraced jor el has become chairman of an extremist movement the sword of rao calling for a return to krypton s noble and unspoiled past through the establishment of a totalitarian theocracy under the leadership of brother lor em the phantom zone krypton s other dimensional prison system developed by jor el has become unpopular with the public kara zor el is assaulted by anti zone protesters for whom the criminal jax ur sentenced to eternity in the zone is a martyr kal el decides to take his family away from the city for protection only to witness jor el presiding over a political demonstration reminiscent of a fascist rally which dissolves into a riot between anti zone protesters and the sword of rao superman gradually wakes from his increasingly disturbing dream but not before tearfully saying goodbye to his son van el away at the kandor crater batman pries the mercy from superman s chest and the plant latches on to him instead submerging batman in his own dream in which his parents murder is prevented when thomas wayne disarms joe chill superman awakens enraged by the mercy s action and attacks mongul before he can kill wonder woman they battle across the fortress causing massive damage robin uses mongul s discarded gauntlets to pry the mercy off batman stuffing the plant inside a gauntlet to carry it safely toward the battle subduing mongul superman is distracted by the sight of the statues of his parents and mongul gains the upper hand but robin drops the mercy on him seized by the plant mongul is submerged in his own fantasy in which he swats the mercy aside kills the heroes and goes on to conquer earth and the universe tending to their wounds batman mentions to wonder woman that his fantasy included him marrying kathy kane and having a teenage daughter while wonder woman confesses envy that she did not find out her heart s desire planning to imprison mongul in a black hole across the galaxy superman unwraps his gifts wonder woman brought a replica of kandor made by the gem smiths of paradise island prompting superman to hide his own replica of the bottle city at super speed batman s gift turns out to be

justice league unlimited in this version robin does not appear and most of his lines and actions are given to wonder woman while some details such as the protective gauntlets are removed and many other details are altered batman simply brings money as his present while wonder woman brings the new krypton rose while mongul surmises in the comic that superman s fantasy may involve the aboriginal backwater he grew up in i e smallville in the episode he speculates that the mercy s world involves superman controlling the universe lyla lerrol kal el s wife in superman s fantasy is renamed loana and is an amalgam of both lois lane and lana lang the two main loves of clark kent s life loana is voiced by dana delany who provided the voice of lois lane in the earlier series superman the animated

adaptation only the son van el makes an appearance also the dark scenes from superman s fantasy are replaced with seismic activity that only he actively notices and it ends with krypton s destruction as he realizes the false nature of the fantasy while the black mercy is gradually removed meanwhile batman s fantasy consists only of his father disarming and beating joe chill during his mugging similar to superman s experience it becomes progressively more dark with joe slowly winning against his father as wonder woman gradually frees batman from the black mercy and he realizes the false nature of the fantasy in the end batman does not share his fantasy and wonder woman expresses no interest to know her heart s desire and mongul s fantasy of conquest is not shown and instead represented with a soundtrack of screams and explosions as the camera zooms in on his slightly smiling face j m dematteis adapted the script from the alan moore dave gibbons story according to dwayne
