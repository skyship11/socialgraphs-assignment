and bill finger introduced robin the boy wonder in detective comics 38 1940 the name robin the boy wonder and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by robin hood jerry robinson noted he came up with robin because the adventures of robin hood were boyhood favorites of mine i had been given a robin hood book illustrated by n c wyeth and that s what i quickly sketched out when i suggested the name robin hood which they seemed to like and then showed them the costume and if you look at it it s wyeth s costume from my memory because i didn t have the book to look at 3 83 other

citation needed sometimes both sources are credited as in len wein s the untold legend of the batman although robin is best known as batman s sidekick the robins have also been members of the superhero groups the teen titans with the original robin dick grayson as a founding member and the latter group s leader and young justice in batman stories the character of robin was intended to be batman s watson bill finger writer for many early batman adventures wrote citation needed robin was an outgrowth of a conversation i had with bob as i said batman was a combination of douglas fairbanks and sherlock holmes holmes had his watson the thing that bothered me was that batman didn t have anyone to talk to and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking i found that as i went along batman needed a watson to talk to that s how robin came to be bob called me over and said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with batman i thought it was a great idea fictional character biography the following fictional characters have assumed the robin role at various times in the main dc comics universe continuity dick grayson main article dick grayson dick grayson as robin on the cover of detective comics 48 february 1941 art by bob kane in the comics dick grayson was an 8 year old acrobat and the youngest of a family act called the flying graysons a gangster named boss zucco loosely based on actor edward g robinson s little caesar character had been extorting money from the circus and killed grayson s parents john and mary by sabotaging their trapeze equipment as a warning against defiance batman investigated the crime and as his alter ego billionaire bruce wayne had dick put under his custody as a legal ward together they investigated zucco and collected the evidence needed to bring him to justice from his debut appearance in 1940 through 1969 robin was known as the boy wonder batman creates a costume for dick consisting of a red tunic yellow cape green gloves green boots green spandex briefs and a utility belt as he grew older graduated from high school and enrolled in hudson university robin continued his career as the teen wonder from 1970 into the early 1980s the character was rediscovered by a new generation of fans during the 1980s because of the success of the new teen titans in which he left batman s shadow entirely to assume the identity of nightwing he aids batman throughout the later storyline regarding the several conflicts with jason todd until he makes his final return as the red hood grayson

minimize the change they made the new robin jason peter todd who first appeared in batman 357 1983 similar to a young grayson like dick grayson jason todd was the son of circus acrobats murdered by a criminal this time the batman adversary killer croc and then adopted by bruce wayne in this incarnation he was originally red haired and unfailingly cheerful and wore his circus costume to fight crime until dick grayson presented him with a robin suit of his own at that point he dyed his hair black after the miniseries crisis on infinite earths much of the dc comics continuity was redone dick grayson s origin years with batman and growth into nightwing remained mostly unchanged but todd s character was completely revised he was now a black haired street orphan who first encountered batman when he attempted to steal tires from the batmobile batman saw to it that he was placed in a school for troubled youths weeks later after dick grayson became nightwing and todd proved his crime fighting worth by helping batman catch a gang of robbers batman offered todd the position as robin believing that readers never truly bonded with todd dc comics made the controversial decision in 1988 to poll readers using a 1 900 number as to whether or not todd should be killed the event received more attention in the mainstream media than any other comic book event before it readers voted yes by a small margin 5 343 to 5 271 and todd was subsequently murdered by the joker in the storyline a death in the family in which the psychopath beat the youngster severely with a crowbar and left him to die in a warehouse rigged with a bomb jason todd later returned as the new red hood the original alias of the joker when he was brought back to life due to reality being altered after the continuity changes following the new 52 dc comics relaunch jason becomes a leader of the outlaws a superhero team that includes starfire and arsenal who had spent years with grayson in the titans tim drake main article tim drake tim drake in batman 457 december 1990 showcasing a redesigned robin costume art by norm breyfogle dc comics was left uncertain about readers decision to have jason todd killed wondering if readers preferred batman as a lone vigilante disliked todd specifically or just wanted to see if dc would actually kill off the character in addition the 1989 batman film did not feature robin giving dc a reason to keep him out of the comic book series for marketing purposes regardless batman editor denny o neil introduced a new robin the third robin timothy drake first appeared in a flashback in batman 436 1989 as a preadolescent boy introduced by writer marv wolfman interior penciler pat broderick and inker john beatty drake s first name was a nod to tim burton director of the 1989 batman film the character first donned the robin costume and became associated with the third version of robin in the acclaimed a lonely place of dying sequel storyline which culminated in issue 442 written by marv wolfman with cover art by george pérez storyline interior pencils by pérez tom grummett as well as jim aparo and inks by mike decarlo in addition to establishing tim drake as a principal character in batman and detective comics lauren r o connor argues that a lonely place of dying served as the dénouement of a transition from dick grayson s absent sexuality which earlier incited reader interpretations of homosexuality to definitive heterosexual presence as a maturation narrative o connor offers multiple examples from this 1989 storyline such as drake s encounter with starfire and grayson s heeding of drake s concerns over batman s psychology to substantiate the notion of a heterosexual bildungsroman subplot 7 the ensuing tim drake storylines authored by the late alan grant and penciled by the late norm breyfogle coupled with the 1989 release of burton s batman spurred sales of both batman and detective comics for the latter title grant attested in 2007 that when the batman movie came out the sales went up if i recall correctly from around 75 000 to about 675 000 1989 90 was indeed the year of the bat capital and diamond city distributors reported that the year one inspired batman legends of the dark knight dominated four out of the five spots for preorders not total sales and second printings the only exception was the third preorder spot snagged by batman 442 the conclusion to tim drake s a lonely place of dying storyline 8 the year of the bat continued into the first half of 1990 preorders for batman and detective comics issues featuring a revived joker and penguin began to compete with and even edged out the last three parts of grant morrison s and klaus janson s gothic storyline in legends todd mcfarlane s spider man arrived in the second half of 1990 inaugurating six months of spidermania or mcfarlamania depending on the reader 9 dc closed out 1990 with vendors under ordering issues prompting the publisher to push batman 457 and the first part of the robin mini series into second and then third printings the next year 1991 witnessed the ascension of chris claremont s jim lee s and scott williams s x men against magneto as well as fabian nicieza s and rob liefeld s x force into the top of the preorder rankings the only exception to this x mania was again tim drake and the sequel to the robin miniseries the first variant issue of which garnered the third spot firmly wedged between variant issues of x force and x men the mini series pitted solo robin against the joker in response to fan demands for a matchup since a death in the family the 1990s comic booming bust had begun 10 in a supplemental interview with daniel best alan grant added that every issue from about that time after the year of the bat that featured robin sales went up because robin did have his own fans although both grant and breyfogle initially believed that their anarky character could potentially become the third version of robin they were quick to support the editorial decision to focus on drake the social anarchist duo adopted the character as their own in the early 1990s during grant s shift to libertarian socialism but before his late 1990s emphasis on neo tech breyfogle agreed that it was a big thing to bring in the new robin yes i know my fans often point specifically to that double page splash where his costume first appears as a big event for them as fans and i usually have to point out to them that neal adams was the one who designed the costume the r symbol and the staff were all that was really mine in the rite of passage storyline for detective comics grant and breyfogle intertwined 1 drake matching wits with anarky 2 a criminal and anthropological investigation into an apocryphal haitian vodou cult revealed by batman asserting anthropological and investigative authority as a front for extortion and crony capitalism 3 the murder of drake s mother by vilified cult leaders 4 the beginning of drake s recurrent nightmares and trauma as well as 5 the perspective of a child of one of the cult s haitian followers unknowingly and inadvertently orphaned by batman at the end of the four issue arc 11 tim drake eventually transitioned from late preadolescence to adolescence becoming the third robin over the course of the storylines rite of passage 12 and identity crisis 13 with all issues scripted by alan grant and penciled by norm breyfogle story arcs that included drake only in subplots or featured his training in criminal investigation such as crimesmith 14 and the penguin affair 15 were either written or co written by grant and wolfman with pencils by breyfogle aparo and m d bright immediately afterwards the character starred in the five issue miniseries robin 16 written by chuck dixon with interior pencils by tom lyle and cover art by brian bolland the new batman and robin team went on their first official mission together in the story debut 17 again written by grant and penciled by breyfogle lauren r o connor contends that in early tim drake appearances writers such as grant and chuck dixon had a lexicon of teenage behavior from which to draw unlike when dick grayson was introduced and the concept of the teenager was still nascent they wisely mobilized the expected adolescent behaviors of parental conflict hormonal urges and identity formation to give tim emotional depth and complexity making him a relatable character with boundaries between his two selves in the robin ongoing series when drake had fully transitioned into an adolescent character chuck dixon depicted him as engaging in adolescent intimacy yet still stopped short at overt heterosexual consummation this narrative benchmark maintained robin s estrangement from sex that began in the grayson years 18 erica mccrystal likewise observes that alan grant prior to dixon s series connected drake to batman s philosophy of heroic or anti heroic vigilantism as therapeutic for children of trauma but this kind of therapy has a delicate integration process the overcoming of trauma entailed distinct identity intersections and emotional restraint as well as a complete understanding of symbol and self bruce wayne a former child of trauma guided other trauma victims down a path of righteousness tim drake for example endured trauma and emotional duress as a result of the death of his mother father in a coma and on a ventilator drake contemplated the idea of fear and overcoming it in both the rite of passage and identity crisis storylines grant and breyfogle subjected drake to recurrent nightmares from hauntings by a ghoulish batman to the disquieting lullaby or informal nursery rhyme my mummy s dead my mummy s dead i can t get it through my head echoing across a cemetery for deceased parents drake ultimately defeated his own preadolescent fears somewhat distant from bruce wayne and not as an orphan by the end of identity crisis an adolescent drake had proven himself as capable of being a vigilante by deducing the role of fear in instigating a series of violent crimes 19 in the comics tim drake was a late preadolescent boy who had followed the adventures of batman and robin ever since witnessing the murder of the flying graysons this served to connect drake to grayson establishing a link that dc hoped would help readers accept this new robin drake surmised their secret identities with his amateur but instinctive detective skills and followed their careers closely tim stated on numerous occasions that he wishes to become the world s greatest detective a title currently belonging to the dark knight batman himself stated that one day drake will surpass him as a detective despite his combat skills not being the match of grayson s although there are some similarities in that they are far superior to todd s when he was robin his detective skills more than make up for this in addition batman supplied him with a new armored costume for his transition to the adolescent robin 20 tim drake s first robin costume had a red torso yellow stitching and belt black boots and green short sleeves gloves pants and domino mask he wore a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside this costume had an armored tunic and gorget an emergency r shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs and a collapsible bo staff as his primary weapon which tim drake continues to use as the superhero red robin neal adams redesigned the entire costume with the exception of the r shuriken logo first sketched by norm breyfogle 21 tim drake is the first robin to have his own comic book series where he fought crime on his own tim drake as robin co founded the superhero team young justice in the absence of the teen titans of dick grayson s generation but would then later re form the teen titans after young justice disbanded following a massive sidekick crossover during which donna troy was killed tim served as leader of this version of the titans until 2009 at which point he quit due to the events of batman r i p following infinite crisis and 52 tim drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend superboy kon el who died fighting earth prime superboy this robin costume had a red torso long sleeves and pants it also included black gloves and boots yellow stitching and belt and a black and yellow cape tim drake continued the motif of a red and black costume when he assumed the role of red robin before and during the events of the new 52 tim drake assumes the identity of the red robin after batman s disappearance following the events of final crisis and battle for the cowl and damian wayne becoming grayson s robin following 2011 s continuity changes resulting from the new 52 dc comics relaunch history was altered such that tim drake never took up the robin mantle after jason todd s death feeling that it would be inappropriate instead he served as batman s sidekick under the name of the red robin however in dc s rebirth relaunch his original origin was restored stephanie brown stephanie brown on the cover of robin 80th anniversary 100 page super spectacular 1

with his father who vowed never to take a life originally conceived to become a host for his maternal grandfather s soul as well as a pawn against the dark knight batman saved his child from this fate which forced ra s to inhabit his own son s body and thus damian was affectionate to his father after batman s apparent death during final crisis talia left her son under dick grayson and alfred pennyworth s care and damian was deeply affected by his father s absence in the first issue of battle for the cowl damian was driving the batmobile and was attacked by poison ivy and killer croc

adopted the mantle of batman and instead of having tim who he viewed as an equal rather than a protégé remain as robin he gave the role to damian who he felt needed the training that his father would have given him following the batman the return of bruce wayne and flashpoint events bruce wayne returned to his role as batman while dick resumed as nightwing as of the new 52 damian continued to work

robin complete with the original costume in order to learn the basics of detective work from a famous detective named harvey harris the purpose of the secret identity was to prevent harris from learning wayne s true motivation for approaching him which could have led to the detective attempting to discourage the boy from pursuing his obsession 27 though this story remained canonical through most of the 1980s it was revisited in the three issue miniseries the untold legend of the batman in 1980 it was revised post crisis to edit out any reference to bruce wayne having ever called himself
