weapon assigned to each member of the green lantern corps 1 the corps was in the process of recruiting 7 200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain parallax the rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer and thus the ring which includes a sentient computer frees kol from his bonds and allows him to escape his captors his fellow prisoner begs to be taken also but kol refuses believing the man to have actually earned his fate 1 kol is
