justice league of america vol 3 7 2 also titled killer frost 1 17 she can also be seen on the cover of forever evil 1 which hints at her involvement in that series where she s revealed to be dr caitlin snow a scientist sent to s t a r labs outpost 72 in the arctic to work on a thermodynamic engine whose creator had committed suicide snow soon discovered the place had been infiltrated by h i v e agents when they tried to kill her inside the engine snow frantically ripped off the coolant system merging her body with ice transformed into a heat vampire she killed the h i v e agents out of revenge she then wandered out into the cold until she came across a norwegian camp and took their heat too hijacking a helicopter she made it back to her hometown pittsburgh she even created a suit that helped her retain heat for longer she later encountered the superhero firestorm and discovered that his powers could temporarily heal her mutation she tried recreating the firestorm nuclear matrix several times only to fail with each attempt when firestorm and the justice league were declared dead by the crime syndicate she lost hope for a cure to her condition 18 killer frost later has

where they learned that to free the justice league they needed wonder woman s lasso of truth discovering cheetah was keeping it as a trophy they found her and her menagerie but were subdued doctor light arthur light suddenly appeared and blasted everyone except frost and trevor unconscious after defeating him they managed to deliver the lasso of truth to cyborg who successfully used it to free his teammates 19 dc rebirth edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2017 in dc rebirth caitlin snow is taken to belle reve penitentiary where she is introduced to the suicide squad and offered a place on the team by amanda waller she accepts and joins the team she helps the suicide squad in their fight against the justice league but subsequently assists them against maxwell lord when he is possessed by eclipso whose attempt to tap into her darkest desire only unlocks her desire to make a difference she then has to save all the suicide squad and the justice league by absorbing the energy out of superman and using it against lord afterwards waller is forced to release snow into batman s custody 20 she then joined the new justice league of america made up of batman the atom lobo black canary vixen and the ray powers and abilities edit all versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold using these powers killer frost can create an ice sheen across her entire body that grants her increased durability cause intense blizzards that can instantly freeze the target and generate objects composed completely of ice such as projectiles in the form of ice shards and defensive walls or shields she can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them although she is able to kiss people who can can cool her down and negate her cryo kinetic abilities like firestorm her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice although heat based weapons such as flamethrowers only make her stronger she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow the caitlin snow version of killer frost is constantly plagued by a hunger for heat which can only be sated by absorbing the heat from a living being a process which inevitably kills the victim however in recent stories she seems to have finally gotten it under control by only absorbing a tiny amount of heat from every person she touches sparing them and leaving them otherwise unharmed the caitlin snow and louise lincoln versions of the character have albeit inconsistently demonstrated the ability to fly either by riding arctic winds or through an unknown manner of self propulsion while the exact limits of her abilities have yet to be established how much power frost can channel at once seems to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body for example when she absorbed all the heat from superman whose body is supercharged by yellow solar energy during a stand off between the justice league and the suicide squad she was able to flash freeze the entire league in a single blast it also seems that using up all the heat energy she has stored can put frost s life in danger if she does not feed in time she even risks dying of starvation the caitlin snow version also boasts a genius level intellect being s t a r labs youngest and brightest scientist prior to her transformation she could solve complex equations easily operate heavy energy generating machinery and appeared particularly skilled in the field of physics and research about energy she once managed to create an ice prism with her powers that converted superman s heat vision into a bright burst of sunlight to defeat eclipso several adaptations of the villain have also depicted the crystal frost and louise lincoln incarnations as having basic skills in melee combat which they use in conjunction with their powers as well as impressive agility being able to perform maneuvers such as leaps or cartwheels with ease other versions edit dc super friends
