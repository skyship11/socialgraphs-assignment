team but she ll be around and we ll learn more about her and her last name is no accident if there s another character in the dcu named fortune but probably in a different way than you might expect 1 fictional character biography edit while the jsa all stars were struggling in a battle against the king of tears a powerful beast summoned by johnny sorrow anna fortune instantly appeared in the scene after leaving her boyfriend wildcat at home and took out a gauntlet and trapped the king of tears in it she soon revealed to the team that dr fate sent her to help the team saying that he once helped her out of a jam she then instantly began to calibrate a spell that would transport everyone to the subtle realms which is where an all star teammate stargirl was trapped 2 once she cast the spell chaos ensued as they were brought to the subtle realms and when she admitted she got the spell wrong and accidentally released the king of tears anna could not undo her mistake but helped fight alongside the all stars against the king of tears until stargirl managed to kill the king of tears by stabbing it in its heart when the team returned to their base anna joined the team 3 while going on a mission to parador atom smasher asked anna what her story was and about her connection with dr fate anna did not reveal what her story was and once again stated that dr fate got her out of a jam she also mentioned that the only flying machines they have in my day are hot air balloons suggesting she comes from the past most likely the 19th or very early 20th century 4 following this mission she had a flirting conversation with atom smasher in which she told him she was either twenty six or a hundred and eighty seven suggesting her home time period is 1849 5 powers and abilities edit anna
