other members of the zatara family zachary is able to manipulate magic by speaking spells backwards so far his powers have been shown to affect inanimate objects summon simple objects into existence and transmogrify one object to another it is unknown how his magical strength level compares with his cousin zatanna his main limitation if compared to his older cousin is his inability to affect living beings directly however he has shown the ability to make doves appear out of his hat and grant superman a few minutes of sunlight energy by indirectly manipulating the inanimate elements surrounding the living entities like zatanna he s a clever illusionist and showman even without resorting to his magic albeit more inclined to brag and abuse his position while zatanna is a widely accepted member of the justice league and an entertainer loved by her public zatara is considered somewhat of a selfish brat as insufferable in a team as he is successful onstage appearance edit in his appearance in 52 keith giffen drew zatara in fishnets like his cousin zatanna as a joke stating as a goof in the breakdowns i drew that new zatara kid in zatanna s fishnets and corset getup the penciler actually drew him that way my pleas to let it go through like that went unheeded 9 10 11 other versions edit kingdom come edit kingdom come features a character named zatara who is similar to
