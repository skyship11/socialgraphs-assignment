strange 35 and is notably one of dc comics s first muslim characters to headline a solo series 63 unlike the other incarnations the character s designation as doctor fate comes from both a cultural

helmet of anubis helmet of thoth or helm of thoth is a magical corinthian helmet that grants the bearer godly level powers and is considered one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the dc universe while most continuities establish it to be a creation of nabu the fourth doctor fate series presents a different origin the helm instead associated with thoth and is presented with an altered origin the object of power being rooted in the dc s version of egyptian mythology being a creation of osiris and thoth s hand it was created in order to trap nabu who once served alongside thoth for reasons not revealed 64 acting as a respository of magical energy the helm was constructed using the fictitious metal known as nth metal granting it mystical properties as well as some anti magic

helm itself enough to require regeneration showcasing a vulnerability to powerful forms of magic and applications from the firestorm matrix 72 71 the helm can also be overload with magical power rendering much of its power inert this took place during the a costly trick of magic storyline when nabu and nelson sacrificed themselves to creating a spell powerful enough to injure upside down man leaving khalid s incarnation of doctor fate unable to call upon its powers 65 amulet of anubis edit the amulet of anubis sometimes called the amulet of nabu or the amulet of thoth is an amulet that

magical cloak the amulet affords several abilities including resistance to psychic astral probing allows for mind control and bolsters a user s magical power 73 while seldomly used by doctor fate himself the amulet also allows for the wearer to call upon the decease spirits allowing him to commune with spirits 74 as well as houses its own universe separate from the main universe allowing the wearer to hide their existence or to trap powerful entities within the amulet s history was revised several times in one story the amulet of anubis was a powerful artifact forged by the lords of order at the dawn of time being so powerful the lords of chaos formerly sought the artifact themselves eventually it came into nabu s possession to be granted to his chosen agent 75 other artifacts edit cloak of destiny a magical cloak with mystic properities the cloak is both fireproof 76 and highly resistant towards some forms of magic in the dc universe jared stevens notably used it to suppress

including once having a protector in the form of typhon a lord of chaos who was an enemy of doctor fate and later protectred the tower from intruders 80 patrons edit throughout the character s history several beings have acted as doctor fate s patron granting the character formidable powers name description lords of order nabu the guiding force and primary patron of most incarnations of doctor fate nabu is a mesopotamian deity one of the lords of order and mentor of several incarnations of doctor fate nabu s relationship with his doctor fate hosts is characterized differently between each incarnations having been depicted as an overbearing figure whose dedication to his goal makes him willing to supplanting the will of his hosts in some depictions he is callous and in others comes to feel regret for it he has also been depicted as an insightful but cryptic and vague mentor while inhabiting the helm of fate nabu s patronage allows for the bearer to have potential access to all of his knowledge magical energy and power and can assist his bearers with his insight and thoughts with his role having been once compared to an ai however this leaves a host vulnerable to nabu who can also usurp control of his bearer s will and body by force shat ru shat ru s patronage allowed kent nelson to regain a connection to the lords of order in a similar method to witchcraft through the use of familiars granting him magical powers and the ability to cast spells comparable to his time as doctor fate under nabu s patron unlike his prior patronage with nabu shat ru s patronage is connected to a makeshift half helmet kent created earlier in his superhero career and lacks the inherent knowledge granted to him through the helmet of fate 81 egyptian deities thoth in the new 52 continuity the helmet of fate s origin changed during the 2015 doctor fate series renamed the helmet of thoth it s powers originating from the egyptian god thoth with nabu acting as the helmet s guiding intelligence spirit due to having once served as thoth s servant in his lifetime unlike other patrons thoth s power was represented solely through the helm and did not require him within the helm to bestow his power 64 later accounts of the helm of fate s history conflicts with earlier statements attributing the powers of the helm back to nabu during the series run thoth s patronage to the helm allowed for specific powers not previously attributed to other depictions of the helm such as native control over the elements wind earth fire water electricity and healing abilities like other iterations of the helmet prior thoth s patron also similarly granted a level of enhanced intellgience and spell casting 64 hauhet some time after the helmet of fate having been damaged during a battle with the entity referred to as the upside down man the helmet of fate lost much of its power for a time although it mysteriously gained newer abilities it is revealed later by wonder woman that the egyptian goddess hauhet currently inhabited the helm in some manner and has since been sending messages to the bearerer khalid nassour 82 due to her divine sphere of influence within space and time the helm of fate is capable of seeing through multiple timelines although much of its abilities is shown in a damage state costing some of the bearer s sight to see into the future 82 the future state event showcases the helm s repaired power with hauhet as its patron allowing the bearer to see both different timelines and experience them individually without costing the bearer s sight 66 lords of chaos chaos inza cramer s version of doctor fate was later revealed to be powered by a lord of chaos simply known as chaos chaos would claim that his influence over inza was subtle and allowed free will due to believing the evil she fought being an opponent to the lord of chaos s objectives inherently along with amusement over the confusion of the lords of chaos fighting evil 79 with chaos s patronage he allows his agent to practice chaos magic allowing them to perform magical feats powered by imagination 79 although later establishment of chaos magic refer to this form of magic as a form of magic that requires no system sigils chanting etc to perform 50 weaknesses edit despite the character s portrayal of powers doctor fate has several weaknesses dependent on the incarnation removal the helm of fate on doctor fate can remove their powers or limit their abilities severely 61 several incarnations of doctor fate suffer from this weakness including both the original kent nelson whom can only cast a limited amount of spells alone and possess no power to channel magic without a lord of order patron 83 and his grand nephew kent v nelson 61 due to the rules of magic doctor fate is unable to cast counter spells against himself to nullify another spell after they ve been cast the character only able to use his powers to protect him from the effects of whatever spell has been cast afterwards this limitation is present on kent nelson s incarnation of doctor fate 25 84 85 the kent nelson incarnation of doctor fate has also fallen victim to gas attacks and lack of oxygen without
