marvel family into their dc universe and has attempted to revive the property several times with mixed success owing to trademark conflicts over other characters named captain marvel owned by marvel

appeared in whiz comics 2 feb 1940 art by c c beck after the success of national comics new superhero characters superman and batman fawcett publications started its own comics division in 1939 recruiting staff writer bill parker to create several hero characters for the first title in their line tentatively titled flash comics besides penning stories featuring his creations ibis the invincible the spy smasher the golden arrow lance o casey scoop smith and dan dare for the new book parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes each superhero in this team possessed a special power granted to them by a mythological figure 12 fawcett comics executive director ralph daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers parker responded by creating a character he called captain thunder 12 staff artist charles clarence c c beck was recruited to design and illustrate parker s story rendering it in a direct somewhat cartoony style that became his trademark when bill parker and i went to work on fawcett s first comic book in late 1939 we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were beck told an interviewer we decided to give our reader a real comic book drawn in comic strip style and telling an imaginative story based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine but going back to the old folk tales and myths of classic times 13 the first issue of the comic book printed as both flash comics 1 and thrill comics 1 14 had a low print run in the fall of 1939 as an ashcan copy created for advertising and trademark purposes shortly after its printing however fawcett found it could not trademark captain thunder flash comics or thrill comics because all three names were already in use consequently the book was renamed whiz comics and fawcett artist pete costanza suggested changing captain thunder s name to captain marvelous which the editors shortened to captain marvel the word balloons in the story were re lettered to label the hero of the main story as captain marvel introduction edit whiz comics 2 cover dated feb 1940 was published in late 1939 captain marvel the comic s lead feature introduced audiences to billy batson an orphaned 12 year old boy who by speaking the name of the ancient wizard shazam is struck by a magic lightning bolt and

other fawcett books including master comics inspiration and success at fawcett edit whiz comics 22 oct 1941 featuring captain marvel and his young alter ego billy batson art by c c beck inspiration for captain marvel came from a number of sources his visual appearance was modeled after that of fred macmurray a popular american actor of the period 16 though comparisons with both cary grant and jack oakie were made as well 17 fawcett publications founder wilford h fawcett was nicknamed captain billy which inspired the name billy batson as well as marvel s title 18 fawcett s earliest magazine was titled captain billy s whiz bang which inspired the title whiz comics 19 in addition fawcett took several of the elements that had made superman the first popular comic book superhero super strength and speed science fiction stories a mild mannered reporter alter ego and incorporated them into captain marvel fawcett s circulation director roscoe kent fawcett recalled telling the staff give me a superman only have his other identity be a 10 or 12 year old boy rather than a man 20 through much of the golden age of comic books captain marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium and his comics outsold all others captain marvel adventures sold fourteen million copies in 1944 21 and was at one point being published bi weekly with a circulation of 1 3 million copies an issue several issues of captain marvel adventures included a blurb on their covers proclaiming the series the largest circulation of any comic magazine 3 the franchise was expanded

appearing as the lead features in master comics and wow comics respectively 22 captain marvel captain marvel jr and mary marvel appeared together as a team in another fawcett publication the marvel family 22 in addition there was a talking animal spin off character hoppy the marvel bunny which was created in 1942 for fawcett s funny animals comic book and later given an eponymous series as well 22 with bill parker having been drafted into world war ii chief writing duties on the captain marvel related comics stories went to otto binder by 1942 23 c c beck remained as lead artist and he and binder steered the captain marvel stories towards a whimsical tone that emphasized comedy and fantasy elements alongside the superhero action other artists associated with the marvel family at fawcett included pete costanza mac rayboy marc swayze and kurt schaffenberger 24 otto binder would write over 900 of the approximately 1 790 captain marvel related stories published by fawcett 23 several of captain marvel s enduring supporting characters and enemies including the non powered uncle marvel tawky tawny the talking tiger and the villains mister mind and black adam were created by binder during the mid to late 1940s 25 copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation edit captain marvel co creator c c beck was the chief artist on the character throughout its golden age run at fawcett and illustrated stories for the first 10 issues of dc comics 1970s shazam revival series see also national comics publications inc v fawcett publications inc detective comics later known as national comics publications national periodical publications and today known as dc comics sued both fawcett comics and republic pictures for copyright infringement in 1941 alleging that captain marvel was based on their character superman 26 after seven years of litigation national comics publications inc v fawcett publications inc went to trial in 1948 although the presiding judge decided that captain marvel was an infringement dc was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their superman daily newspaper strips and it was decided that national had abandoned the superman copyright 27 as a result the initial verdict delivered in 1951 went in fawcett s favor national appealed this decision and judge learned hand declared in 1952 that national s superman copyright was in fact valid judge hand did not find that the character of captain marvel itself was an infringement but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements and this would have to be determined in a retrial he therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination 27 instead of retrying the case however fawcett settled with national out of court the national lawsuit was not the only problem fawcett faced in regard to captain marvel while captain marvel adventures had been the top selling comic series during world war ii it suffered declining sales every year after 1945 and by 1949 it was selling only half its wartime rate 28 fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its captain marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that had gained popularity at the time 29 feeling that this decline in the popularity of superhero comics meant that it was no longer worth continuing the fight 30 fawcett agreed on august 14 1953 to permanently cease publication of comics with the captain marvel related characters and to pay national 400 000 in damages 4 31 fawcett shut down its comics division in the autumn of 1953 and fired its

the magic bunny with all references to captain marvel and shazam removed 22 marvelman miracleman edit main article marvelman in the 1950s a small british publisher l miller and son published a number of black and white reprints of american comic books including the captain marvel series with the outcome of the national v fawcett lawsuit l miller and son found their supply of captain marvel material abruptly cut off they requested the help of a british comic writer mick anglo who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called marvelman captain marvel jr was adapted to create young marvelman while mary marvel had her sex changed to create the male kid marvelman the magic word shazam was replaced with kimota atomik spelled backwards the new characters took over the numbering of the original captain marvel s united kingdom series with issue number 25 marvelman ceased publication in 1963 but the character was revived in 1982 by writer alan moore in the pages of warrior magazine beginning in 1985 moore s black and white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by eclipse comics under the new title miracleman as marvel comics objected to the use of marvel in the title and continued publication in the united states after warrior s demise within the metatextual story line of the comic series itself it was noted that marvelman s creation was based upon captain marvel comics by both moore and later marvelman miracleman writer neil gaiman in 2009 marvel comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s marvelman characters and stories and later purchased the rights to the 1980s version and those reprints in 2013 34 35 m f enterprises edit main article captain marvel m f enterprises in 1966 m f enterprises produced their own captain marvel an

fawcett was unable to revive captain marvel having agreed to never publish the character again as part of their 1953 settlement looking for new properties to introduce to the dc comics line dc publisher carmine infantino decided to bring the captain marvel property back into print on june 16 1972 dc entered into an agreement with fawcett to license the captain marvel and marvel family characters 31 39 because marvel comics had by this time established captain marvel as a comic book trademark for their own character created and first published in 1967 dc published their book under the name shazam 5 infantino attempted to give the shazam book the subtitle the original captain marvel but a cease and desist letter from marvel comics forced them to change the subtitle to the world s mightiest mortal starting with shazam 15 december 1974 39 as all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character have also been required to use the shazam label with little to no mention of the name captain marvel the title became so linked to captain marvel that many people took to identifying the character as shazam instead of captain marvel 7 the shazam comic series began with shazam 1 feb 1973 it contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s dennis o neil was the primary writer of the book 40 his role was later taken over by writers elliot s maggin and e nelson bridwell c c beck drew stories for the first 10 issues of the book before quitting because of creative differences bob oksner and fawcett alumnus kurt schaffenberger were among the later artists of the title as per dc s agreement with fawcett dc paid fawcett and after 1977 its successor cbs publications a licensing fee per issue per page for each of the fawcett characters who appeared either in shazam or crossovers in other comic series 41 with dc s multiverse concept in effect during this time the revived marvel family and related characters lived within the dc universe on the parallel world of earth s 39 the fawcett material was still considered canon with the marvel family s 20 year layoff explained in the comic as time spent in suspended animation due to doctor sivana 39 while the series began with a great deal of fanfare the book had a lackluster reception 39 the creators themselves had misgivings beck said as an illustrator i could in the old days make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings but i couldn t bring the new captain marvel stories to life no matter how hard i tried 42 shazam was heavily rewritten as of issue 34 april 1978 and bridwell provided more realistic stories accompanied by similar art the first issue was drawn by alan weiss and joe rubinstein and thereafter by don newton a longtime fan of the character 43 and schaffenberger nevertheless the next issue was the last one though the feature was kept alive in a back up position in the dollar comics formatted run of world s finest comics from 253 october november 1978 to 282 august 1982 skipping only 271 which featured a full length origin of the superman batman team story 44 45 schaffenberger left the feature after 259 and the inking credit subsequently varied when world s finest comics reverted to the standard 36 pages leftover shazam material saw publication in adventure comics 491 492 september october 1982 the remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints with shazam represented by mostly fawcett era stories left out of adventure comics 500 and the final 503 where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs outside of their regular series and features the marvel family characters also appeared as guest stars in the justice league of america series in particular issues 135 137 vol 1 for the

marvel and often the marvel family also co starred with superman in several issues of dc comics presents written by roy thomas 49 roy thomas a veteran comic book writer and editor had been lured from marvel comics to dc in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of shazam and the justice society of america characters 41 49 the marvels also guest starred in several issues of all star squadron a series centered on the justice society and the other earth 2 characters written by roy thomas and his wife dann as all star squadron was set during world war ii several events of the comic fell concurrent with and referenced the events of the original early 1940s fawcett stories 50 with their 1985 crisis on infinite earths miniseries dc fully integrated the characters into the dc universe captain marvel in the late 1980s edit the first post crisis appearance of captain marvel was in the 1986 legends miniseries in 1987 captain marvel appeared as a member of the justice league in keith giffen s and j m dematteis relaunch of that title that same year spinning off from legends he was given his own miniseries titled shazam the new beginning with this four issue miniseries writers roy and dann thomas and artist tom mandrake attempted to re launch the captain marvel mythos and bring the wizard shazam dr sivana uncle dudley and black adam into the modern dc universe with an altered origin story the most notable change that the thomases giffen and dematteis introduced into the captain marvel mythos was that the personality of young billy batson is retained when he transforms into the captain this change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny golden age personality in the darker modern day comic book world instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986 which tended to treat captain marvel and billy as two separate personalities 51 this revised version of captain marvel also appeared in one story arc featured in the short lived anthology action comics weekly 623 626 october 25 1988 november 15 1988 in which a neo nazi version of captain nazi was introduced 41 at the end of the arc it was announced that this would lead to a new shazam ongoing series 41 though new beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book it never saw publication owing to editorial disputes between dc comics and roy thomas 49 as a result thomas s intended revival of the marvel family with a new punk styled mary bromfield mary marvel a k a spike who was not billy s sister and an african american take on freddy freeman captain marvel jr did not see print 41 thomas departed dc in 1989 not long after his removal from the shazam project 41 other attempts at reviving shazam were initiated over the next three years including a reboot project by john byrne illustrator of legends and writer artist on the superman reboot miniseries the man of steel 1986 52 53 none of these versions saw print though captain marvel the wizard shazam and black adam did appear in dc s war of the gods miniseries in 1991 by this time dc had ended the fee per use licensing agreement with cbs publications and purchased the full rights to captain marvel and the other fawcett comics characters 41 the power of shazam 1994 1995 1999 edit main article the power of shazam in 1991 jerry ordway was given the shazam assignment which he pitched as a painted graphic novel that would lead into a series rather than starting the series outright 41 ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel titled the power of shazam which was released in 1994 power of shazam retconned captain marvel again and gave him a revised origin rendering shazam the new beginning and the action comics weekly story apocryphal while marvel s appearances in legends and justice league still counted as part of the continuity 54 ordway s story more closely followed captain marvel s fawcett origins with only slight additions and changes the graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success leading to a power of shazam ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999 55 that series

because of his misfortune he had been thrown out by a greedy uncle who stole his inheritance following the deaths of his parents later retellings of the origin would also note that billy was chosen

wizard shazam declares the new hero captain marvel and orders him to carry on his work as a stone block suspended above his throne falls upon him killing him as prophesied 86 the wizard would return

adventures feature him as a solo hero he also fought evil on a regular basis accompanied by several other kids who share his powers to make up a superhero team called the marvel family later referred to as the shazam family owing to the issues dc comics faced over the marvel and captain marvel trademarks the first members of the family introduced in whiz comics 21 sept 1941 and used sparingly

of billy s father in this version 85 both the thomases and ordway s retellings of the origin directly tie the need for the wizard shazam to draft a younger replacement to the coming re emergence of black adam the wizard s first champion from the days of ancient egypt who became evil and was due to escape thousands of years of banishment 85 96 ordway s origin added the extra element of black adam s alter ego descendant theo adam being the murderer of billy s parents 85 the subsequent power of shazam ongoing series features billy now 14 97 meeting his long lost sister mary and best friend freddy freeman 98 and establishing the marvel family as in the fawcett comics 99 the marvels home base of fawcett city is depicted as a city full of old fashioned traditions and architecture later establishing that the wizard shazam placed a spell on the city broken in later issues that slowed time to a crawl in 1955 100 this phenomenon was used to explain the marvel family s sometimes anachronistic approaches to life and heroism compared to many of their contemporary heroes in the dc universe 101 in 2012 writer and then dc chief creative officer geoff johns revised billy batson s origin for dc s new 52 universe also renaming the character s alter ego as shazam at this time in his new origin story billy batson is a moody and troubled 15 year old foster child living in

good the world dragged billy down to its level in desperation and seeing the embers of good within billy the dying wizard passes on his powers and teaches billy they can be accessed through the magic

sealed off area of the rock an abandoned train station leading to the seven realms of an unexplored world known as the magic lands 112 powers and abilities edit while normally having no special abilities in his human persona as billy batson once he says the magic word shazam he transforms into a full grown man in peak physical condition endowed with multiple superpowers that rank him amongst the most powerful entities in the dc universe billy is also able to share his powers with others the letters in the name shazam each represent a specific superhuman ability s for the wisdom of solomon billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge he possesses excellent mental acuity and nearly infallible wisdom including an innate understanding of virtually all known languages and sciences and has a photographic memory and perfect recall being able to retain full knowledge of all he experiences with perfect clarity from this he can read and decipher any coding solve long mathematical equations instantaneously and make intuitive guesses based on limited data which are almost always correct he also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world an uncanny awareness of his circumstances akin to clairvoyance that lets him turn disadvantages into advantages and can provide counselling and advice in times of need in some stories this power also gives him the ability to hypnotize people 113 h for the strength of hercules the might of hercules grants superhuman strength comparable to that of the legendary demigod making him one of dc comics strongest characters he is able to easily bend steel in his bare hands do the work of several laborers in a fraction of the time produce powerful shockwaves by clapping his hands punch through nearly any structure and lift and toss massive objects this strength has been compared to that of superman and other godlike characters 114 the strength of the golden age captain marvel was unlimited 115 116 and the character was strong enough to move stars and planets 115 117 118 119 a for the stamina of atlas using atlas stamina grants near limitless resilience he never feels fatigued or tired and as

discomfort or lingering signs of the harm he has a supernaturally endowed metabolism far beyond the normal realm of human physical activities doesn t require nourishment or even air although he can partake of them for personal enjoyment and he can even survive unaided in space sustained by the magical energies coursing through his body billy s empowered form ages very slowly allowing him to potentially live for thousands of years in his empowered form 120 121 122 although his normal self will continue to age 123 z for the power of zeus zeus power besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms captain marvel shazam also greatly enhances captain marvel shazam s other physical and mental abilities including his five senses and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks 124 the hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target 125 126 the magic lightning has several uses such as creating apparatus restoring damage done to the hero and providing fuel for magic spells it allows him to travel to the rock of eternity thus allowing interdimensional and time travel the current continuity version of shazam is able to use his lightning powers to absorb lightning and electricity as well as conjure and generate lightning which he can control for various uses such as shooting energy bolts and creating electrical force fields 105 a for the courage of achilles this aspect is mostly psychological and spiritual in nature the courage of achilles confers the mental fortitude of the legendary greek hero which gives him superhuman levels of inner strength willpower discipline and resolve from which to draw upon in times of hopelessness he is constantly supported by a harmonious sense of good will and unflinching courage and he never backs down from a challenge or feels any debilitating amount of fear or despair even in the face of the most intimidating of opponents in some stories it also gives him fighting skills 127 it also aids the hero s mental fortitude against telepathy mind control and other mental attacks in some stories being powered by achilles also provided billy with the hero s near invulnerability 128 m for the speed of mercury by channeling mercury s speed captain marvel shazam can move at superhuman speeds comparable to the flash and fly at supersonic speed he is able to move at sub light speeds in orbit and in outer space he can fly at trans light speeds although in older comics he could only leap great distances the pre 1985 stories also let him travel to the rock of eternity by flying faster than the speed of light 129 in classic stories simply saying the word shazam transformed billy into captain marvel shazam and back again 130 this extended to accidental utterances recorded playbacks and so forth 131 when captain marvel shazam shared his powers with his marvel shazam family teammates in 1990s and 2000s dc publications from the power of shazam in 1995 through 2011 s flashpoint the shazam power was depicted as a finite source which would be divided into halves thirds or further depending upon how many marvels were super powered at one time and weakening them accordingly 132 captain marvel shazam is not completely invulnerable in several stories he is shown to be susceptible to high powered magic 133 which can weaken or de power him 133 and in some older stories to significantly high voltages of lightning or electricity which would make him revert to billy batson form 134 despite possessing the courage of achilles the fawcett captain marvel was extremely bashful and shy around attractive women a weakness some villains came to exploit 135 136 most depictions following the crisis on infinite earths also show his childlike innocence and immaturity to be a significant weakness 82 jerry ordway s 1990s the power of shazam series also gave billy the added ability to alter captain marvel s appearance to his will by visualizing alterations and then saying shazam 137 billy uses this ability to disguise himself as his uncle to work and cash checks 138 and to turn his captain marvel costume into a spacesuit for a mission in space 139 in the late 2000s when billy replaced the wizard and took on a white costume and the name of marvel he commanded the various magical abilities once possessed by the wizard however he was also required to remain on the rock of eternity and could only be away from it for 24 hours at a time 140 since the 2011 reboot shazam s powers have been slightly altered speaking or thinking the magic word shazam does not cause a transformation if billy does not want it to and can be used to cast magic spells other than the transformation 105 he can share his magical powers and bestow unique powers onto a maximum of six members of his family family in this case extending to chosen and foster relations without weakening himself 141 142 shazam also demonstrates the ability to use magic in numerous ways including conjuring objects casting powerful spells and more 111 143 in 2016 during the darkseid war story arc in the justice league comic book several members of the justice league were infused with the powers of the gods in the wake of darkseid s death shazam became the god of the gods and his powers were temporarily changed to those of six old gods s for the strength of s ivaa the dancer of destruction h for the fires of h ronmeer the martian god of fire art and death a for the compassion of anapel one of the new pantheon z for the source of manipulation of zonus the father of darkseid yuga khan a for the boldness of ate goddess of impulse m for the lightning of mamaragan the wizard other versions edit a significant number of alternate depictions of shazam captain
