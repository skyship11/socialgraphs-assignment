given over to the authorities 10 the harlequin has not been heard from since though roy thomas has stated that she was not killed cooper did make a cameo appearance in alan scott s dream sequence in underworld unleashed abyss hell s sentinel 1 december 1995 some readers have speculated that she may be the mysterious harlequin introduced in green lantern quarterly 5 6 summer and fall 1993 this new harlequin is shown standing next to the golden glider in underworld unleashed 1 november 1995 whom some misinterpreted as being marcie cooper herself another piece of speculation entails marcie cooper having been the marcy from secret origins vol 2 20 november 1987 and batgirl special 1 1988 that last idea was tentatively acknowledged by millennium index 1 1987 unknown edit the mysterious fourth harlequin from green lantern quarterly 5 a mysterious new harlequin debuted in green lantern corps quarterly 5 6 and battled alan scott as a little girl she discovered she had illusion casting powers

illusions of icicle and solomon grundy for alan scott to battle and then revealed herself to him during that encounter scott mysteriously regained his youth though at first he thought this an illusion he later learned that the original consciousness of the starheart had been reawakened and m la had been tortured and slain the mysterious fourth harlequin battles alan scott during her battles with scott she eventually attacked his wife molly mayne scott the first harlequin she created illusions of a decrepit version of molly while she flooded scott s head with visions of them together in space as barbarians as detectives and eventually as medieval warriors scott was able to break free when he unleashed his simmering rage against her and showed her a world where he ruled over hell and she was his captive slave she stopped the battle fled shouting that he had ruined everything and instantly disappeared into the air she returned and made an appearance in alan s dream sequence in underworld unleashed abyss hell s sentinel 1 she also appeared in hell alongside the other villains summoned by neron in underworld unleashed 1 during the underworld unleashed crossover event a character named fay moffit became the third spellbinder she bears a striking resemblance both physically and in terms of powers to this mysterious harlequin although very similar they are two separate characters 11 powers and abilities edit the primary tool of the molly mayne version of the harlequin was her glasses the glasses were later explained as a gift from the manhunters as one of their agents by using the glasses she was able to project realistic three dimensional holograms and fire energy blasts in recent years the glasses enabled an aged molly to maintain the physical vitality of her youth s athleticism her secondary tool is a mandolin with an extending handle which she uses as a defensive weapon especially against the golden age green lantern due to his ring s weakness to its wooden construction the marcie cooper version of the harlequin wears special glasses that allows her to hypnotize people and to create realistic illusions in the minds of the people around her she can even project illusions over television she also wields a mandolin with an extending handle that can be used as a weapon a psychopathic killer she is not afraid to do whatever it takes to destroy her opponents the unidentified harlequin has illusion casting powers similar to her predecessors however her illusions are much more intense and powerful than the illusions cast by molly mayne and marcie cooper which were created from their glasses when casting her illusions if the victim has any doubt that the illusion is not real they will feel the pain that her illusion is inflicting on them other
