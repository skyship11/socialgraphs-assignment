more bat like the character received his own spin off publication batman in 1940 batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice unlike most superheroes batman does not possess any superpowers instead relying on his intellect fighting skills and wealth the 1960s batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in

in early 1939 the success of superman in action comics prompted editors at national comics publications the future dc comics to request more superheroes for its titles in response bob kane created the bat man 6 collaborator bill finger recalled that kane had an idea for a character called batman and he d like me to see the drawings i went over to kane s and he had drawn a character who looked very much like superman with kind of reddish tights i believe with boots no gloves no gauntlets with a small domino mask swinging on a rope he had two stiff wings that were sticking out looking like bat wings and under it was a big sign batman 7 the bat wing like cape was suggested by bob kane inspired as a child by leonardo da vinci s sketch of an ornithopter flying device 8 finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask a cape instead of wings and gloves he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume 9 10 11 12 finger said he devised the name bruce wayne for the character s secret identity bruce wayne s first name came from robert the bruce the scottish patriot wayne being a playboy was a man of gentry i searched for a name that would suggest colonialism i tried adams hancock then i thought of mad anthony wayne 13 he later said his suggestions were influenced by lee falk s popular the phantom a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which kane was also familiar 14 kane and finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the bat man s look personality methods and weaponry details find predecessors in pulp fiction comic strips newspaper headlines and autobiographical details referring to kane himself 15 as an aristocratic hero with a double identity batman had predecessors in the scarlet pimpernel created by baroness emmuska orczy 1903 and zorro created by johnston mcculley 1919 like them batman performed his heroic deeds in secret averted suspicion by playing aloof in public and marked his work with a signature symbol kane noted the influence of the films the mark of zorro 1920 and the bat whispers 1930 in the creation of the character s iconography finger drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like doc savage the shadow dick tracy and sherlock holmes made the character a master sleuth 16 17 in his 1989 autobiography kane detailed finger s contributions to batman s creation one day i called bill and said i have a new character called the bat man and i ve made some crude elementary sketches i d like you to look at he came over and i showed him the drawings at the time i only had a small domino mask like the one robin later wore on batman s face bill said why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious at this point the bat man wore a red union suit the wings trunks and mask were black i thought that red and black would be a good combination bill said that the costume was too bright color it dark grey to make it look more ominous the cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms as bill and i talked we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when bat man was in action and changed them into a cape scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope also he didn t have any gloves on and we added them so that he wouldn t leave fingerprints 14 golden age subsequent creation credit kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for among other compensation a mandatory byline on all batman comics this byline did not originally say batman created by bob kane his name was simply written on the title page of each story the name disappeared from the comic book in the mid 1960s replaced by credits for each story s actual writer and artists in the late 1970s when jerry siegel and joe shuster began receiving a created by credit on the superman titles along with william moulton marston being given the byline for creating wonder woman batman stories began saying created by bob kane in addition to the other credits finger did not receive the same recognition while he had received credit for other dc work since the 1940s he began in the 1960s to receive limited acknowledgment for his batman writing in the letters page of batman 169 february 1965 for example editor julius schwartz names him as the creator of the riddler one of batman s recurring villains however finger s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline kane wrote bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career he felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by 13 at the time of finger s death in 1974 dc had not officially credited finger as batman co creator jerry robinson who also worked with finger and kane on the strip at this time has criticized kane for failing to share the credit he recalled finger resenting his position stating in a 2005 interview with the comics journal bob made him more insecure because while he slaved working on batman he wasn t sharing in any of the glory or the money that bob began to make which is why he was going to leave kane s employ kane should have credited bill as co creator because i know i was there that was one thing i would never forgive bob for was not to take care of bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of batman as with siegel and shuster it should have been the same the same co creator credit in the strip writer and artist 18 although kane initially rebutted finger s claims at having created the character writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that it seemed to me that bill finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the batman t sic as well as robin and all the other leading villains and characters this statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue kane himself also commented on finger s lack of credit the trouble with being a ghost writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without credit however if one wants the credit then one has to cease being a ghost or follower and become a leader or innovator 19 in 1989 kane revisited finger s situation recalling in an interview in those days it was like one artist and he had his name over it the comic strip the policy of dc in the comic books was if you can t write it obtain other writers but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version so bill never asked me for it the byline and i never volunteered i guess my ego at that time and i felt badly really when he finger died 20 in september 2015 dc entertainment revealed that finger would be receiving credit for his role in batman s creation on the 2016 superhero film batman v superman dawn of justice and the second season of gotham after a deal was worked out between the finger family and dc 2 finger received credit as a creator of batman for the first time in a comic in october 2015 with batman and robin eternal 3 and batman arkham knight genesis 3 the updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as batman created by bob kane with bill finger 3 early years batman made his debut in detective comics 27 cover dated may 1939 cover art by bob kane the first batman story the case of the chemical syndicate was published in detective comics 27 cover dated may 1939 finger said batman was originally written in the style of the pulps 21 and this influence was evident with batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals batman proved a hit character and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in detective comics by that time detective comics was the top selling and most influential publisher in the industry batman and the company s other major hero superman were the cornerstones of the company s success 22 the two characters were featured side by side as the stars of world s finest comics which was originally titled world s best comics when it debuted in fall 1940 creators including jerry robinson and dick sprang also worked on the strips during this period over the course of the first few batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of batman evolved kane noted that within six issues he drew the character s jawline more pronounced and lengthened the ears on the costume about a year later he was almost the full figure my mature batman kane said 23 batman s characteristic utility belt was introduced in detective comics 29 july 1939 followed by the boomerang like batarang and the first bat themed vehicle the batplane in 31 september 1939 the character s origin was revealed in 33 november 1939 unfolding in a two page story that establishes the brooding persona of batman a character driven by the death of his parents written by finger it depicts a young bruce wayne witnessing his parents murder at the hands of a mugger days later at their grave the child vows that by the spirits of my parents i will avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals 24 25 26 the early pulp inflected portrayal of batman started to soften in detective comics 38 april 1940 with the introduction of robin batman s junior counterpart 27 robin was introduced based on finger s suggestion because batman needed a watson with whom batman could talk 28 sales nearly doubled despite kane s preference for a solo batman and it sparked a proliferation of kid sidekicks 29 the first issue of the solo spin off series batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies the joker and catwoman but for a pre robin inventory story originally meant for detective comics 38 in which batman shoots some monstrous giants to death 30 31 that story prompted editor whitney ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun 32 by 1942 the writers and artists behind the batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the batman mythos 33 in the years following world war ii dc comics adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy the impact of this editorial approach was evident in batman comics of the postwar period removed from the bleak and menacing world of the strips of the early 1940s batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a bright and colorful environment 34 silver and bronze ages 1950s and early 1960s batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s in the story the mightiest team in the world in superman 76 june 1952 batman teams up with superman for the first time and the pair discover each other s secret identity 35 following the success of this story world s finest comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together instead of the separate batman and superman features that had been running before 36 the team up of the characters was a financial success in an era when those were few and far between 37 this series of stories ran until the book s cancellation in 1986 batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist fredric wertham s book seduction of the innocent in 1954 wertham s thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth wertham criticized batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that batman and robin were portrayed as lovers 38 wertham s criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s eventually leading to the establishment of the comics code authority a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry the tendency towards a sunnier batman in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the comics code 39 scholars have suggested that the characters of batwoman in 1956 and the pre barbara gordon bat girl in 1961 were introduced in part to refute the allegation that batman and robin were gay and the stories took on a campier lighter feel 40 in the late 1950s batman stories gradually became more science fiction oriented an attempt at mimicking the success of other dc characters that had dabbled in the genre 41 new characters such as batwoman the original bat girl ace the bat hound and bat mite were introduced batman s adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens in 1960 batman debuted as a member of the justice league of america in the brave and the bold 28 february 1960 and went on to appear in several justice league comic book series starting later that same year new look batman and camp by 1964 sales of batman titles had fallen drastically bob kane noted that as a result dc was planning to kill batman off altogether 42 in response to this editor julius schwartz was assigned to the batman titles he presided over drastic changes beginning with 1964 s detective comics 327 may 1964 which was cover billed as the new look schwartz introduced changes designed to make batman more contemporary and to return him to more detective oriented stories he brought in artist carmine infantino to help overhaul the character the batmobile was redesigned and batman s costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat insignia the space aliens time travel and characters of the 1950s such as batwoman ace the bat hound and bat mite were retired bruce wayne s butler alfred was killed off though his death was quickly reversed while a new female relative for the wayne family aunt harriet cooper came to live with bruce wayne and dick grayson 43 the debut of the batman television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character the success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry and batman reached a circulation of close to 900 000 copies 44 elements such as the character of batgirl and the show s campy nature were introduced into the comics the series also initiated the return of alfred although both the comics and tv show were successful for a time the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968 in the aftermath the batman comics themselves lost popularity once again as julius schwartz noted when the television show was a success i was asked to be campy and of course when the show faded so did the comic books 45 starting in 1969 writer dennis o neil and artist neal adams made a deliberate effort to distance batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s tv series and to return the character to his roots as a grim avenger of the night 46 o neil said his idea was simply to take it back to where it started i went to the dc library and read some of the early stories i tried to get a sense of what kane and finger were after 47 o neil and adams first collaborated on the story the secret of the waiting graves in detective comics 395 january 1970 few stories were true collaborations between o neil adams schwartz and inker dick giordano and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s nevertheless the influence of their work was tremendous 48 giordano said we went back to a grimmer darker batman and i think that s why these stories did so well 49 while the work of o neil and adams was popular with fans the acclaim did little to improve declining sales the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer steve englehart and penciler marshall rogers in detective comics 471 476 august 1977 april 1978 which went on to influence the 1989 movie batman and be adapted for batman the animated series which debuted in 1992 50 regardless circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s hitting an all time low in 1985 51 modern age the dark knight returns frank miller s limited series the dark knight returns february june 1986 returned the character to his darker roots both in atmosphere and tone the comic book which tells the story of a 55 year old batman coming out of retirement in a possible future reinvigorated interest in the character the dark knight returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium s most noted touchstones 52 the series also sparked a major resurgence in the character s popularity 53 that year dennis o neil took over as editor of the batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of batman following dc s status quo altering 12 issue miniseries crisis on infinite earths o neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before 54 one outcome of this new approach was the year one storyline in batman 404 407 february may 1987 in which frank miller and artist david mazzucchelli redefined the character s origins writer alan moore and artist brian bolland continued this dark trend with 1988 s 48 page one shot issue batman the killing joke in which the joker attempting to drive commissioner gordon insane cripples gordon s daughter barbara and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner physically and psychologically the batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when dc comics created a 900 number for readers to call to vote on whether jason todd the second robin lived or died voters decided in favor of jason s death by a narrow margin of 28 votes see batman a death in the family 55 knightfall the 1993 knightfall story arc introduced a new villain bane who critically injures batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance jean paul valley known as azrael is called upon to wear the batsuit during bruce wayne s convalescence writers doug moench chuck dixon and alan grant worked on the batman titles during knightfall and would also contribute to other batman crossovers throughout the 1990s 1998 s cataclysm storyline served as the precursor to 1999 s no man s land a year long storyline that ran through all the batman related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake ravaged gotham city at the conclusion of no man s land o neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by bob schreck 56 another writer who rose to prominence on the batman comic series was jeph loeb along with longtime collaborator tim sale they wrote two miniseries the long halloween and dark victory that pit an early in his career version of batman against his entire rogues gallery including two face whose origin was re envisioned by loeb while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers holiday and the hangman in 2003 loeb teamed with artist jim lee to work on another mystery arc batman hush for the main batman book the 12 issue story line has batman and catwoman teaming up against batman s entire rogues gallery including an apparently resurrected jason todd while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain hush 57 while the character of hush failed to catch on with readers the arc was a sales success for dc the series became 1 on the diamond comic distributors sales chart for the first time since batman 500 october 1993 and todd s appearance laid the groundwork for writer judd winick s subsequent run as writer on batman with another multi issue arc under the hood which ran from batman 637 650 april 2005 april 2006 21st century all star batman

2006 grant morrison and paul dini were the regular writers of batman and detective comics with morrison reincorporating controversial elements of batman lore most notably of these elements were the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s batman comics which morrison revised as hallucinations batman experienced under the influence of various mind bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training morrison s run climaxed with batman r i p which brought batman up against the villainous black glove organization which sought to drive batman into madness batman r i p segued into final crisis also written by morrison which saw the apparent death of batman at the hands of darkseid in the 2009 miniseries batman battle for the cowl wayne s former protégé dick grayson becomes

characterization bruce wayne bruce wayne redirects here for other uses see bruce wayne disambiguation dc comics concept art of bruce wayne by mikel janín batman s secret identity is bruce wayne a wealthy american industrialist as a child bruce witnessed the murder of his parents dr thomas wayne and martha wayne which ultimately led him to craft the batman persona and seek justice against criminals he resides on the outskirts of gotham city in his personal residence wayne manor wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family s fortune and the profits of wayne enterprises his inherited conglomerate 73 74 he supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit wayne foundation which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite 75 in public he frequently appears in the company of high status women which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess 76 although bruce wayne leads an active romantic life his vigilante activities as batman account for most of his time 77 various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant playboy image of bruce wayne as a facade 78 this is in contrast to the post crisis superman whose clark kent persona is the true identity while the superman persona is the facade 79 80 in batman unmasked a television documentary about the psychology of the character behavioral scientist benjamin karney notes that batman s personality is driven by bruce wayne s inherent humanity that batman for all its benefits and for all of the time bruce wayne devotes to it is ultimately a tool for bruce wayne s efforts to make the world better bruce wayne s principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill bruce wayne believes that our actions define us we fail for a reason and anything is possible 81 writers of batman and superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two interpretations vary depending on the writer the story and the timing grant morrison 82 notes that both heroes believe in the same kind of things despite the day night contrast their heroic roles display morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities bruce wayne and clark kent belong to different social classes bruce has a butler clark has a boss t james musler s book unleashing the superhero in us all explores the extent to which bruce wayne s vast personal wealth is important in his life story and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as batman 83 will brooker notes in his book batman unmasked that the confirmation of the batman s identity lies with the young audience he doesn t have to be bruce wayne he just needs the suit and gadgets the abilities and most importantly the morality the humanity there s just a sense about him they trust him and they re never wrong 84 personality batman s primary character traits can be summarized as wealth physical prowess deductive abilities and obsession 85 the details and tone of batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams dennis o neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes julie schwartz did a batman in batman and detective and murray boltinoff did a batman in the brave and the bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other julie and murray did not want to coordinate their efforts nor were they asked to do so continuity was not important in those days 86 the driving force behind bruce wayne s character is his parents murder and their

own spin on it 123 finger and kane originally conceptualized batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue 121 hence the costume s colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey 121 as well as black and grey in the tim burton s batman and batman returns films batman has been depicted as completely black with a

proportions for example the 1960s television show depicted a batboat bat sub and batcycle among other bat themed vehicles the 1960s television series batman has an arsenal that includes such bat names as the bat computer bat scanner bat radar bat cuffs bat pontoons bat drinking water dispenser bat camera with polarized bat filter bat shark repellent bat spray and bat rope the storyline a death in the family suggests that given batman s grim nature he is unlikely to have adopted the bat prefix on his own in the dark knight returns batman tells carrie kelley that the original robin came up with

into locations and attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means bat signal main article bat signal when batman is needed the gotham city police activate a searchlight with a bat shaped insignia over the lens called the bat signal which shines into the night sky creating a bat symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in gotham the origin of the signal varies

wayne and his wife martha murdered with a gun by a mugger named joe chill batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents this event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in gotham city as batman pearson and uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of robin until recently the fixed and accruing and hence canonized events have been few in number 85 a situation altered by an increased effort by later batman editors such as dennis o neil to ensure consistency and continuity

interpretations further information homosexuality in the batman franchise gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of batman since psychologist fredric wertham asserted in seduction of the innocent in 1954 that batman stories are psychologically homosexual the batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies of the nature of which they may be unconscious 261 andy medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay batman deviance and camp that batman is interesting to gay audiences because he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality 262 professor of film and cultural studies will brooker argues the validity of a queer reading of batman and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within whether the character of bruce wayne himself were explicitly gay or not he also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character 263 in 2005 painter mark chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both batman and robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses 264 prompting dc to threaten legal action 265 creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions writer alan grant has stated the batman i wrote for 13 years isn t gay everybody s batman all the way back to bob kane none of them wrote him as a gay character only joel schumacher might have had an opposing view 266 frank miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he is borderline pathological concluding he d be much healthier if he were gay 267 grant morrison said that gayness is built into batman obviously as a fictional character he s intended to be heterosexual but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay 268 psychological interpretations this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it april 2019 batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time and there have been a number of interpretations into the character s psyche in batman and psychology a dark and stormy knight dr travis langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists carl jung and joseph campbell is present in the batman mythos such that the character represents the shadow archetype this archetype according to langley represents a person s own dark side it is not necessarily an evil one but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself langley argues that bruce wayne confronts his own darkness early in life he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil langley uses the jungian perspective to assert that batman appeals to our own need to face our shadow selves 269 270 langley also taught a class called batman a title he was adamant about i could have called it something like the psychology of nocturnal vigilantism but no i called it batman langley says 271 several psychologists have explored bruce wayne batman s mental health robin s rosenberg evaluated his actions and problems to determine if they reach the level of mental disorders she examined the possibility of several mental health issues including dissociative identity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder and several others she concluded that bruce wayne batman may have a disorder or a combination of disorders but due to his fictional nature a definitive diagnosis will remain unknown 272 273 274 however langley himself states in his book that batman is far too functional and well adjusted due to his training confrontation of his fear early on and other factors to be mentally ill more likely he asserts batman s mental attitude is far more in line with a dedicated olympic athlete see also batman rapist camazotz notes originally stylized as the bat man also referred to as the batman
