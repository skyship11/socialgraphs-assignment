s background and identity are never revealed he is at one point an inmate at larkhill resettlement camp one of many concentration camps where black people jews leftists beatniks homosexuals and muslims are exterminated by norsefire a fascist dictatorship that rules britain while there he is part of a group of prisoners who are subjected to horrific medical experimentation conducted by dr delia surridge lewis prothero is the camp s commandant while father anthony lilliman a paedophile vicar is at the camp to lend spiritual support all prisoners who are part of the experiment die with the sole exception of the man in room five v in roman numerals as a result of the experiments the man develops olympic level physical abilities and an incredibly expanded intellect during that time the man had some level of communication with valerie page a former actress imprisoned for being a lesbian kept in room four who wrote her autobiography on toilet paper and then pushed it through a hole in the wall over time the man is allowed to grow roses violet carsons and raise crops for camp officials the man eventually starts taking surplus ammonia based fertilizer back to his cell where he arranges it in bizarre intricate patterns on the floor he then takes a large amount of grease solvent from the gardens in secret the man uses the fertilizer and solvent to make mustard gas and napalm on a stormy night namely 23 december in the novel or 5 november in the film he detonates his homemade bomb and escapes his cell much of the camp is set ablaze and many of the guards are killed by the mustard gas the camp is evacuated and closed down he adopts the new identity v and dons a guy fawkes mask and costume v spends the next five years planning his revenge on norsefire and building his secret base which he calls the shadow gallery he then kills off most of the over 40 surviving personnel from larkhill making each killing look like an accident the villain edit four years after his escape from larkhill v blows up the palace of westminster on 5 november guy fawkes day in the process he stumbles across evey hammond as she is being accosted by several members of the finger norsefire s secret police and saves her bringing her back to his lair v then kidnaps prothero who is now the voice of fate on the government s propaganda radio and drives him insane by destroying his prized doll collection in a satire of the exterminations that occurred at larkhill v kills now bishop lilliman by forcing him to eat a communion wafer laced with cyanide v then injects surridge the one larkhill official who feels remorse for her actions with a poison that kills her without pain v stages an attack on the government s propaganda broadcasting station strapping himself with explosives and forcing the staff to follow his orders under threat of detonating them v then broadcasts a message to the people telling them to take responsibility for themselves and rise up against their government he systematically kills the head officials of norsefire except eric finch the head of norsefire s police force whom he senses is a decent man v also radicalizes evey by kidnapping and torturing her and leading her to believe she is a prisoner in one of larkhill s camps when she announces that she would rather die than inform on him he reveals the ruse to her while she initially condemns him she eventually comes to understand what he was trying to do and becomes his accomplice v explains to her that he is an anarchist in the strict political sense of the term and essentially believes all governments will eventually turn into oppressive fascist states v s goal is not simply to overthrow the norsefire regime but to destroy the organized state entirely he hopes that from the rubble will emerge a utopian anarchistic society not the land of take what you want but the land of do as you please in the climax of the graphic novel v destroys the government s cctv surveillance buildings eroding its control over british citizens however v is mortally wounded when he is shot by finch and he staggers back to the shadow gallery where he dies in evey s arms evey then puts him in state surrounded by violet carson roses lilies and gelignite in an underground train that stops at a blockage along the tracks right under 10 downing street which v had previously prepared the explosives laden train detonates giving v a viking funeral fulfilling his final request to evey who takes on the mantle of v in other media edit film edit hugo weaving as v in the 2005 film v for vendetta the 2005 film adaptation of the comic book starred hugo weaving as v james purefoy was originally cast as v but was replaced by weaving six weeks into production purefoy stated that he found it hard to act while wearing the mask and that was the reason for his departure although some of purefoy s performance was used in the final film weaving received sole credit the film depicts him as being disfigured as a result of the torture he suffered at larkhill and having near superhuman physical abilities as a result of the biological experiments he was put through he claims to have lost all memory of his past completing his transformation into the everyman he claims to be in the comic several events involving v differ markedly from the comics he sets his first bomb to destroy the old bailey and targets the houses of parliament one year later but he does not blow up the post office or 10 downing street and the bomb he leaves in jordan tower is safely defused with it being unclear if he ever legitimately wanted that bomb to go off or just set it up as an excuse while he transmitted his message also where the comic v was portrayed as a political anarchist who sought the destruction of all governments the movie v focuses his anti government philosophy exclusively on norsefire commenting to evey as he prepares for his final stand that he leaves it up to her if parliament should be destroyed as he recognizes that he does not have a right to shape a world he will not see v is also shown sobbing out of guilt for what he put evey through and admits before his death that he fell in love with her in place of finch norsefire official peter creedy and his men confront v at the end of the film bringing high chancellor adam sutler adam susan in the graphic novel as v has demanded creedy executes sutler but v refuses creedy s command to take off his mask and surrender through a hail of gunfire v stays on his feet long enough to kill creedy and his men a piece of armor plating under his cape stops most of the bullets but v is still mortally wounded he staggers down to the tunnel where evey is waiting and dies in her arms she places his body on the explosive laden train for a viking funeral but finch arrives with the intent of arresting her however he relents and allows evey to start the train having finally decided to turn his back on the tyrannical norsefire regime the two watch along with thousands of spectators dressed as v as the train explodes and destroys the houses of parliament television edit main article pennyworth tv series on 29 july
