the superhero superman he is typically depicted as having been imprisoned in the phantom zone along with zod and ursa among whom he is portrayed as the strong and silent muscle in television the

movies began to write action comics in collaboration with geoff johns after an unidentified kryptonian boy crash lands in metropolis and is taken in by lois lane and clark kent he is followed by three more kryptonians in identical vessels general zod and ursa who claim the boy as theirs as well as non in these comics non is portrayed as being more bulky than in the superman ii movie but maintaining the same personality it was revealed that non was a friend to jor el as well as a member of the kryptonian council while they discovered krypton s instability after leading a separatist movement non was abducted by the science council and lobotomized leading to his current status as a minimally verbal brute although now a highly aggressive and mentally lacking enforcer for zod non has apparently retained a level of his old personality and kindness when dealing with young children in another action comics annual it is explained that after zod and ursa give birth to their son who would later become known as christopher kent non behaved not only docile but caring towards chris during his early childhood 1 after being re imprisoned in the phantom zone by superman and chris zod ursa and non once again returned to the prison unknown to the first two chris took secret refuge in the prison with only non aware of him non continued to behave as a protective caretaker towards chris bringing him food and hiding him from his parents when chris was at last found and tortured by his parents another kryptonian thara ak var arrived to rescue chris non was quick to help them as a final act of his humanity and kindness non is punished for this act and made an aspirant in the kryptonian military under lieutenant asha del nar in a unit designated red shard superman is placed into the military guild named commander of the red shard unit superman finds the other aspirants are forcing non to fight a wild animal as a hazing which he stops since this he has been loyal to kal el when trying to round up some wild thought beasts non sees himself holding a young girl powers and abilities edit while on earth in the superman ii movie non had superhuman strength virtual invulnerability superhuman speed flight marginal heat vision and super breath non stands at 6 6 and is exceptionally muscled which further augments his superhuman strength to a degree in recent comics richard donner has portrayed non s strength as greater than that of general zod and ursa put together due to his greater size and muscle mass possibly outmatching that of superman and other mature kryptonians yet non is neither as intelligent nor as brutal as the other two and thus cannot exert the full measure of his superhuman strength nor can he improvise its use the movie version of non is a birth defect mute although his comic book alter ego kru el spoke whole sentences and appears to also be less intelligent than general zod and ursa as stated by jor el his only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction additionally similar to zod and other kryptonian phantom zone escapees non rarely has enough time beneath the yellow sun of earth to absorb and metabolize enough yellow sunlight to experience the full measure of his abilities as he and the other escapees are typically always defeated and banished back to the zone before any significant length of time passes as such if non was allowed enough time in the sun to fully charge his cells with yellow solar energy he would be significantly more physically powerful and more potent with superhuman strength than any other adult kryptonian possibly even superman like all kryptonians he is vulnerable to kryptonite as well as the light of a red sun he may be vulnerable to magic and mind control as well due to the raw physical nature of his kryptonian virtual invulnerability though this has never been seen an atomic bomb would also cause significant injury to his body and can prove fatal if unrelenting despite his great size and strength he is still insufficient in a battle against the likes of doomsday and his superhuman speed is insufficient compared to speedsters like the flash additionally his relatively low intelligence and apparent lack of cognitive ability puts him at many disadvantages in a battle though he can competently follow issued orders non s accelerated healing factor may be deficient to a degree as his muteness did not improve upon entering the empowering and rejuvenating environment of a yellow sun in other media edit television edit non appears in supergirl portrayed by chris vance as one of the primary antagonists of the first season alongside his wife astra unlike the comics he is an articulate speaker he is also the husband and second in command of astra twin sister of supergirl s mother alura zor el 2 3 as in the comics he led a separatist movement on krypton before being apprehended non was imprisoned with his wife in the phantom zone when krypton was destroyed and he his wife and an army of other aliens managed to escape the phantom zone when kara zor el s pod first crashes into earth astra leads them with the intention of saving earth from humanity but for years they are hunted by the american government s deo while kara zor el known as kara danvers on earth grows up once kara takes on the mantle of supergirl she aids her adoptive sister alex danvers deo agent in hunting the phantom zone escapees non pressures astra to proceed with her plan to save the earth despite her knowing that she must kill her niece kara to succeed after astra is killed at the hands of alex danvers non takes command of the remaining kryptonians and sets out to do her bidding working now with the villainous indigo non decides to proceed with project myriad a kryptonian program that enables mind control of masses and blocks off ideas of hope and saving with supergirl having freed the citizens of national city from the effect non decides to take the project a step further and destroy the craniums of every human on earth however before the two can execute their genocidal plan completely non and indigo face supergirl and her ally martian manhunter as the
