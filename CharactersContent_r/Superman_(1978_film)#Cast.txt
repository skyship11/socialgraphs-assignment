reed plays himself as he meets lois and clark outside the daily planet headquarters production edit development edit ilya salkind had first conceived the idea for a superman film in late 1973 22 in november 1974 after a long difficult process with dc comics the superman film rights were purchased by ilya his father alexander salkind and their partner pierre spengler dc wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for superman and approved the producer s choices of muhammad ali al pacino james caan steve mcqueen clint eastwood and dustin hoffman 19 the filmmakers felt it was best to film superman and superman ii back to back and to make a negative pickup deal with warner bros 17 william goldman was approached to write the screenplay while leigh brackett was considered ilya hired alfred bester who began writing a film treatment alexander felt however that bester was not famous enough so he hired mario puzo to write the screenplay at a 600 000 salary 23 24 francis ford coppola william friedkin richard lester who later directed superman ii and iii peter yates john guillermin ronald neame and sam peckinpah were in negotiations to direct peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with ilya george lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to star wars 15 22 ilya wanted to hire steven spielberg to direct but alexander was skeptical feeling it was best to wait until spielberg s big fish opens jaws was very successful prompting the producers to offer spielberg the position but by then spielberg had already committed to close encounters of the third kind 22 guy hamilton was hired as director while puzo delivered his 500 page script for superman and superman ii in july 1975 17 jax ur appeared as one of general zod s henchmen with clark kent written as a television reporter dustin hoffman who was previously considered for superman turned down lex luthor 19 23 in early 1975 brando signed on as jor el with a salary of 3 7 million and 11 75 of the box office gross profits totaling 19 million he horrified salkind by proposing in their first meeting that jor el appear as a green suitcase or a bagel with brando s voice but donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray jor el himself 22 brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13 part roots style miniseries on native americans in the united states 25 brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in twelve days he also refused to memorize his dialogue so cue cards were compiled across the set fellow oscar winner hackman was cast as lex luthor days later the filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of brando s and hackman s footage because they would be committed to other films immediately 17 22 though the salkinds felt that puzo had written a solid story for the two part film they deemed his scripts too long and so hired robert benton and david newman for rewrite work benton became too busy directing the late show so david s wife leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties 15 george macdonald fraser was later hired to do some work on the script but he says he did little 26 their script was submitted in july 1976 17 and had a camp tone including a cameo appearance by telly savalas as his kojak character the scripts for superman and superman ii were now at over 400 pages combined 12 27 pre production started at cinecittà studios in rome with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented in italy producer ilya salkind remembered we lost about 2 million on flying tests 22 marlon brando found out he could not film in italy because of a warrant out for his arrest a sexual obscenity charge from last tango in paris production moved to england in late 1976 but hamilton could not join because he was a tax exile 27 mark robson was strongly considered and was in talks to direct but after seeing the omen the producers hired richard donner donner had previously been planning damien omen ii when he was hired in january 1977 for 1 million to direct superman and superman ii 28 donner felt it was best to start from scratch they had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me 28 donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in tom mankiewicz to perform a rewrite according to mankiewicz not a word from the puzo script was used 27 it was a well written but still a ridiculous script it was 550 pages i said you can t shoot this screenplay because you ll be shooting for five years donner continued that was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages you know 110 pages is plenty for a script so even for two features that was way too much 29 mankiewicz conceived having each kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter justifying the s on superman s costume 28 the writers guild of america refused to credit mankiewicz for his rewrites so donner gave him a creative consultant credit much to the annoyance of the guild 28 casting of superman edit it was initially decided to first sign an a list actor for superman before richard donner was hired as director robert redford was offered a large sum but felt he was too famous burt reynolds also turned down the role while sylvester stallone was interested but nothing ever came of it paul newman was offered his choice of roles as superman lex luthor or jor el for 4 million turning down all three roles 15 when it was next decided to cast an unknown actor casting director lynn stalmaster first suggested christopher reeve but donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny 17 over 200 unknown actors auditioned for superman 30 olympic champion caitlyn jenner auditioned for the title role 15 patrick wayne was cast but dropped out when his father john wayne was diagnosed with stomach cancer 28 both neil diamond and arnold schwarzenegger lobbied hard for the role but were ignored james caan james brolin lyle waggoner christopher walken nick nolte jon voight and perry king were approached 15 22 kris kristofferson and charles bronson were also considered for the title role 31 warren beatty was offered the role but turned it down 32 james caan said he was offered the part but turned it down i just couldn t wear that suit 33 we found guys with fabulous physique who couldn t act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like superman creative consultant tom mankiewicz remembered the search became so desperate that producer ilya salkind s wife s dentist was screen tested 15 22 stalmaster convinced donner and ilya to have reeve screen test in february 1977 reeve stunned the director and producers but he was told to wear a muscle suit to produce the desired muscular physique reeve refused 18 34 undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by david prowse prowse had wanted to portray superman but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not american prowse also auditioned for non reeve went from 188 pounds 85 kg to 212 pounds 96 kg during pre production and filming 35 reeve earned only 250 000 for both superman and superman ii whilst his veteran co stars received huge sums of money 3 7 million for brando and 2 million for hackman for superman i 36 however reeve felt superman brought me many opportunities rather than closing a door in my face 37 jeff east portrays teenage clark kent east s lines were overdubbed by reeve during post production i was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind east commented it was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay chris did a good job but it caused tension between us we resolved our issues with each other years later 14 east also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train he applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble reeve 14 filming edit principal photography began on march 28 1977 at pinewood studios for krypton scenes budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point since superman was being shot simultaneously with superman ii filming lasted nineteen months until october 1978 filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months but problems arose during production john barry served as production designer while stuart craig and norman reynolds worked as art directors derek meddings and les bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors stuart freeborn was the make up artist while barry david tomblin john glen david lane robert lynn and an uncredited peter duffell and andré de toth 38 directed second unit scenes vic armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and reeve s stunt double his wife wendy leech was kidder s double superman was also the final complete film by cinematographer geoffrey unsworth who died during post production while working on tess for director roman polanski the fortress of solitude was constructed at shepperton studios and at pinewood s 007 stage 39 40 upon viewing the footage of krypton warner bros decided to distribute in not only north america but also in foreign countries due to complications and problems during filming warner bros also supplied 20 million and acquired television rights 24 39 new york city doubled for metropolis while the new york daily news building served as the location for the offices of the daily planet brooklyn heights was also used 41 filming in new york lasted five weeks during the time of the new york city blackout of 1977 production moved to alberta for scenes set in smallville with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of beynon alberta the high school football scenes at barons alberta and the kent farm constructed at blackie alberta 42 43 brief filming also took place in gallup new mexico lake mead and grand central terminal 10 director donner had tensions with the salkinds and spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule creative consultant tom mankiewicz reflected donner never got a budget or a schedule he was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget at one point he said why don t you just schedule the film for the next two days and then i ll be nine months over 39 richard lester who worked with the salkinds on the three musketeers and the four musketeers was then brought in as a temporary co producer to mediate the relationship between donner and the salkinds 22 who by now were refusing to talk to each other 39 with his relationship with spengler donner remarked at one time if i d seen him i would have killed him 24 lester was offered producing credit but refused going uncredited for his work 39 salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that donner could not fulfill his directing duties being there all the time meant he lester could take over salkind admitted donner couldn t make up his mind on stuff 22 on lester donner reflected he d been suing the salkinds for his money on three and four musketeers which he d never gotten he won a lot of his lawsuits but each time he sued the salkinds in one country they d move to another from costa rica to panama to switzerland when i was hired lester told me don t do it don t work for them i was told not to but i did it now i m telling you not to but you ll probably do it and end up telling the next guy lester came in as a go between i didn t trust lester and i told him he said believe me i m only doing it because they re paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit i ll never come onto your set unless you ask me i ll never go to your dailies if i can help you in any way call me 29 it was decided to stop shooting superman ii and focus on finishing superman donner had already completed 75 of the sequel 44 the filmmakers took a risk if superman was a box office bomb they would not finish superman ii the original climax for superman ii had general zod ursa and non destroying the planet with superman time traveling to fix the damage 15 donner commented i decided if superman is a success they re going to do a sequel if it ain t a success a cliffhanger ain t gonna bring them to see superman ii 28 effects edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to

reeve with his traditional suit flies toward the sky with metropolis underneath him actual screen shot for comparison suit has greenish hue for use with blue screen effects superman contains large scale visual effects sequences the golden gate bridge scale model stood 70 feet 20 m long and 20 feet 6 m tall other miniatures included the krypton council dome and the hoover dam slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the hoover dam destruction the fortress of solitude was a combination of a full scale set and matte paintings the car crashes on the golden gate bridge were a mixture of models and stunt drivers on a disused runway young clark kent s long distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground the superman costume was to be a much darker blue but the use of blue screen made it transparent 45 as detailed in the superman the movie dvd special effects documentary the magic behind the cape presented by optical effects supervisor roy field in the end three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects for landings and take offs wire flying riggings were devised and used on location these were suspended from tower cranes whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings some of the wire flying work was quite audacious the penultimate shot where superman flies out of the prison yard for example although stuntmen were used reeve did much of the work himself and was suspended as high as 50 feet 15 m in the air counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement rather than electronic or motorized devices the thin wires used to suspend reeve were typically removed from the film in post production using rotoscope techniques although this wasn t necessary in all shots in certain lighting conditions or when superman is very distant in the frame the wires were more or less imperceptible for stationary shots where superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera blue screen matte techniques were used reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen while a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement the actor himself would remain stationary save for banking his body instead the camera would use a mixture of long zoom ins and zoom outs and dolly in dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame the blue background would then be photochemically removed and reeve s isolated image would be inserted into a matted area of a background plate shot the zoom ins or zoom outs would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate the disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate the occasional presence of black matte lines where the matte area and the matted image in this case superman do not exactly match up and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots where the shot is tracking with superman as he flies such as in the superman and lois metropolis flying sequence front projection was used this involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3m that would reflect light back directly into a combined camera projector the result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection a technique was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses 45 the illusion of movement was created by zooming in on reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede for scenes where superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography 45 this also led to the creation of the zoptic system 46 the highly reflective costumes worn by the kryptonians are made of the same 3m material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during superman flying tests we noticed the material lit up on its own donner explained we tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes designing a front projection effect for each camera there was a little light on each camera and it would project into a mirror bounce out in front of the lens hit the costume and millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera 28 music edit main article superman music superman jerry goldsmith who scored donner s the omen was originally set to compose superman portions of jerry goldsmith s work from planet of the apes were used in superman s teaser trailer he dropped out over scheduling conflicts and john williams was hired williams conducted the london symphony orchestra to record the soundtrack 47 the music was one of the last pieces to come into place williams theme from superman main title was released as a single reaching 81 on the u s billboard hot 100 and 69 cash box 48 williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it 15 kidder was supposed to sing can you read my mind the lyrics to which were written by leslie bricusse but donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover 10 maureen mcgovern eventually recorded the single can you read my mind in 1979 although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack it became a mid chart hit on the billboard hot 100 that year 52 spending three weeks at number five on the u s adult contemporary chart as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding canadian charts it was also a very minor hit on the u s country chart reaching 93 both williams and mcgovern s singles contained theme music from the score the score earned john williams an academy award nomination but he lost to giorgio moroder s score for midnight express 49 the soundtrack was originally released as a 2 lp set in december 1978 and the same recording was issued on cd for the first time in 1987 with the tracks growing up and lex luthor s lair omitted to fit the recording onto one disc a re recording of the score conducted by

you will make my strength your own and see my life through your eyes as your life will be seen through mine the son becomes the father and the father the son this is all i all i can send you kal el jor el superman is divided into three basic sections each having a distinct theme and visual style the first segment set on krypton is meant to be typical of science fiction films but also lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between jor el and kal el the second segment set in smallville is reminiscent of 1950s films and its small town atmosphere is meant to evoke a norman rockwell painting the third and largest segment set mostly in metropolis was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible what donner called verisimilitude relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach 10 in each of the three acts the mythic status of superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero s journey or monomyth as described by joseph campbell each act has a discernible cycle of call and journey the journey is from krypton to earth in the first act from smallville to the fortress of solitude in the second act and then from metropolis to the whole world in the third act 54 many have noted the examples of apparent christian symbolism donner tom mankiewicz and ilya salkind have commented on the use of christian references to discuss the themes of superman 10 15 mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with jor el god and kal el jesus 27 donner is somewhat skeptical of mankiewicz s actions joking i got enough death threats because of that 10 several concepts and items of imagery have been used in biblical comparisons jor el casts out general zod from krypton a parallel to the casting out of satan from heaven 10 the spacecraft that brings kal el to earth is in the form of a star star of bethlehem kal el comes to jonathan and martha kent who are unable to have children martha kent states all these years how we ve prayed and prayed that the good lord would see fit to give us a child which was compared to the virgin mary 10 just as little is known about jesus during his middle years clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do jor el says live as one of them kal el to discover where your strength and power are needed but always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage they can be a great people kal el and they wish to be they only lack the light to show the way for this reason above all their capacity for good i have sent them you my only son 10 the theme resembles the biblical account of god sending his only son jesus to earth in hope for the good of mankind more were seen when donner was able to complete superman ii the richard donner cut featuring the fall resurrection and his battle with evil another vision was that of the creation of adam 10 the christian imagery in the reeve films has provoked comment on the jewish origins of superman rabbi simcha weinstein s book up up and oy vey how jewish history culture and values shaped the comic book superhero says that superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a nebbish saying he s a bumbling nebbish jewish stereotype he s woody allen 55 56 ironically it is also in the reeve films that clark kent s persona has the greatest resemblance to woody allen though his conscious model was cary grant s character in bringing up baby this same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in disguised as clark kent jews comics and the creation of the superhero by danny fingeroth 55 56 in the scene where lois lane interviews superman on the balcony superman replies i never lie salkind felt this was an important point in the film since superman living under his secret identity as clark kent is telling the biggest lie of all time his romance with lois also leads him to contradict jor el s orders to avoid altering human history time traveling to save her from dying superman instead takes the advice of jonathan kent his father on earth 15 release edit superman was originally scheduled to be released in june 1978 the 40th anniversary of action comics 1 which first introduced superman but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months editor stuart baird reflected filming was finished in october 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later big budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months 39 donner for his part wished that he had had another six months i would have perfected a lot of things but at some point you ve gotta turn the picture over 29 warner bros pictures spent 6 7 million on marketing the film 24 superman premiered at the uptown theater in washington d c on december 10 1978 57 failed verification with director richard donner and several cast members in attendance three days later on december 13 it had a european royal charity premiere at the empire leicester square in london in the presence of queen elizabeth ii and prince andrew citation needed reception edit box office edit the film set a new all time u s industry record for business during a pre christmas week with 12 million and set new records for warner bros for their best opening day 2 8 million and three day weekend 7 5 million 58 in the week of december 22 28 it set an all time u s weekly record of 18 5 million 59 it also set a record single day gross for warner bros with a gross of 3 8 million 60 in its third weekend it grossed 13 1 million for the four day holiday weekend setting a record 18 day gross of 43 7 million 61 including re releases it went on to gross 134 5 million in the united states and canada and 166 million internationally totaling 300 5 million worldwide 6 superman was the highest grossing film of 1978 in north america and became the sixth highest grossing film of all time after its theatrical run it was also warner bros s most successful film at the time 39 critical response edit according to rotten tomatoes 95 of 73 critics gave superman a positive review with an average rating of 8 1 10 the website s critical consensus reads superman deftly blends humor and gravitas taking advantage of the perfectly cast reeve to craft a loving nostalgic tribute to an american pop culture icon 62 metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 19 critics indicating universal acclaim 63 the film was widely regarded as one of top 10 films of 1978 64 65 66 superman creators jerry siegel and joe shuster gave a positive reaction 19 shuster was delighted to see superman on the screen i got chills chris reeve has just the right touch of humor he really is superman 12 roger ebert gave the film four out of four stars although describing the krypton scenes as ponderous brando was allegedly paid 3 million for his role or judging by his dialogue 500 000 a cliché ebert wrote that superman is a pure delight a wondrous combination of all the old fashioned things we never really get tired of adventure and romance heroes and villains earthshaking special effects and you know what else wit he praised reeve stating that he sells the role wrong casting here would have sunk everything and concluded that the film works so well because of its wit and its special effects 67 ebert placed the film on his ten best list of 1978 68 he would later go on to place it on his great movies list 69 gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film three stars out of four calling it a delightful mess good performances sloppy editing cheap nonflying special effects funny dialog in sum superman is the kind of picture critics tear apart but still say you ought to see it 70 james harwood of variety called the film a wonderful chuckling preposterously exciting fantasy and further added as both the wholesome man of steel and his bumbling secret identity clark kent reeve is excellent 71 vincent canby of the new york times wrote in a mixed review the superman comic strip has been carefully elaborately sometimes wittily blown up for the big theater screen which though busy often seems sort of empty 72 charles champlin of the los angeles times called the film a big letdown praising reeve as the salvaging strength of the film but referring to the matter of the villain as an essential problem finding that even in a succession of wigs gene hackman is not preposterous funny or dementedly menacing and what he s doing here is not evident 73 gary arnold of the washington post wrote in a positive review despite a lull here and a lapse there this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras christopher reeve a young actor at once handsome and astute enough to rationalize the preposterous fancy of a comic book superhero in the flesh 74 writing in a retrospective review james berardinelli believed there s no doubt that it s a flawed movie but it s one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s it s exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be perhaps most heartening of all however is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of superman ii 75 harry knowles is a longtime fan of the film but was critical of elements that did not represent the superman stories as seen in the comics 76 neal gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy he also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of mario puzo s original script and referred to the first three superman films collectively as simply puffed up tv episodes 77 accolades edit superman was nominated for three academy awards best film editing stuart baird best original score john williams and best sound gordon k mccallum graham v hartstone nicolas le messurier and roy charman 78 and received a special achievement academy award for its visual effects donner publicly expressed disgust that production designer john barry and

material may be challenged and removed february 2020 learn how and when to remove this template message the extended tv version edit while by contract richard donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released the salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters this was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the abc television network prior to the film s release financially the more footage that was restored for television the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in during production of the film alexander and ilya salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to warner bros in exchange for financial help 87 which is why warner bros would have theatrical and home video distribution rights so by 1981 when the television rights reverted to the salkinds the producers had already prepared a 3 hour and 8 minute version that actually had been the first version of the film visually locked down prior to being re edited for theatrical release this extended cut which would be utilized for worldwide television distribution reincorporated some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut networks and stations could then re edit their own version at their discretion this edit is commonly known as the salkind international television cut abc aired the broadcast television debut of superman over two nights in february 1982 with a majority of the unused footage the 182 minute network cut which was slightly cut down for content was repeated in november of that same year this time in its entirety in one evening the remaining two abc broadcasts were presented in its original theatrical version when the tv rights reverted to warner bros in 1985 cbs aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version when the movie entered the syndication 88 market in 1988 following a play out run on pay cable 89 90 tv stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut the stations that showed the extended cut 89 edited the second half to add more advertising time and previously on cutback scenes just as abc had done in 1982 in 1994 following a pay cable reissue and its obligatory run on usa network warner bros television syndicated the full 188 minute international television version most famously on los angeles station kcop the most notable additions unseen on u s television were two additional scenes never seen before in addition to what had been previously reinstated 13 this version also surfaced outside of los angeles for example wjla channel 7 an abc affiliate in washington d c aired the extended cut in july 1994 because its first known airing was on the aforementioned kcop it is also known in fan circles as the kcop version there were various extended tv versions each broadcast in various countries most of these are in pan and scan as they were made in the 1980s when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old tvs until 2017 it was thought the quality of the extended network tv version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in 16mm using the film chain system and a mono sound mix done as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981 stereo was not available in television broadcasts 16 mm television prints were in fact made and mastered on ntsc standard definition video for the initial abc network broadcasts however during an inventory of the warner bros library an ip master of the full 188 minute television version was discovered this eighteen reel master was not marked with an aspect ratio but the print was inspected and as it turned out was in the proper 2 35 1 panavision ratio this was the source of the warner archive collection blu ray release of what would officially be called the superman the movie extended cut issued on october 3 2017 91 the video release was visually restored by wb s imaging department and other than the opening and end credits which are in true stereo the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono tv sound mix this particular release also includes another version discussed below richard donner was critical of this extended cut of the film he called this version of the film terrible saying it was nothing more than an assembly he said he cut the bad material out of the movie and that the producers and warner bros added it back in just to make a buck 92 other editions edit when michael thau and warner home video started working on a film restoration in 2000 only eight minutes of the added footage that had been used in the tv cut could be considered restored into a version that director richard donner called his preferred version of the film thau determined that some of the extra footage could not be added because of poor visual effects thau felt the pace of the film s storyline would be adversely affected and there were timing problems matching footage with john williams musical score etc the cut of the movie shown on kcop was put together to make the movie longer when shown on tv as the television station paid per minute to air the movie the special edition cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making 93 there was a special test screening of the special edition in 2001 in austin texas on march 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year which did not occur 94 in may 2001 warner home video released the special edition on dvd 95 director donner also assisted working slightly over a year on the project the release included making of documentaries directed by thau and eight minutes of restored footage 96 thau explained i worked on ladyhawke and that s how i really met dick donner and tom mankiewicz i used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that tom and dick and stuart would tell about superman and that s how i kind of got the ideas for the plots of taking flight and making superman 96 donner commented there are a few shots where chris reeve s costume looked green we went in and cleaned that up bringing the color back to where it should be 97 thau wanted to make the film shorter i wanted to take out the damn poem where lois is reciting a poem can you read my mind when they re flying around i also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action it was like a two minute car chase but dick didn t want to take that out or the poem 96 it was followed by a box set release in the same month containing bare bones editions of superman ii superman iii and superman iv the quest for peace 98 in november 2006 a four disc special edition was released 99 followed by an hd dvd release 100 and blu ray 101 also available with other films is the nine disc christopher reeve superman collection 102 and the 14 disc superman ultimate collector s edition 103 on november 6 2018 following year long worldwide revival theatrical screenings to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film s original release warner bros home entertainment released an ultra hd blu ray of superman presented in a new dolby vision transfer of the original theatrical version straight from the original camera negative with its original 70mm six track stereo mix rendered in 5 1 surround in addition to the 2000 remix in dolby atmos this new release also includes a standard blu ray of the theatrical cut plus select bonus features carried over from previous video releases and digital copies of both the theatrical and three hour tv versions legacy edit in 2007 the visual effects society listed superman as the 44th most influential use of visual effects of all time 104 in 2008 empire magazine named it the 174th greatest film of all time on its list of 500 105 in 2009 entertainment weekly ranked superman 3rd on their list of the all time coolest heroes in pop culture 106 with the film s success it was immediately decided to finish superman ii ilya and alexander salkind and pierre spengler did not ask donner to return because donner had criticized them during the film s publicity phase 15 donner commented in january 1979 i d work with spengler again but only on my terms as long as he has nothing to say as the producer and is just liaison between alexander salkind and his money that s fine if they don t want it on those terms then they need to go out and find another director it sure as shit ain t gonna be me 29 kidder who portrayed lois lane was dissatisfied by the producers decision 39 and also criticized the salkinds during publicity kidder said that as a result she was only given a cameo appearance for superman iii and not a main supporting role 107 jack o halloran who portrayed non stated it was great to work with donner richard lester was as big an asshole as the salkinds 108 two more films superman iii 1983 and superman iv the quest for peace 1987 were produced donner s vision for superman ii was eventually realized nearly three decades later when he supervised the editing of superman ii the richard donner cut which was released in 2006 40 in the same year donner and writer geoff johns wrote last son a comic book story arc in action comics featuring superman 109 unused footage of marlon brando as jor el discovered during the restoration of superman ii the richard donner cut was used in superman returns 2006 40 because superman went into production prior to the releases of star wars may 1977 and close encounters of the third kind november 1977 some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films in the 1980s this is certainly the view of superman producer ilya salkind and some who have interviewed him 15 22 as well as of film production assistant brad lohan 110 other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the lucas and spielberg productions and see superman as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two 111 ilya salkind denies any connection between superman which began filming in march 1977 and the other films stating that i did not know about star wars star wars did not know about superman close encounters did not know about superman it really was completely independent nobody knew anything about anybody 22 superman also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low budget saturday matinee serials director christopher nolan cited richard donner s vision and scope of superman when pitching the concept for batman begins to warner bros in 2002 112 in 2021 dc comics revived the continuity of the 1978 film with their superman 78 comic book series emulating the look of the christopher reeve films the series picks up where the first two films left off thereby acting as a direct sequel 113 the film inspired the kinks 1979 song wish i could fly like superman when the band s main songwriter ray davies watched the film in late 1978 114 the film is recognized by american film institute in these
