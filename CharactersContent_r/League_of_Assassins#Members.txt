assassins edit yasser split from the ancient order of the assassins in a successor movement their followers claim to have annulled and deposed centers of civilizations such as baghdad moscow and rome throughout past generations in their lineage 2 practices edit the recruits of the league of assassins follow a strict regimen carrying distinct black emblems and supplies up to their mountain lairs these new recruits are called ghuls because they emerge after proclaiming their final prayers in their own prefabricated graves before initiating in various assigned operations operations edit unlike the ancient order of the assassins whose main objective was to halt sectarian conflicts and wars within the world the league of assassins acts as an organization that is a catalyst to the reformation of decadent civilizations around the globe fictional team history edit under ebeneezer darhk s leadership edit the league of assassins was founded by ra s al ghul at 1013 a d to be the fang that protects the head batgirl 67 2005 members of the league demonstrated willingness to die at a word from ra s they have included some of the most dangerous assassins in the world including lady shiva david cain and merlyn for much of its current history any member who failed in an assassination was in turn targeted by the league indeed one of its best known members the master archer merlyn was eventually forced to flee from the league fearing for his life having failed to assassinate batman in more recent years this policy has apparently relaxed somewhat ebeneezer darcel aka doctor darhk was the first known individual assigned to head the league of assassins by ra s al ghul darhk himself was seconded by the sensei a martial arts master from hong kong although many of the league s leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists darhk himself did not depend on physical prowess and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation ambushes and death traps as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons although the league apparently had an inner circle of elite fighters as well as a large number of warriors trained in the martial arts the league during darhk s tenure as leader reflected his personal methodology following a falling out with ra s the exact details of which were never made clear darhk kidnapped ra s daughter talia al ghul batman became involved in this matter while attempting to bring the league to justice for a number of recent killings although he had connected the league to several assassinations over the years all previous attempts to investigate had met dead ends batman rescued talia the first time the two would meet laying the foundation for all their future interaction and darhk died while trying to kill them under sensei s leadership edit under the direction of the organization s second known leader the villainous sensei the league became more brutal and it rebelled against ra s rule although the sensei s methods closely resembled darhk s and the majority of the league s operatives showed little to no real skill in personal combat the sensei did show slightly more reliance on skilled martial artists this version of the league is best known for two assassinations as part of an initiation process the operative known as the hook was assigned to murder boston brand who became deadman after his death additionally professor ojo successfully brainwashed ben turner best friend and partner of richard dragon creating an alternate personality dubbed the bronze tiger and turning the master martial artist into a league operative as the bronze tiger turner defeated batman in personal combat while another league operative murdered kathy kane the secret identity of batwoman in pre crisis continuity and a close personal friend of batman s post crisis eventually turner s earlier training at the hands of o sensei not to be confused with the leader of the league proved too strong for the league to fully break and when he refused to kill batman he was forced to flee the league not long afterwards the insane sensei no longer motivated by anything but a desire to raise assassination to an art attempted to cause an artificial earthquake in order to kill a number of diplomats gathered for peace talks batman traced ben turner to a hospital foiling a league attempt to assassinate the man turner could not fully remember the actions of his alternate personality although years later as a member of the suicide squad he would reveal that the league had used him to kill a number of people but he was able to aid batman in uncovering the sensei s latest plot although batman was unable to prevent the earthquake ultimately it was only the sensei himself that died in the disaster and control of the league returned to ra s role in the creation of lady shiva edit it was more recently revealed that prior to the betrayals of doctor daark and the sensei ra s had grown tired of the fickle loyalties of his warriors ra s assigned david cain to create a perfect bodyguard the one who is all after early attempts to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother to this end he assassinated carolyn woosan wu san one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters he had seen fighting in an exhibition carolyn s sister sandra swore revenge and tracked cain down only to be subdued by the combined might of the league both intoxicated and frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer holding back for her sister s sake sandra agreed to be the mother of cain s child in return the league spared sandra s life and assisted her in further training by the time sandra gave birth she had surpassed the entire league in skill she left immediately following the birth of her daughter cassandra cain rechristening herself lady shiva other stories would suggest that at some points afterwards shiva worked as a member of the league and eyewitness testimony from former league member onyx indicates that she kept in contact with the league although she apparently did not see her daughter although most of her appearances over the years show her working independently she apparently had some degree of league membership and was called upon by ra s to rescue talia during the hush storyline in keeping with ra s and cain s plans the league attempted to train cassandra cain from birth to be the ultimate assassin unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero batgirl under nyssa al ghul s leadership edit after the death of ra s al ghul his first born daughter nyssa raatko formed a new league lady shiva was recruited to serve as the sensei to this incarnation of the league with the intent that batgirl cassandra cain would lead the warriors themselves reflecting shiva s emphasis for martial arts the known members of nyssa s league were all skilled in this area and included the warriors shrike kitty kumbata wam wam joey n bobo tigris momotado krunk white willow the twin warriors los gemelos ox mad dog alpha and cristos the new league was present when mr freeze s wife nora fries was brought back to life as the monstrous lazara and several members died in the resulting chaos due to the conflict between their loyalty to shiva and nyssa and their near worship of batgirl as the one who is all the league split at that point with ox white willow and tigris pledging themselves to cassandra several more members of the league including all the defectors except tigris died when the insane mad dog went on a killing spree the mad dog it was revealed had been one of david cain s early attempts to create ra s perfect warrior the mad dog had been considered useless as a child since cain s methods had driven him murderously insane and ra s had ordered the child be killed nyssa however knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild explaining how it was possible to recruit him the mad dog was successful in killing batgirl who gave her life to protect the burqa clad assassin tigris she was quickly restored to life in a lazarus pit by shiva in order that the two could face each other in a final battle batgirl won leaving shiva on a meat hook suspended over the lazarus pit infinite crisis edit although most of its members had died or defected the league survived the infinite crisis and was seen to play an important role in the society s worldwide prison break throughout the period of aftermath it remained under the control of nyssa until she was apparently killed in a car explosion cassandra cain has apparently taken over the league as its new leader although she abandoned the league at some point prior to the teen titans storyline titans east where it is revealed that she was being drugged by deathstroke furthermore it appears that cassandra was battling for complete control of the league of assassins with ra s al ghul s youngest daughter talia as well as the sensei talia who would naturally assume control of her father s empire by default following nyssa s death has recently been seen in the batman and son storyline leading ninja members of the league of assassins against batman at the same time several members felt neither talia nor cassandra were up to the role and after failing to recruit black canary s adopted daughter sin gave the leadership to the sensei who recently reappeared in the resurrection of ra s al ghul storyline one year later talia al ghul forced kirk langstrom to give her the man bat formula which she used to turn some of its members into man bats currently the league of assassins and its man bat commandos are used by talia as her personal army and bodyguards carrying her orders and taking retribution over her enemies 3 in the series green arrow black canary 11 a metahuman faction of the league of assassins was introduced they were involved in the abduction of an injured connor hawke this group s members included bear tolliver ruck spike mazone and their leader targa however although they thought they were being commanded by ra s al ghul they were apparently duped by an imposter shado 4 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe the league of assassins reside in the sacred city of eth alth eban lady shiva rictus cheshire december graystone and bronze tiger target red hood they end up capturing jason todd and bring him to eth alth eban so that he can help lead the league of assassins 5 red hood has been led to eth alth eban where the league of assassins resides bronze tiger explains that costumed heroes have been fighting to maintain a broken system a system that can only be fixed by taking the next step and culling the weak and wicked from the world he and the others have chosen jason to be their leader in taking the action that the world s super heroes have been too afraid to take red hood admits that he abandoned his friends because he did not want to be a killer in response bronze tiger begs the opportunity to show red hood how to do real lasting good the assassins give jason a tour of the death market where tools of death and murder can be bought to fill any need provided that the need in question is killing a lot of people after reuniting with december graystone cheshire lady shiva and rictus bronze tiger calls a meeting of the council to which red hood is invited meanwhile they are concerned about the security of the city given the coming war rictus assures them that it would take approximately four hundred terawatts of power to break through the city s walls at their meeting red hood wonders what it is about him that makes them think he can lead them to victory against the untitled bronze tiger admits amid jeers from his companions that he was told by talia al ghul that red hood would be the only one who could stop the untitled if they ever attacked this comes as a surprise to red hood given that he cannot even remember what the untitled look like bronze tiger reminds that if jason wants to do good with his life he cannot do much better than to fight against the most powerful force for evil on the planet just then sensors reveal that something is on the perimeter of the city it is arsenal and he is heavily armed 6 arsenal is using all of his unique inventions to hold back the defensive attacks of the man bat commandos of the league of assassins the first assassin arsenal encounters is december graystone and he soon entraps the magician within a block of ice thanks to some grenades made with technology he stole from mr freeze next cheshire appears next to him thanks to her teleportation abilities and steals the hat off of his head however he spots the teleportation device implanted in her wrist and uses an electrical shock to short it out that causes the device to malfunction and she disappears completely during the fight red hood states that he would lead the league of assassins in exchange that arsenal and starfire are unharmed starfire reminds jason that she would rather die than be put in chains again she warns him that with the last lazarus pit uncovered it can strip away the untitled s powers which is why they have come to destroy it they must not succeed as she and arsenal are escorted away she warns jason not to die today as he prepares himself red hood begins to hear a voice from within that explains that his destiny is coming to fruition and shows him how to make the mystical all blades manifest in his hands though he does not remember what all this means he hopes it will help as the untitled arrive in the sacred city 7 outside the sacred city of eth alth eban december graystone discovers someone he was not expecting to see waiting outside and curses himself for not realizing that this person had something to do with the battle currently underway in the subterranean city red hood is currently leading the league of assassins in a charge against the evil untitled who had the gall to use jason s friend arsenal against him to get into the city jason is confused when his swords tell him that by taking bronze shards from the great fountain at the centre of the city they will be able to drive off the untitled but he hopefully passes on the information to his companions red hood finds himself locked in combat with drakar and the man discovers that what was done to red hood s mind was more than a simple mind wipe he senses ducra somewhere within his mind red hood uses drakar s confusion to steer him toward the fountain which hides the well of sins the pool that filled the untitled with evil drakar struggles but collapses into the murky fluid having fallen into the well of sins drakar begs to be removed from it as he can feel the arcane power reaching back inside him and taking the evil energy within him away the pool strips drakar of his power and life force spitting him back out as a withered old man turning to the remaining untitled red hood warns that they will all suffer the same fate if they do not surrender the untitled respond that he cannot hope to defeat them alone but lady shiva responds by unleashing a swarm of man bats warning that the league of assassins is death incarnate when the untitled have been cast back into the well of sins by the league of assassins drakar plans to take red hood with him only for bronze tiger to snap drakar s neck following drakar s death red hood admits that killing drakar was necessary a key realization for a member of the league of assassins lady shiva comments that tonight they will see all the remaining untitled dead as well but jason responds that they cannot simply kill without his say so if he is to be the league s leader suddenly a cloaked figure appears noting that he expected more after coming all this way just to find a leader of assassins who orders his warriors to sheathe their blades the man warns that the game is over and jason s part in it is done as he makes his way toward the well of sins jason stands in his way demanding to know who this man is the man responds that he is the one who gave the untitled the location of the acres of all knowing that they would kill ducra and return to this place he knew they would fall here and imbue the well of sins with a greater power than he had ever tasted a power that he would now take for himself having planned this moment for three centuries emerging from the pit the man introduces himself as ra s al ghul 8 jason is under attack by ra s al ghul who demands to know just what his daughter talia al ghul saw in the boy having just emerged from the well of sins ra s al ghul is consumed by the evil that once corrupted the untitled centuries ago now he feels compelled to rid himself of the machinations of his daughter and ducra by killing jason at ra s al ghul s command the prisoners are brought to him and he promises to use his newfound power to see them dead red hood however determines that he cannot allow it to happen as ra s al ghul gathers his power red hood tells himself again and again that he wants to remember what he chose to forget at last the images rush through his mind and begin to reform as memories unfortunately the revelation occurs earlier than ducra had planned having regained all of his training with batman as well jason is free of his chains almost instantly his training with lady shiva sees him making short work of the league s man bats he uses that same training to best lady shiva herself only to be attacked by bronze tiger next in the meantime though cheshire whose loyalty to the league of assassin s returned master is waning attempts to rescue roy and kori before long the pair are free to aid red hood in his fight smirking he welcomes them back apologizing for his having deceived them they are confused unaware that his decision to erase his memory was part of a grander plan 9 red hood engages ra s al ghul as essence joins the battle she insists that he will allow jason and his friends to leave his realm or he will be forced to die a mortal death just as he always feared he would despite having destroyed the all caste ra s actions have led to their eventual rebirth defeated he swears that he will visit great agony upon red hood if he sees him ever again 10 talia al ghul s own organization leviathan is a schism of the league of assassins created to counter batman s batman incorporated 11 batman and aquaman head to an island where the league of assassins are after ra s al ghul had the bodies of damian wayne and talia al ghul exhumed batman and aquaman storm the beach breaking through the island s defences of man bats only to find that the source of the whales screaming was on the island ra s al ghul had ordered the hunt of whales creating genetically altered super humans in the wombs of sperm whales this being just one of a probable many plans to rebuild the league of assassins aquaman swears vengeance on the whales behalves inside the compound they find that ra s is wiping the hard drives clean preventing data recovery even as a message from ra s plays over the intercom chastising batman for failing to prevent the deaths of damian or talia within the city he swore to protect as his parting gift he has left batman the heretics to keep him entertained batman reels as he sees all of the grotesque and mutated failed clones of failed damians as they fight for their lives batman warns aquaman not to kill any of these monstrosities they are too developmentally malformed to comprehend what they had done to those whales in being born suddenly bruce realizes that if the heretics were born of a whale s womb arthur might be able to telepathically link up with them he leads them out into the ocean where an unharmed whale breaches and swallows them whole batman meanwhile fights his way to ra s escape aircraft he sees talia and damian s bodies stored within it and clings to the fuselage from outside as the plane takes off though ra s al ghul plans to go to paradise island he is nearly surprised to see batman pounding on the cockpit s windshield from outside batman screams for ra s al ghul to give back his son but ra s al ghul responds that he is blood of damian s blood and the boy is in good hands he orders the plane to tilt its angle causing the wind shear to rip batman from his purchase and drop down into the sea luckily aquaman is there to catch him arthur explains that all of the heretics are alive having been taken down by a whale to atlantis for safe keeping 12 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics

control of count vertigo it subsequently appears under ra s al ghul s control in the demon s quest pt 1 and pt 2 showdown and avatar the society of shadows was founded by ra s al ghul dating back to the 1800s and quite possibly even further than that the purpose of the organization was to accomplish ra s life goal of restoring the earth to a pure and untainted world and undo all the pollution and damage done to it by humanity even if that meant destroying most if not all of humanity to reach that goal the organization was vast and powerful having branches and influence all over the world it consisted of various types of people who were fiercely loyal to ra s including highly trained assassins spies scientists and soldiers it also had vast resources and seemingly a large system of intelligence this is due to the fact that ra s was able to determine batman s true identity partly because his organization easily determined which wealthy americans regularly amassed the kind of technology and equipment that someone like batman would require the society of shadows re appears in the superman the animated series episode the demon reborn talia al ghul and her henchmen
