fictional character biography edit earth two edit originally on earth two just called ghost this criminal clashed twice with hawkman and hawkgirl claiming to be an actual ghost hawkman refused to believe it and the couple s investigation seemed to support that but the original story left the truth ambiguous in their next encounter it was confirmed that the supposed ghost was a mundane criminal named james craddock who had used special tricks and gadgets to pretend to be a ghost 3 4 post crisis edit in post crisis continuity james craddock is the son of an english gentleman who abandoned both jim and his mother forcing them into poverty craddock grew up to become a notorious highwayman and robber who terrorized england in the 19th century under the name gentleman jim after a prophecy from a gypsy said he would be a highwayman he encountered the ghosts of other highwaymen and dick turpin left him a horse he journeyed to the united states and encounters the gunslingers nighthawk and cinnamon the hot headed nighthawk lynched craddock after wrongly assuming that he sexually assaulted cinnamon but craddock somehow eludes death to rise again as a ghost 5 the gentleman ghost learns he must wander the earth until the spirit of his killer moves on to the next plane of existence 6 nighthawk and cinnamon turn out to be the reincarnations of ancient egyptian royalty prince khufu and chay ara their souls due to their exposure to the thanagarian nth metal can never truly pass on both are eventually resurrected as hawkman and hawkgirl and the gentleman ghost becomes their recurring nemesis during the 1940s 7 craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes including batman the atom flash the new teen titans max mercury and stargirl but the vengeful ghost always returns to his main foes the hawks sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend gentleman ghost later appears as a member of the injustice society 8 during the infinite crisis storyline he joins alexander luthor jr s secret society of super villains he fought alan scott and placed him in a coma 9 his origin is explored and altered in the pages of jsa 82 87 2006 the natural son of an abusive father and a poor mother young jim craddock soon slips into a life of crime making contacts with the supernatural after a gypsy prophesies that he will be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on english soil his villainous career is put to an end when he is captured and sentenced to death by hanging after he is tricked by a woman he is trying to seduce who summons redcoats returning as a ghost he battles those on jsa hoping for the prophecy to come true when the rightful time arrives the ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies the jsa past like someone scott killed with an electrical accident although this is a fake and other highwaymen his plan is foiled by stargirl who as a virgin girl is impervious to ghostly attacks an army of ghostly nobles who attack his army and wildcat surprisingly a descendant of the royal house of england who decapitates him vanquished he disappears 10 gentleman ghost is seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the get out of hell free card from the secret six the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe gentleman ghost is still a thief and is not a ghost like his earth two counterpart 11 in his first appearance he steals the mortis orb which has the power to resurrect the dead 12 hawkman deduces that gentleman ghost is jim craddock and gentleman ghost confirms it gentleman ghost tells hawkman he invited him here because the nth metal drew him to the mortis orb then he tells hawkman he will take him to the orb but hawkman refuses so gentleman ghost sends more apparitions after him hawkman escapes the building then gentleman ghost appears again saying that the warlock s spell rendered the orb inert years ago but the nth metal broke the spell causing the orb to regain its power gentleman ghost takes the orb saying that he will use it to transcend death and resurrect himself through the life force of every man woman and child nearby then he disappears and the zombies attacking hawkman fall apart 13 gentleman ghost begins fully harnessing the orb s power creating a portal from which julius gates comes out gates demanding the orb grabs craddock while hawkman takes the orb from him the portal vanishes with craddock and gates inside causing them both to disappear along with the apparitions and zombies hawkman drops the mortis orb somewhere in antarctica to keep it from falling into the wrong hands again 14 sometime later craddock takes up residence in a new hampshire called duskhaven which he operates out of while he robs wealthy socialites of gotham when the midnight shift apprehends him he reveals his new origins some time in the past craddock was a philanderer and drew the ire of a witch who cursed him granting his abilities but forcing him to commit criminal acts he believed the curse would be lifted once the witch died it was not and he found himself to be immortal 11 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 when sebastian faust goes rogue and steals all the magical items in a r g u s storage amanda waller recruits craddock into a special magic based team of criminals known as suicide squad black 15 powers and abilities edit the gentleman ghost of earth two seemed to rely on devices to simulate a ghostly existence the original 1940s stories left the question of his nature open to speculation later he is retconned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit as a ghost craddock has several abilities he can become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material he can become completely invisible in fact the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible he has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states gentleman ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots spectral fire and flintlock pistols when passing through craddock s ghostly form people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold since this does not happen every time it would seem that he can control this effect craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the wizard to johnny sorrow on certain occasions most of the manifestations of his abilities like teleportation and phasing are accompanied by a purple glow of spectral energy or transparent mist possibly courtesy of different pencilers around the time of his prophesied return to life he gains the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother s spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son it is unknown if he can still call upon them the gentleman ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins this is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both stargirl and jakeem thunder however he can pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them as when he brandished the cosmic rod as a supernatural being gentleman ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt but those with royal blood can physically harm him and when unaware energy hitting him causes pain other versions edit kingdom come edit in the kingdom come
