comics published by dc comics the original hourman was created by writer ken fitch and artist bernard baily in adventure comics 48 march 1940 during the golden age of comic books 1 the first hourman is chemist rex tyler who creates a new synthesis miraclo which grants him super strength and endurance but only for one hour 2 rex tyler made his live action debut in the season one finale of the cw

edit rex tyler edit main article hourman rex tyler the original hourman is rex tyler who appeared in the golden age of comic books and is a common member of the justice society of america 3 rick tyler edit main article hourman rick tyler rick tyler rex s son took over the hourman mantle during the crisis on infinite earths rick swallowed some of his father s miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital after serving for a few years as a member of infinity inc a team composed largely of other jsa member children rick began to grow addicted to miraclo just as his father did he spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until amazo posing as a future incarnation of the android hourman cured him of his miraclo addiction having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health rick joined the jsa in its incarnation as a small band of freedom fighters during the stealing thunder arc the android had given him an hourglass full of tachyons that gave rick random visions one hour into the future as a second gift rick could visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the timepoint frozen in time just before rex s death at one point rick is severely injured in battle and switched places with his father to save his life tyler the android known as the third hourman took rex and some other jsa members to the timepoint to save rick s life the one hour rex was allotted in the timepoint expired just as doctor mid nite and tyler had healed rick of his injuries father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with extant ultimately tyler the android took rex s place and was destroyed when rick and rex returned to earth rick is once again active as hourman and is an active member of the jsa he is married to jesse chambers matthew tyler edit main article hourman android in the 853rd century another hourman an android that was modeled on rex tyler s dna served with both the justice league and the justice society for a time he often perceived himself as rex and also as rex s descendant originally possessing the time manipulating cosmic artifact known as the worlogog he divested himself of most of its power at the suggestion of snapper carr and went about learning to be human after failing to stop extant from escaping a fight hourman quit the jsa and began travelling through the timestream returning when he received a distress call from the jsa as noted above he is believed to have been destroyed at the hands of extant in rex s place although the time traveler rip hunter mentioned that his actions would leave him inactive for a relative year indicating his probable return before he died the android also gave his hourglass to rex tyler who hopes to rebuild him the android briefly used the alias matthew tyler and was often simply called tyler powers and abilities edit neither rex nor rick have any innate powers though it was once theorized that their powers derive from a metagene like many dc superheroes any superhuman abilities they display are derived from the use of miraclo taking miraclo grants a user several abilities for the span of an hour most obvious are the superhuman strength durability increased resistance to physical damage to the extent of being impervious to small arms fire and speed enhancements other lesser known and mentioned powers include night vision and the ability to survive underwater rex and rick both took miraclo in pill form but rick later changed to using a transdermal patch the amount of miraclo that can be taken per day has varied normally it is once a day but in some instances rex has been shown taking another pill as soon as an hour of power runs out one story states that rex needed to wait another hour after the miraclo wore off before taking another dose miraclo works specifically on the tylers and may or may not work on others who take it in one instance it worked on an animal dr mid nite s owl hootie as well as the villain bane rex and rick both wore an hourglass around their necks given to them by the hourman android it was filled with energized tachyons time in its most basic form it gives rick time vision flashes of events that will happen exactly one hour later as well as the ability to touch those out of phase with normal time the latter effect comes to anyone holding the hourglass rex displayed neither of these abilities tyler is often simply called an android but is actually an intelligent machine colony possibly a form of nanotechnology created by tylerco in the far future if damaged this colony can effortlessly multiply and repair his software is encoded with the genetics of rex tyler giving him all of rex s memories he originally possessed the worlogog which gave him complete control over time he later gave all but a shard of it up but not before he absorbed all of batman s memories of the jla though not as powerful as he was originally tyler still retained super strength durability and speed equivalent to a person using miraclo he was able to access an hour of power sixty minutes during which he had power over time he can do many things with this control move between picoseconds travel through time use his own time vision which allows him to see a person s past and future as well as their age or make people and things younger slow a person down until essentially frozen create tunnels between different time periods and share power with other individuals though the amount of time that he provides them power for directly takes away from his sixty minutes tyler activates the hour of power at will and the hourglass on his chest keeps count of the time there seems to be some doubt how often he can use his hour of power like the other hourmans use of miraclo sometimes tyler is said to only have one hour of power a day while at other times he simply must wait another hour to recharge before he can reactivate and it is unclear if he must use that hour of power in one go or if he can spread it out over the course of the day tyler also has a timeship that he can summon from the timestream it is connected to him and reacts to his thoughts it normally appears as a viking style wooden sailing ship adorned with clocks but it can change form as tyler dictates to anything from a simple wooden skiff to a futuristic spaceship and also be used as a weapon as when hourman made a large hand out of it to trap extant the ship can travel through time to alternate timelines or through hypertime in other media edit see also hourman rex tyler in other media and hourman rick
