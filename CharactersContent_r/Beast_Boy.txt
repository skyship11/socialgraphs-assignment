powers of many of earth s metahuman population to become erratic in beast boy s case he occasionally transforms into a monstrous hulking version of himself often going on rampages until he can regain his senses wanting to assist other metahumans affected by the source wall like himself he joins nightwing s new incarnation of the titan s joining with raven miss martian donna troy and steel following a confrontation between the titans and mother blood beast boy gains control over his new transformation 31 powers and abilities edit beast boy has the ability to morph and transform into any animal that he has seen himself or has seen in an illustration as is the case when he shapeshifts into an animal such as an extinct dinosaur 6 7 these transformations take only 1 second and beast boy has demonstrated that he is capable of rapidly changing his form with little or no effort expended as a corollary to this power he can transform back into his default form if an external force like magic transforms him into an animal his power enables him to completely alter his body mass being able to take the shape of animals far larger and heavier than himself such as an elephant a hippopotamus or a tyrannosaurus rex though until recent stories such larger forms would physically exhaust him or smaller and lighter animals such as mice arachnids and insects as a result of his rapidly changing genetic structure and mass beast boy has an increased healing factor comparable to that of the creeper and deathstroke allowing him to heal from bullet wounds burns and broken bones in a matter of seconds and in some story lines regrow entire limbs he cannot change or return to a form if the space he occupies is too small and he cannot normally break through confines as seen when he attempts to transform into a tyrannosaurus rex underneath a bridge and hits his head instantly aborting the transformation his power also enables him to radically alter his body structure and take forms of animals without limbs like snakes or those without skeletons like a jellyfish in two notable instances he has even taken the form of multiple individuals simultaneously once as a swarm of fireflies and again as a mass of barnacles in another comic he was seen to take on the form of what appeared to be a green version of beast from x men beast boy s transformations have not been limited to earth life forms when on a rescue mission in the vegan system to free starfire he easily transformed into a gordanian one of the green skinned alien warriors native to the system in order to sneak robin and cyborg onto a warship in the who is wonder girl story arc he was able to infiltrate another alien world after being shown a green skinned creature native to the planet he had some difficulty with this change claiming that earth animal forms he knew instinctively but was successful in the transformation when he pursued madame rouge in revenge for her role in killing his foster mother rita farr he began transforming into creatures that do not even exist products of his subconscious rage against the villainess while an animal he gains all of the physical abilities attributes and characteristics of said animal such as greatly enhanced superhuman strength a gorilla superhuman speed a cheetah and enhanced durability a turtle and abilities such as flight various birds and aquatic breathing various fish he can even gain the specific poisons and toxins produced by specific snakes he also gains the ability to survive or otherwise live in the same hostile environments some animals can as seen in one comic where he morphs into a parasitic worm to become resistant to the stomach acid and immune system of brother blood when he dived into the villain s intestinal tract to retrieve raven s chakra while in animal form beast boy retains his human intellect memories and the ability to speak no matter what form he takes his skin hair and eyes remain green making most of his animal forms easy to distinguish from real animals of that species in the dc marvel crossover with the x men his attempt to infiltrate darkseid s forces and stop him from recreating dark phoenix was frustrated by the fact that darkseid s minions are not green in the early comics his coloration would change to that appropriate to the animal form he had taken with only his head remaining green when raven implanted garfield with an evil seed of her father trigon he began to transform into more demon like creatures eventually he found himself more comfortable in these horrific shapes than as a human and stayed shifted after becoming completely corrupted by the evil seed he was used by raven and trigon but eventually returned to normal titans vol 4 4 reveals that a small part of that seed still remains within him which trigon s sons manipulate using the demonic energies to open the portal to trigon s realm volume issue needed according to marv wolfman and george pérez the reason garfield is never seen shapeshifting into other humans although his powers should allow it is because any human he turns into would be green and there would be no point for him to use that ability unless he was turning into someone like the hulk 32 in the series tales of the teen titans it s implied that garfield also has unexplored psionic abilities although mento s psionic helmet is only capable of amplifying its user s psionic abilities citation needed garfield was shown to successfully use it to trick the teen titans into perceiving him as slade 33 he maintains great proficiency in hand to hand combat and is capable of defeating well trained hand to hand fighters though he s not considered to be at a level comparable to batman or deathstroke volume issue needed at one point he has displayed an ability to read lips which he used to discover an assassination plot that galtry devised against him 7 other versions edit a character called changeling is first seen in action comics
