youth he yearned to improve himself honing his body and mind to a sharp edge he studied the martial arts and eventually left for the east to learn from the masters anton learned of his father s death while travelling in the orient studying the martial arts at the funeral anton met his stepsister natalia also perhaps erroneously called natasha whom he had never met before and who had been raised in poverty the long separated stepsiblings fell in love and began a partnership natalia quickly became accustomed to the life of luxury anton had always known but the couple soon used up their inheritance in no small part because natalia needed expensive medical help due to a rare light sensitivity skin pigmentation disorder natalia and anton adopted a nocturnal existence to protect natalia from the damaging rays of the sun while continuing to use the expensive medical equipment to treat her skin sensitivity after the inheritance money began to run short anton and natalia decided to keep themselves in their accustomed lavish lifestyle through burglary following in their father s criminal footsteps clad in a black body suit anton used his martial arts and acrobatic prowess to rob gotham city s rich as the thief of night while natalia operated behind the scenes as nocturna mistress of the night 2 anton having spent much time in asia proved to be a highly capable martial artist however their burglary soon brought them into conflict with batman the two had several clashes with the darknight detective many of which ended with no clear cut victor for a while the night slayer even traded identities with a delirious batman after several clashes with batman anton was eventually captured and sent to prison nocturna remained free and continued her life of crime along with a new ally nightshade anton finally escaped and after being rejected by his beloved nocturna changed his style and became the murderous night slayer he killed nightshade an action which the more moral nocturna abhorred which is why she rejected him accusing anton of slaying the night after being betrayed too many times by nocturna anton vowed to kill her however that never occurred as he was again put in jail by the catwoman while nocturna seemingly died in an accident when last seen night slayer was freed from prison in a mass breakout engineered by ra s al ghul post crisis absence edit while his stepsister and former partner nocturna has returned to make various minor comics appearances over the years night slayer has been notably absent because of this it remains unclear if night slayer s existence is canonical in the post crisis universe powers and abilities edit night slayer is an expert martial artist in other media edit night slayer appears as an enemy in the nes batman videogame
