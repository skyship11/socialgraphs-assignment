fictional character biography edit origin story edit black mask s origin story was established in his first appearance roman sionis was born to wealthy and utterly self absorbed parents who cared more about their social status in gotham city than their own son moments after roman s birth the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head and his parents covered up the entire incident so that their high society friends would not find out years later he was attacked by a rabid raccoon at the sionis family country estate and his parents forbade him to mention the incident to anyone despite their dislike for fellow socialites thomas and martha wayne roman s parents continued to associate with them to maintain their social standing and forced roman to befriend their son bruce his parents hypocrisy had a deep impact on roman and he grew to resent them and the masks that they wore in public 6 after graduating from high school roman was given a high ranking position in his father s company janus cosmetics there he met and fell in love with working class model circe though his parents did not approve of the relationship and forced him to break it off enraged roman burned down his family mansion killing both of his parents and inheriting their fortune and business roman lacked his father s business acumen and eventually ruined janus cosmetics by funding a failed line of face paint make up desperate roman had the staff chemists create a product that was rushed to the market without proper testing disfiguring several hundred women circe now roman s fiancée then broke up with him in front of his entire staff 6 bruce wayne now the head of wayne enterprises offered to bail janus cosmetics out on the condition that roman gave up control and allowed wayne to appoint his own board of directors humiliated and furious roman broke into the cemetery where his parents were buried before he could unlock the sionis crypt a lightning bolt struck him blasting the door open and hurling roman head first into a nearby stone roman took the incident as an omen of his rebirth and entered the crypt smashing his father s ebony casket with the stone and using its shattered pieces to carve an ebony mask resembling a scowling face starting a new life as the crime lord black mask 7 criminal career edit within a month black mask had assembled a group of dozens of criminals called the false face society using the sionis crypt as their base of operations each member of the false face society wore a distinctive mask and the gang s crime spree spread rapidly throughout gotham eventually attracting the attentions of the police and bruce wayne now operating as the vigilante batman 8 to settle old scores black mask murdered three wayne foundation executives and kidnapped circe forcing her to don a mask laced with janus cosmetics toxic makeup sparing her life but permanently disfiguring her face black mask then threatened circe into rejoining him giving her a mannequin mask intentionally designed to mock her former life 8 batman eventually managed to deduce black mask s identity and correctly predicted that bruce wayne would be sionis next target 8 to set a trap for black mask bruce held a masquerade ball at wayne manor and sionis infiltrated the ball and lured bruce to the mansion s conservatory to kill him bruce disarmed sionis forcing the latter to retreat to his hideout with robin jason todd secretly following him while batman and robin fought his underlings at the graveyard black mask escaped through a false bottom installed in his father s coffin and headed to his family estate black mask then entered his old bedroom and set fire to the old toys inside intending to burn the mansion to the ground to symbolically kill his old identity as sionis before black mask could escape batman flung a batarang attached cable around the crime lord s knees causing him to fall face first on the burning floor just as the bedroom s rafters began to collapse the rafters pinned black mask s face into the pile of burning toys and although batman and robin were able to tow him out of the fire sionis mask had been burned onto his face 9 black mask was subsequently sent to arkham asylum where he remained behind bars until the international terrorist ra s al ghul freed all of its inmates black mask was not amongst the criminals who followed the joker in searching for the one behind the breakout and thus never took part in the war against batman s allies and loved ones as this tale was the last canonical one to take place on earth one it can be assumed that black mask remained at large 10 following crisis on infinite earths jeremiah arkham frees all of arkham asylum s inmates including black mask to attack batman during the events of the last arkham sionis then returns to crime after an unspecified breakout evidently retaining most of his pre crisis history he soon begins the false face society anew rising through the ranks of gotham

who wishes to join the false face society black mask demands the young man to make his bones first by crashing a masquerade ball being held at wayne manor batman later learns that the black spider is a double agent working for mobster turk ottoman and tracks him down to an abandoned theater where he prevents him from shooting black mask who subsequently escapes during the chaos 13 black mask
