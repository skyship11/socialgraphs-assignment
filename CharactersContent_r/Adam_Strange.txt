office asking them each to create a new science fiction hero one from the present and one from the future given first pick schiff chose to create one from the future space ranger schwartz was happy with the pick feeling that readers would more readily identify with a hero from the present 2 he conceived the idea of an earth man repeatedly traveling to a planet in the alpha centauri star system by using a zeta beam altered by space radiation 3 since adam strange was the first earthman on another planet he named his character adam after the biblical first man 4 adam strange debuted in issues 17 19 of the tryout series showcase published november 1958 march 1959 the first artwork of the character was a cover for showcase 17 by murphy anderson schwartz rejected the drawing and commissioned a new one by gil kane though anderson s costume design was retained 4 schwartz then assigned the scribing of the stories to gardner fox and the penciling to mike sekowsky 5 schwartz and fox devised the plots for the stories in schwartz s office and fox would write the scripts at home a science major schwartz specialized in giving fox scientific pointers that gave the adam strange tales a plausibility that made them stand out from most science fiction comic books of the time 4 sales on the three issue showcase tryout were enough to justify giving adam strange a slot in mystery in space which ran in issues 53 100 and 102 though schwartz and fox continued their work on the character schwartz gave the penciler assignment to carmine infantino instead of sekowsky most issues were inked by murphy anderson although bernard sachs joe giella and sid greene did a few issues each in the justice league of america comic book the flash mentioned adam strange as a possible new member for the justice league when a letter to the editor pointed out the group had not met adam strange and could not have heard of him as all his heroics took place on rann schwartz and fox wrote a story showing

ancient history 16 eventually his experiences accumulated on his adventures through the study and understanding of both rannian culture and its vast technologies as well as its vested history enabled

battled and bested adversaries both native and extraterrestrial in nature such as thanagarians durlans qwardians en tarans and meta humans 17 18 19 20 this along with his many decades of thriving in

of study on rann he is able to reverse engineer functional technological wonders even from the damaged remains of an alien ship with ease 22 he is also an accomplished mathematician who can expertly

marksman with just about any ranged weapon on hand at the time the gun comes with a targeting system conductor when worked in tandem with his costume and has a stun setting for non lethal application other munitions in his arsenal include holo blasters which are hard light energy arms that strange can use to conjure any number of ordinance or enhanced protective shielding with while in a firefight 32 the effectiveness of these armaments makes them potent enough in dispatching smite one of starro s lieutenants boasting physical capabilities rivalling superman or lobo 33 when properly calibrated by outside forces these energy weapons can also channel the light of a power ring or a facsimile of its corresponding emotion that can dispatch a small enclave of black lanterns 34 zeta beamer apparatus edit one of strange s as well as the planet of rann s greatest resource is the zeta beam technology developed by sardeth initially designed as a means of communications with intelligent life from across the universe it was accidentally discovered to be an instantaneous means of intergalactic transport that rode along a cosmic radiation called zeta rays 16 the effects of the ray were always short lived and their dissipation meant adam would return to where he first intercepted the ray this would be a running staple for years until later zeta designs made its effects permanent albeit at the cost debilitating mental sickness for its user 35 eventual innovations in rannian transport technology would produce a more streamlined device called the zeta beamer module an a i commanded mobile drone in the form of a floating sphere that could be used to track zeta rays across galaxies and even into alternate universes 36 like the mega zeta beam transport was also permanent without the danger of zeta ray sickness further modifications integrated the transport device into adam s space suit 37 other versions edit just imagine edit in just imagine created by stan lee adam
