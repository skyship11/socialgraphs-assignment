had lost i just knew it was there and by eight years old demonstrated photographic memory by rapidly reading a whole encyclopedia and retaining the information other skills manifested almost instantly he could play musical instruments without training and was secretly expert at sports to olympic record level in high school he saved a schoolmate from falling to her death by mental force but despite his powers he felt isolated from other humans because of his differences from them after leaving school he became a librarian in midwest city where he sought the help of a renowned physicist professor emery zackro who tested him and discovered adam was a mutant postulating he was the reverse of an evolutionary throwback an accidental specimen of future man 12 a his captain comet persona began when adam used his powers to intervene when criminals attempted to steal an advanced scientific device invented by professor zackro immediately after this blake and the professor agreed blake should become a superhero on a full time basis and he made his first appearance in public as captain comet combating giant terraforming robot tops belonging to an alien race looking for a world to colonize during this task adam built a working version of a prototype spaceship professor zackro had designed which would become his personal spaceship the cometeer and took up a costume spacesuit and stun gun also invented by the professor 12 b over the next three years he saved earth from multiple alien invasions and explored space in the cometeer saving other civilizations and meeting beautiful alien damsels in distress during this period he largely used intelligence and his mind reading skills to help solve problems seldom resorting to physical solutions among his weirder adventures captain comet battled mad greek gods from space 13 fought dinosaurs and alien creatures and came up against an evil super powered ape several times 14 15 sometime after 1954 he disappeared into space in the cometeer on another expedition of discovery but this time he would not return for over 20 years 1970s 1980s edit in 1976 captain comet returned to earth having not aged with a new protective costume instead of a

objects he also had an explanation for his absence having always felt alienated from normal humans because of his abilities he has been over 20 years in space 16 after misreading a battle between green lantern and gorilla grodd and some trickery by grodd he ended up joining the secret society of super villains and battled darkseid and the forces of apokolips with them 17 later he turned down full membership in the justice league but became an honorary member and took up residence in their satellite headquarters 18 after fighting chronos and dinosaurs in gotham city 19 the captain continued his crusade against the secret society of super villains despite a number of setbacks orchestrated by gorilla grodd 20 although present at the marriage of ray palmer and jean loring several months later 21 captain comet remained off radar for nearly two years eventually contacting superman when the effect of the comet that mutated him wore off turning him into a human comet whose powers fluctuated wildly 22 with superman s help he tracked down the comet and stabilized his powers superman s help was needed again six years later when the villain brain storm attempted to augment his waning powers by stealing captain comet s power which accidentally evolved him to a more advanced form temporarily 23 1990s l e g i o n r e b e l s edit he spent the next few years roaming the stars just drifting 24 before being captured by the space outlaw dagon ra 25 despite his new powers including near invulnerability telekinesis and increased strength rescued by l e g i o n he recuperated in their headquarters hospital and was invited to join them soon after 26 and did so a year later 27 his involvement with l e g i o n was in a supporting role he fell in love with fellow member scientist marij n bek who nursed him back to health and studied the massive headaches he frequently suffered these were the result of his possession by a psi creature in space before meeting l e g i o n it was eventually purged by vril dox leaving the captain once again hospitalised for months 28 soon after he was apparently killed by lady quark who had been possessed by the same parasite buried under a mountain on ith kaa 29 he eventually dug himself out 30 and used his knowledge to manipulate the savage indigenous population to achieve the technological level to build him a spaceship explaining later without irony that it took six months to industrialize the tribal society because they were slow learners 31 returning to r e b e l s homeworld of cairn he learned that vril dox s son lyrl had brainwashed most of the l e g i o n made the key l e g i o n members fugitives and taken control of cairn he and maryj n formed a resistance movement to free the population and overthrow lyrl and were key in successfully defeating him as a result captain comet became leader of the new reformed l e g i o n 32 during this period captain comet took up residence with tyrone an artificially created

was his own nephew he searched for the remains of his old body on hardcore station discovering that it had been stolen by the eternal light corporation church and he was being hunted by a team of their telepathic assassins 39 on breaking into the eternal light corporation s building he uncovered that brainwashed cloned telepaths were being grown from the charred remains of his corpse which he destroyed becoming a fugitive he hid from the e l c so they could not use his new body to continue their cloning allowing thousands of hardcore residents to die when the e l c cut off life support to a whole area of hardcore station to force them to surrender comet eventually he destroyed all the clones and the e l c also killing hundreds of their followers rann thanagar holy war strange

synnar a cosmic tyrant behind the eternal light corporation and lady styx on rann and thanagar which once again set the two planets on course for war their interference was eventually key in lord synnar s plans to reach a higher plane of existence 41 later comet learned from the future spirit of synnar that he is destined to be one of the aberrant six a group critical to preventing synnar trapped in the weird s body from destroying the universe ultimately the aberrant six did not form and the future synnar was forced to leave after comet s mercenary friend eye was killed by synnar s

evolution his mutant mental functions not only give him genius level i q but endow him with a photographic memory and telepathy enabling him to read or control people s minds including alien races he has telekinetic powers which enable him to use his thoughts to move lift and alter matter without physical contact mentally lift himself to fly at high speed create barriers of psychic force to deflect physical attack and fire bursts of psionic energy that strike with concussive impact sometimes in the form of lightning or fire blasts he has an accelerated healing and his telekinetic shield can simultaneously protect him from the vacuum of space and surround him with a breathable environment captain comet s brain also contains evolved sensory centers enabling him to clairvoyantly see events outside of his range of sight his evolved physiology originally made him superhumanly strong and durable enough to lift a large spaceship and fight toe to toe with beings such as lobo after his

others as well as himself but normally requires an hour to recharge after every jump other versions edit elseworlds edit captain comet has also appeared in a number of dc comics titles which do not
