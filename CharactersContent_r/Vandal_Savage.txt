nodell 1 in the story he has pointed demonic ears and reveals he is a million year old cro magnon man who was made ageless when he was exposed to gas from an exploding meteor the story ends when the green lantern alan scott causes savage to fall into a seemingly bottomless pit four years later he made his second appearance in all star comics 37 1947 wherein he was recruited to join the original injustice society a team of villains that battled the justice society of america the story featured savage targeting hawkman who decades later would be established as one of savage s most frequent enemies 2 during the silver age of comic books dc rebooted its universe of superheroes altering some character histories while also creating new versions of familiar characters the silver age version of the flash barry allen and his contemporaries were later said to live in the universe of earth one the golden age flash golden age green lantern and the justice society of america were retroactively said to be inhabitants of earth two where their stories took place this made vandal savage an inhabitant of earth two as well sixteen years after his second comic book story vandal savage returned in the flash 137 june 1963 this comic established he was closer to 50 thousand years old than 1 million years old and also revealed that his original name had been vandar adg after this he became a recurring enemy to the heroes of earth two and earth one sometimes crossing the dimensional barrier between the two realities frequently he battled the flashes and superman in action comics 515 516 1981 the story indicated vandal savage was no longer just ageless but could also heal from any physical injury even near disintegration the story shows savage seemingly reduced to ash by a meteorite but superman concludes the villain will still return in action comics 542 1983 this is proven correct and savage reveals his body was able to heal and reform even from near total destruction two years after vandal savage s return to comics in the silver age strange adventures 177 1965 introduced a hero called the immortal man whenever the immortal man died or was killed his powerful amulet allowed him to quickly materialize in a new body elsewhere on earth without having to literally be born again and with his memories intact the immortal man initially appeared in four stories then disappeared from comics for seventeen years he returned in a two part story in action comics 552 553 1984 written by marv wolfman with art by gil kane in this story it was said the immortal man and vandal savage were archenemies across history and had been since before they had gained their powers the immortal man s amulet was also revealed to be a piece of the same meteorite that made savage immortal the same story featured the immortal man forming a team of forgotten heroes to fight savage during the crossover crisis on infinite earths the immortal man seemingly died giving up his reincarnation energy to help save reality as a result of this crossover the histories of earth one and earth two were merged and revised into a new unified dc universe altering some character histories in the process the crossover was followed by history of the dc universe a two part mini series intended to establish the basic history of the new timeline although within a few years several parts of it were already dismissed and contradicted by new stories history of the dc universe 1 established for the first time that vandar adg s people were known as the blood tribe while the immortal man came from the bear tribe the same issue showed that the meteor which made vandal savage immortal also enhanced his intelligence and altered his body explaining why he resembled a modern homo sapiens when other stories claimed he was originally cro magnon over time new revelations were made about vandal savage such as the fact that he kept track of his children and descendants in case he needed to harvest them for organs and replacement parts since his ability to heal has weakened over time the comic book series resurrection man said savage and the immortal man were not made immortal by radiation or gases from the meteorite they encountered but by sub atomic robots it carried called tektites that entered their bloodstreams the same comic book series revealed that along with the immortal man savage has also regularly fought mitchell shelley the resurrection man across history likewise it was revealed that vandal savage had regularly fought the reincarnating heroes hawkman and hawkgirl across many of their lives sometimes being responsible for their deaths the crossover final crisis depicts characters believing vandal savage is the inspiration for the story of cain from the bible in 2011 dc rebooted its history again with the new 52 timeline in the new 52 series demon knights it was said that vandal savage worked alongside several heroes and warriors during the dark ages fighting evil rather than causing it during these days savage is a mirthful often drunk warrior who enjoys a fight as a break from boredom in 2016 dc rebirth restored much of the pre new 52 history while making some new changes the 2017 comic book dark days the forge and the 2018 series the immortal men established that vandal savage and the immortal man were part of a larger group of primitive humans who all became immortal as a result of encountering the meteor the council of immortals fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in his debut story vandal savage has pointed demonic ears but this is not seen again in subsequent stories vandal savage manipulates the green lantern and his secret identity alan scott into helping his schemes later revealing he knows they are the same person vandal savage explains that he is one million years old and was once a cro magnon man who was the chief of his tribe when a meteor exploded above him strange gases affected him he was left in a comatose state for months then woke up as an immortal barring accidents no longer aging but still vulnerable to injury savage does not reveal his original name to the green lantern but claims that over the years he has lived under many identities including an ancient king of sumer the egyptian architect cheops julius caesar and genghis khan when he realized he could still die from injury he decided to no longer act as a public man of power and instead would serve as an advisor to powerful leaders such as napoleon gaining resources and political influence while others could be the target for assassination now in the modern day he wishes to become a powerful figure in the government and war industry in the end he is defeated when green lantern opens a seemingly bottomless pit beneath him causing him to fall out of sight 3 years later he is revealed to be alive and recruited to the original incarnation of the injustice society a group dedicated to defeating the heroic justice society of america during this adventure he targets and captures jsa member hawkman the justice society proves victorious however and vandal savage is imprisoned 4 by the early 1950s the justice society members largely retire years later jay garrick the flash a founding member of the justice society is visited by barry allen the flash of a parallel universe and a founding member of the justice league barry designates his own home as earth one and the world of the justice society and injustice society as earth two after 16 years of prison vandal savage has his freedom again and lures the justice society members out of retirement capturing them he accidentally attracts the attention of barry allen who aids the older heroes against the villain as a result of the adventure the justice society decides to return to semi active duty 5 starting in this same story vandal savage is now said to be 50 000 years old rather than one million and his original name is revealed to be vandar adg the stories now say the meteor that mutated him did so through radiation rather than exotic gases and that it did not actually explode but warped through space and time a later story reveals that a fragment of the same radioactive meteor is recovered by a caveman named klarn of the bear tribe an enemy of vandar adg who then makes it into an amulet with this amulet klarn gains a unique reincarnation ability every time he is killed or died he quickly reappears elsewhere on earth in a new body fully clothed and with his memories of all past lives intact becoming one of savage s most frequent enemies over the millennia he is known to many as the immortal man 6 following his failure to hold the justice society prisoner vandal savage realizes he is not only aging but completely losing his immortality he learns that the meteor that made him immortal in the first place did not explode into ash as he thought but actually warped through space and time crossing through dimensions and into limbo savage manipulates jay garrick and barry allen into helping him free the meteor back into earth s atmosphere hoping another exposure will recharge his immortality instead it seemingly destroys him 7 since savage was shifting between the dimensions of earth one and earth two just before the meteor impacted with him he is now stuck in a partial existence between both worlds only able to achieve tangibility in one while only being a shadow form in the other he also temporarily gains the ability to project messages and images into the minds of others though he regains his full state of physical being later and returns to earth two he still fails to regain his immortality 8 later on he uses the superman of earth two as a power source to recharge his immortality savage hopes to also take all of superman s power but earth two s heroes arrive and foil the scheme 9 later on savage once again immortal alters the history of earth one so that he has been its ruler for centuries with superman serving as his trusted enforcer realizing savage is actually a cruel leader who censors news media so only good things are said about his rule superman joins the rebellion against the villain and then restores the original history traveling back in time to when he first gained his power savage is seemingly destroyed by the radiation of the meteor that made him immortal 10 later his body rebuilds itself from the ash either due to his healing always being this powerful or because the meteor s radiation temporarily enhanced his immortal abilities deciding to conquer the world through technology savage remains on modern day earth one and creates the technological research corporation abraxas in metropolis pretending to be an altruistic scientist and businessman while secretly continuing his plans for conquest and battling superman 11 later on the immortal man having apparently relocated to earth one recruits a team of forgotten heroes to combat savage s schemes 6 during the crisis on infinite earths when the multiverse is in danger of being destroyed vandal savage tries to take advantage of the chaos alongside many other villains several villains and heroes die during the crisis and the immortal man sacrifices himself to protect earth seemingly exhausting his reincarnation energy post crisis edit as a result of the crisis several universes merged into one single timeline creating a new version of history where the justice society and justice league had always lived on the same earth with one team forming decades after the other in this new history savage is still originally a cro magnon warrior called vandar adg now said to have been leader of the blood tribe 12 the post crisis version of savage is more bloodthirsty and it is suggested by some that he is the first cannibal on record in human history as with the silver age stories the meteor that made him immortal is one that travels by warping through space and time now specifically said to have originated from the future savage eventually learns the meteor didn t empower him through radiation but by infecting him with sub atomic robots it carried called tektites these tektites make him ageless and able to heal from great damage and lethal wounds while also increasing his intelligence making him more human in form and increasing his strength reflexes resiliency to injury and tolerance to pain the immortal man is still present at savage s origin and still fashions an amulet from a piece of the meteor it is now said the presence of tektites in both their bodies allows the two enemies to sense each other and sometimes be drawn to each other 13 though he is unaware of it at the time vandar adg had intestinal cancer when he was made immortal this affects the cancer cells as well preserving them and making them unable to be removed throughout the centuries the cancer causes savage great bouts of pain and discomfort 14 along with the immortal man savage makes enemies of many across history including the early human anthro 15 and the immortal mystic known as the phantom stranger 16 at different points in history savage faces batman due to the hero becoming temporarily lost wandering through time as a result of the final crisis 17 similarly savage often fights the time traveler rip hunter and his allies across the millennia 18 as he grows older savage realizes he has three human enemies who constantly reincarnate though unlike the immortal man they do so in the traditional sense needing to literally be reborn as children again following each death two of these enemies are known as prince khufu and his wife chay ara in their original lives fated to meet each other and fall in love in all subsequent lives in the early 20th century they are reborn as carter hall and shiera saunders hawkman and hawkgirl vandal savage compares the two reincarnating hawk heroes to cockroaches savage s other reincarnating enemy is a man named mitchell shelley who is reborn time and time again and usually recalls the events of his past lives leading him to essentially becoming the same person time and time again in many lives shelley fights vandal savage becoming his most frequent enemy next to the immortal man 19 vandal savage claims to have been several noteworthy figures of history but it has been shown that at least some of these boasts are false a means of taking credit and seeming more important at times he enjoys being a soldier for glory or a minor conqueror more often unwilling to test how much damage his immortality can repair he is content to be an advisor behind the scenes while temporarily living in ancient atlantis the center of magic on earth savage founds a secret society known as the children of the light this organization helps topple the power of atlantis before the continent sinks savage s followers leave and spread across earth becoming known as the illuminati savage serves as its secret leader for many years 18 in ancient egypt savage is known as khafre and makes an enemy of nabu who will one day merge with a human host to become the superhero doctor fate 18 as superheroes rise in the modern day savage believes he has found enemies worthy of fighting directly this leads him to confront green lantern alan scott in the 1940s and then join the injustice society to fight the hero s comrades when he later decides the justice society of america have become too formidable vandal savage uses his influence on several senators to shut the heroes down in 1951 the house un american activities committee openly questions if the jsa members are secret spies and communists pressuring them to reveal their identities and serve the u s government the jsa choose to retire instead which savage considers a victory as it means an end to widespread superhero activity for decades 20 at some point after the retirement of the jsa vandal savage fathers a daughter whom he names scandal as with many children he has had over the centuries vandal dismisses any notions of love or affection towards scandal however he comes to admire her warrior spirit and talent for violence leading him to protect her at times in the hopes that she will one day provide an even more formidable heir whom he can use many years later the debut of superman leads to the modern age of superheroes the justice league forms and vandal savage winds up opposing them by this time savage has begun funding clandestine terrorist organizations and advanced scientific research both to increase his resources and due to his realizing his immortality is weaker than it used to be savage starts tracking down his descendants in order to rely on them for organ transplants if he needs them as his body now has a harder time regenerating full organs if they are too greatly damaged related to this he funds research into cloning wally west the latest hero to be called the flash realizes vandal savage is hiding under the alias of burt villers an art dealer the two have a brief battle 21 soon afterward one of savage s scientific projects leads to the creation of velocity 9 a highly addictive drug that imbues a person with superhuman speed savage releases this drug to criminals who then perform high speed crimes but the velocity 9 causes accelerated aging and severe strokes the velocity 9 scheme is thwarted by wally west 22 later on wally s friend and fellow teen titans founder roy harper known as arsenal is revealed to be one of savage s descendants 23 soon after the crisis on infinite earths savage captures the immortal man he then funds the lab a group attempting to recreate the tektites that make the villain immortal the lab experiments on blood samples taken from both savage and the immortal man hoping to understand the sub atomic technology 24 by this time mitchell mitch shelley has reincarnated now living as a lawyer in viceroy south carolina though suffering from visions and dreams of his past lives shelley is unable to learn the full truth of his past before he is targeted for death by enemies though he survives he wanders the streets brain damaged and amnesiac later he is coincidentally kidnapped by the lab as savage s organization is now testing its tektite technology by injecting it into homeless people and seeing if they survive lethal injuries shelley s ability to reincarnate and remember his past lives seems to interact with the tektites turning him into a resurrection man now whenever he is killed he always returns and each time he does so he possesses a different additional super power after escaping the lab shelley s memories return in part and he recalls his long time rivalry with vandal savage with the forgotten heroes shelley confronts savage and learns the immortal man has been his prisoner for years when a tektite empowered creature emerges from a time warp apparently from the same source that produced the meteor that gave vandal savage and immortal man their power years ago it causes chaos and starts to disrupt reality shelley immortal man and savage join forces against the creature in the end the immortal man uses his own tektite field to overload the creature s own technology killing them both in the process 13 when the now adult founding members of the teen titans decide to reform the group under the name the titans they soon interfere with one of vandal savage s schemes to counter them savage creates his own team of villains known as tartarus the mythological prison of the ancient titans 25 the members include the red panzer gorilla grodd lady vic siren and cheshire both an enemy of the titans and the mother of roy harper s child lian tartarus targets adeline wilson a leader of the terrorist group the h i v e to use her blood for a new immortality serum before the titans can stop him savage slits wilson s throat the red panzer dies in the subsequent battle savage then shoots cheshire distracting the titans as he and his other recruits escape the titans then rescue their old teammate omen from tartarus and the tide is turned after the siren changes sides the villain group disbands 26 soon before the events of infinite crisis vandal savage joins the newly reorganized secret society of super villains now simply calling itself the society meanwhile his now adult daughter scandal savage joins the newest group to call itself the secret six a team that opposes the society s agenda savage later reveals that he believes scandal and her secret six teammate the catman would produce a suitable and formidable heir scandal however is romantically involved with the woman knockout seeing this as defiance savage threatens knockout and the team 27 vandal savage becomes leader of a doomsday cult and endows his followers with a variety of superhuman abilities thanks to a serum based on his own blood though they lose these abilities without regular injections his recruit fantasia then casts illusions to trick the flash into bringing savage an alien summoner device deciding that the planet is overpopulated and no longer an enjoyable place for him to live savage intends to use the summoner to force the thanatos asteroid to crash to earth causing an apocalypse event and thinning out the herd of the human race the flash reverses the effect of the device pushing the asteroid away but then savage leaps into the path of the beam believing he will gain greater power from the asteroid just as a meteor once gave him power before as he is sent to the asteroid he declares that he will protect the flash and his family and heirs as thanks for wally west s help in his achievement of new power 28 as savage vanishes his followers are rounded up and their abilities fade savage s immortality allows him to survive on the meteor and he later returns to earth by hitching a ride on a comet that is headed in that direction 29 a story in jsa classified 10 13 depicts savage with his immortality and regenerative abilities now drained and suffering from a brain tumor believing he will die soon savage decides to try one last act of revenge against alan scott the first superhero he ever fought and his first true enemy of the modern era when this fails savage consumes a clone of himself in order to restore his power at least temporarily this story claims savage no longer has descendants to harvest for survival and says he is only 37 000 years old both of which contradict comics published before and afterward leaving the story s place in canon questionable 30 savage later returns as the mastermind behind a group of superhuman neo nazis called the fourth reich targeting the heirs of several golden age superheroes they kill the heroes minute man general glory and mister america along with their families the fourth reich kills nearly all of commander steel s family the battle ends when the fourth reich is defeated and savage is struck down by a fire truck 31 final crisis edit main articles final crisis and final crisis

entering nazi occupied territories they plunge the spear of destiny into savage s body causing the spirit of cain to be reborn in him 32 using the spear savage cain separates the spectre the spirit of vengeance from his human host then enslaves him 33 savage cain s plans are undone by renee montoya the vigilante known as the question who manages to steal the spear and reunite the spectre with his host the spectre sentences savage to walk the earth unable to disguise the mark of cain on his face to be reviled and denied rest until god says otherwise 34 the superhero team known as the outsiders meet a group calling themselves the insiders members of savage s tribe who were also exposed to the power of the meteor he encountered all gaining immortality as a result the insiders seek out meteorite fragments of the original meteor while savage forms a temporary alliance with the near immortal terrorist cult leader ra s al ghul to thwart the group by this time savage begins to believe he is in fact the biblical figure cain he succeeds in ridding himself of the mark of cain by passing it on to the question 35 montoya then removes the mark of cain from herself simply by acknowledging her flaws and shortcomings a feat vandal savage could never consider 36 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe vandal savage gained immortality and superhuman strength by encountering a small meteorite that broke off from a radioactive comet that passed by earth savage later learns that this meteor nearly struck krypton before but was deflected by an ancestor of superman s during the dark ages and the time of king arthur savage joins with etrigan the demon madame xanadu and the shining knight to form the demon knights fighting powerful forces that threaten

he finds himself losing his powers superman eventually learns that savage is responsible for his power drain after somehow infecting superman with a form of radiation that hinders his body s ability to absorb sunlight after capturing most of the justice league and stealing superman s fortress of solitude savage reveals that the comet which empowered him before will be passing by earth again and he intends to collect it with the aid of some of his mortal descendants all of whom gain power as the comet approaches reaching the comet he gains greater power and attempts to recruit superman to his side after superman is able to cure himself of the radiation inhibiting his powers through a risky form of kryptonite chemotherapy rejecting savage s offer superman sends the comet away causing savage to revert to his default form and power level 39 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 in the new history vandal savage is one of a group of five people who are made immortal by a radioactive meteorite that fell to earth many thousands of years before recorded history this group becomes the council of immortals hoping to shape the human race from the shadows each of these immortals including savage can share their ability to stop aging with others creating

changes depending on the battle sometimes he employs swords knives and maces while other times he wields advanced technology such as energy based weapons a suit that allows him limited flight or a pen sized sonic device that can immobilize people with super speed in the original golden age and silver age stories vandal savage was ageless but could still die by injury which is the traditional definition of immortality over time he began gradually aging and then lost his immortality completely in the twentieth century before finding a way to regain it for a brief time when he existed out of phase with his home dimension of earth two savage was able to mentally project messages and images 43 starting in the 1980s savage was depicted not only as ageless but also having superhuman healing abilities meaning his body could repair itself from lethal damage and destruction he also exhibited greater strength speed reflexes resiliency to injury and tolerance to pain than the average human being in the 1990s it was revealed that the source of his power was not radiation induced mutation but a colony of sub atomic robots called tektites inhabiting his bloodstream and cells these tektites work to preserve and rebuild his body by any means necessary over time this immortality has weakened and savage has had to rely on his children descendants or clones for organ replacement and blood transfusions he has also funded research into tektite replication later stories revealed savage had intestinal cancer when he acquired his immortality the regenerative power that keeps him alive also keeps the cancerous cells from being removed throughout his life this causes savage intermittent bouts of pain 14 savage s blood can be used to create a serum that can imbue another person with superhuman powers the nature of these superhuman abilities is unpredictable the powers cannot be maintained without regular injections of the serum 28 following dc rebirth it is indicated that savage s blood can also be used to make another person ageless during the final crisis crossover event savage bore the metaphysical mark of cain on his face though the mark could vanish if the bearer recognized their own shortcomings and flaws savage did not realize this and passed it on to another person in the new 52 timeline savage was mutated by radiation from a passing comet one which had almost destroyed the planet krypton years before 44 this gave him not only immortality and advanced healing but also superhuman strength when savage later encountered the comet again his proximity to it increased his power giving him flight organic armor and an energy field of an unknown nature when the comet was destroyed savage apparently lost these extra abilities children edit over the millennia savage has occasionally fathered children and has many descendants alive on earth one such descendant is roy harper savage s more recent children who still live include his daughter scandal
