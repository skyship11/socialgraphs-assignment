man was created by writer john broome and penciler carmine infantino with significant input from editor julius schwartz who wanted a new supporting character for the flash 4 julius schwartz has noted that elongated man was only created because he had not realized that plastic man was available due to dc obtaining the rights to him in 1956 alongside other quality comics properties however infantino and inker murphy anderson stated that he never used him as a reference for anything 5 6 7 in his 2000 autobiography the amazing world of carmine infantino the artist wrote i really liked elongated man because it was comical and i enjoyed drawing comedy it was also one of my favorite strips because it was as close to animation as i could do in a comic book i liked being able to test the limits of the comic book form and this strip allowed me to do that 8 elongated man received a solo backup feature in detective comics where he was redefined as a detective who loves odd mysteries and travels the united states in a convertible with his wife searching for them 9 sometimes they would travel the world or meet other dc superheroes like batman green lantern the atom and zatanna this feature

fictional fruit called gingo it was revealed in invasion 3 that he is a metahuman and the gingoid elixir interacted with his latent genes an ordinary human would not develop such powers through ingesting the extract in fact most people are extremely allergic to highly concentrated gingold the only other hero in the dcu who uses gingold is stretch a member of hero hotline who has been using the compound since the 1940s as his name suggests elongated man can stretch his limbs and body to super human lengths and sizes these stretching powers grant him heightened agility enabling flexibility and coordination that is beyond the natural limits of the human body he can contort his body into various positions and sizes impossible for ordinary humans such as being entirely flat so that he can slip under a door or using his fingers to pick conventional locks he can also use it for disguise by changing the shape of his face although this is painful and difficult for him ralph s physiology has greater physical limitations than plastic man there is a limit to how far he can stretch his finite bodily mass and he cannot open holes in his body as plastic man can elongated man s powers also greatly augment his durability he is largely able to withstand corrosives punctures and concussions without sustaining injury it has been demonstrated that he is resistant to high velocities that would kill an ordinary person and that he is also more resistant to blasts from energy weapons that would kill ordinary humans his physiology is more like that of an ordinary human than plastic man and as a result he does not share plastic man s nigh invulnerability in addition to his stretching abilities elongated man is a professional detective and highly skilled in deductive reasoning often considered one of the most brilliant detectives in the dc universe comparable to batman he is a talented amateur chemist as well a meta side effect of his powers coupled with his
