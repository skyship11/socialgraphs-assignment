first appeared in superman 264 june 1973 in a story written by cary bates and penciled by curt swan 3 when editor julius schwartz suggested adding a sportscaster to clark kent s news reporter bates decided to create a workplace adversary for kent to contrast with kent s friendly relationship with the other characters drawing partial inspiration from the character ted baxter of the mary tyler moore show 4 lombard s physical model was real life football star joe namath 4 for several years after steve lombard s debut he appeared in nearly every published superman story action comics writer martin pasko later attempted to explain the character s popularity lombard is one of the few examples of a character that all of us superman scripters at that time wrote in more or less the same way as opposed to say the way lana lang seemed to be a totally different character when she d show up in action on occasion i think that s because lombard was one of the most sharply drawn and purposefully designed though not particularly complex characters i ve ever handled the most clearly communicated idea i ve ever heard from an editor and the writer who co created it the jock doofus unwittingly trying to bust superman s cajónes the audience waits for it knowing that a hotfoot with a match won t trump a hotfoot from heat vision or whatever and i gather the other superman writers thought so too that s why lombard became for me at least one of the best examples of what in sitcoms we call the run through character that s certainly what ted baxter was on tv the character you knew you could run through a scene and get laughs just from his showing up the audience starts laughing when they show up because they re laughing at what they re imagining is gonna happen they re waiting for it 4 bates wrote steve lombard out of the comic in superman 384 though his final pre crisis on infinite earths appearance was not until superman 413 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in pre crisis continuity steve the slinger lombard is a quarterback for the fictional nfl team the metropolis meteors the day before his team is to play in the super bowl steve exacerbates

uniform the energy being responds to lombard s thoughts and begins scoring touchdowns in his place as lombard had missed most of the game due to his accident initially taking credit for the energy being s performance lombard publicly confesses the truth after the being goes on a rampage and has to be stopped by superman steve resigns from the meteors and retires from football over his actions leading morgan edge to hire him as a sportscaster for galaxy broadcasting working alongside anchor clark kent on the six o clock news 1 5 steve is portrayed as brash and arrogant and often plays childish pranks on clark kent addressing him as clarkie which kent usually counters with the subtle use of his super powers however steve also considers clark one of his few real friends since he takes steve s behavior in stride and never bears him a grudge steve has a brother named vernon who is a doctor and a nephew named jaime 6 steve also has an aunt kaye daye who is a mystery novelist who works with the mystery analysts of gotham city 7 morgan edge ultimately fires steve after many years due to his declining popularity with the viewing audience steve goes to clark s apartment seeking
