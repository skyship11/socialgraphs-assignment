die on mercy reef which is above sea level at low tide causing fatal air exposure to atlanteans because of his blond hair which was seen by the superstitious atlanteans as a sign of a curse they called the mark of kordax the only individual who spoke up on orin s behalf was vulko a scientist who had no patience for myth or superstition while his pleas fell on deaf ears vulko would later become a close friend and advisor to the young orin as a feral child who raised himself in the wilds of the ocean with only sea creatures to keep him company orin was found and taken in by a

his enemy the ocean master share the same father an ancient atlantean wizard named atlan this revelation sends orin into a bout of rage and depression setting the stage for later confrontations

from a previous battle with aquaman during the recent crisis the dweller confusing this new arthur for aquaman and calling him his charge tells arthur and king shark of a prophecy regarding arthur s

your people and became the vessel of power strange ancient and terrible arthur s first trip to atlantis and the oceans causes him to meet many of aquaman s supporting characters including mera the sea

kryptonite superman and batman journey deep below the sea where they find a large amount of the substance the two of them are met with hostility by aquaman and king shark a brief fight ensues but

part human to understand that 78 joseph curry would continue to be the stand in king of atlantis until after the final crisis storyline it was revealed that joseph had stepped down from his position due to being unable to deal with the pressure of carrying on the aquaman legacy tempest later finds joseph s trident and costume draped over a throne confirming that he had abandoned his duties as atlantis king 79 this is the final real reference to arthur joseph curry with the character never appearing again or being referenced in any dc material since that point the character has yet to reappear after two of dc comics major relaunches 2011 s the new 52 and 2016 s dc rebirth powers and abilities edit marine telepathy edit aquaman s most widely recognized power is the ability to communicate with marine life which he can summon from great distances this was originally described in the stories as an ability to actually speak with fish in a similar manner to dr dolittle s ability to speak to animals 80 this portrayal of his powers was later retconned into the ability to communicate with them telepathically he once stated that this power more relied on encouraging and compelling the subject rather than full control citing piranha as a species he has trouble commanding under any circumstances due to their ruthlessness and hunger in the new 52 onwards aquaman s telepathy abilities changed acknowledging that most marine life does not possess enough intelligence to carry on a meaningful telepathic communication aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum 64 it is later revealed during drowned earth event that arthur s ability to speak with the ocean comes from a metaphysical energy known as the life force 81 a vast ocean of genesistic power which enables him to connect with any and all forms of sentience within the cosmos even from across realities 82 through it arthur could also use its power to revert lost forms and assert varying consciousnesses within like making the human shell of mother salt s monster daughter the cailleach subservient to her human host s will even restoring the true forms and divine powers of long forgotten ocean gods while calling out to them through his aquatelepathy 83 physical abilities edit the character has a number of other superhuman powers most of which derive from the fact that he is adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of underwater environments he has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough to withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire 84 aquaman frequently displays feats of super atlantean the average atlantean can lift press approximately two tons and superhuman strength while not on par with superman and wonder woman he has proven capable of leaps up to six miles 85 he can swim at extremely high speeds capable of reaching speeds of 3 000 meters per second 84 10 800 km roughly 6 700 miles per hour and can swim up niagara falls 86 he can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing granting limited sonar 2 although aquaman can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects he grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods originally when batman invented aquaman s water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a dehumidifier 2 this weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011 establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his atlantean heritage 87 but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments such as deserts 88 aquaman had also been bestowed an ability he never showcased before given to him by an old sea monarch granting him the ability of unaided flight using his own power 89 other powers and abilities edit while typically able to mostly telepathically commune with marine animals aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea e g sea eagles or even any being evolved from marine life e g humans and some aliens pre flashpoint aquaman has had an ill defined level of telekinetic capability he would use every so often it s very very rarely touched upon and the only times he ever used it few and far between often applying these abilities as a focus for team battles to strengthen combo attacks with other supers 90 at various times in his life aquaman has been transformed into a purely oceanic entity with power over all the seas of the world 91 this was usually temporary as he would often revert to normal afterwards 92 93 94 weapons and equipment edit trident of neptune edit before the new 52 the trident granted by poseidon to the rightful ruler and protector of the seas was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon which aquaman wielded with unmatched skill apart from its power as a melee weapon the trident also had the power to manipulate water fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others most notably tempest 95 in the new 52 the trident of neptune also called atlan s trident or the trident of atlan is a weapon in which is part of a collection of seven very powerful atlantean magical items forged by the first king of atlantis who calls himself the dead king 96 initially thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set with the possible exception of the recently discovered seventh item the trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents such as the evil new god darkseid in one instance the trident was shown glowing with magical power when black manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one sometimes when arthur utilizes the trident of neptunee s supernatural powers his eyes glow with arcane power and this further strengthens his abilities as well as giving him various arcane energy based capabilitie 97 trident of poseidon edit in the new 52 onwards the trident in which is usually the favored weapon of poseidon was given to aquaman by the sea god 98 poseidon s trident has displayed the power to summon tsunamis and deluges 99 and call down thunder and lightning 100 project and control ice move landmasses and grant the ability for aquaman to teleport himself across global and even interplanetary distances using water as a medium 101 it can also transform into a gladius a type of sword used by ancient roman gladiators and back into a trident at will 102 prosthetic hand edit after the loss of his left hand aquaman initially replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook then a liquid metal hand the mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water his biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in blackest night 8 waterbearer hand edit a magical hand made out of water it was given given to him by the lady of the lake which granted aquaman numerous abilities these included the ability to instantly dehydrate to death anyone he touched shoot jets of scalding or freezing water from it healing abilities the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions that could act as spontaneous transport control and negate magic manipulate almost any body of water he sets his focus on 2 and the capability to communicate with the lady of the lake 103 other versions edit earth two edit in the 1960s following the establishment of dc comics s multiverse system 104
