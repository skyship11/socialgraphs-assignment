find a way for humanity to survive the fallout through forced evolution one of the test subjects in his experiments was his 16 year old daughter kole whom he grafted with crystal and promethium a fictionalized version of the real world element promethium instead of evolving to survive a nuclear fallout as her father intended kole found herself with the ability to create and control pure silicon crystal at will kole as shown in the new teen titans 9 1985 kole was then kidnapped by the mad sun titaness thia for two years thia forced kole to use her powers to construct a crystal prison in which thia could hold important prisoners thia eventually came into conflict with the teen titans which ultimately led to the death of the goddess and kole winning her freedom lilith a member of the titans with limited precognition sensed the dark clouds of destruction around kole and warned her that she would face a grim future should she return to earth and invited her to remain in olympus kole declined electing to reclaim her life on earth now back on earth kole tried to reunite with her parents only to find that her father s experiments had produced a house full of crystalline and insectoid monstrosities when the titans came to confront him he had them captured and attempted to subject them to the same experiments kole helped them to escape and in the ensuing conflict the lab self destructed abel his wife marilyn and the rest of their test subjects emerged from the wreckage transformed into insect forms which would allow them to survive a nuclear holocaust having nowhere else to go kole chose to go with the titans to new york city though she never officially joined the group she was certainly considered a titan by some members evidenced later in stories such as the secret origins of the teen titans in which dick grayson laments how kole was a titan for such a short time lacking a home of her own kole lived with adeline and joseph wilson as a result of this kole developed an immediate friendship with jericho she was deeply upset when jericho along with a few other titans went on a mission to deep space yet could not accompany jericho with whom she had fallen in love shortly after this in the pages of crisis on infinite earths kole attempted to save the earth 2 robin and earth 2 huntress from the anti monitor s shadow demons she failed and all three were apparently killed their bodies never found in grant morrison s animal man storyline deus ex machina psycho pirate while in arkham asylum recreated characters removed from continuity kole or a pre crisis version of her was one of them kole appears as she originally did presumably this character vanished from existence when the psycho pirate s episode of madness ended along with her colleagues she appeared in team titans 8 12 the implication at the time being that she was a ghost of some sort later on in 24 after a year of not appearing she was shown in monarch s lair implying she was one of his puppets and has been removed from continuity years later during the infinite crisis event kole was briefly resurrected and placed under the control of brother blood who forced her to battle the newest incarnation of teen titans she was defeated and returned to the grave along with the other undead titans kole would briefly resurface one year later when kid eternity summoned her from the afterlife to help locate the soul of kid devil s aunt marla after kid devil tells kole that he had read about her in the titans archives and thinks she is cool she expresses gratitude and says she wishes that he could have been a member of the team while she was still alive she then returns to her resting place leaving the two heroes to continue on their own powers and abilities edit kole has the power to spin crystal which is to create silicon crystal into independent masses anything from a crystal sculpture to a safety slide she is known to encase people in crystal effectively immobilizing them it is not clear what happens to the crystal she spins whether it eventually breaks down or remains in existence has never been established she once spun a crystal bridge to transport herself and jericho from manhattan to titans tower in the east river what happened to that bridge is subject to debate kole also has the ability to fly but it is unclear whether this also comes from the experiments that gave her powers or granted to her during her tenure as thia s slave later in the teen titans comics kole is seen transporting herself on a crystal carpet only once has kole been seen moving through crystal or at least the crystal she spun herself 1 alternate versions edit earth one edit in teen titans earth one kole is one of the children given powers from the titans project
