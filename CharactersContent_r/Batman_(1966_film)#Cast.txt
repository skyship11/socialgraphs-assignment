animals not knowing that bruce wayne is batman s alter ego after bruce wayne fights his way out of captivity he again disguises himself as batman and the dynamic duo returns to the united underworld s hq only to find a smoking bomb batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks in hopes of locating a safe place to dispose of the bomb but does so in the nick of time the penguin disguises himself as the commodore and schemes his way into the batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen this plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck the penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water used to recharge the batcave s atomic pile leaving them highly unstable ultimately batman and robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated united world organization s security council consisting of ambassadors from japan the u s the u s s r israel france spain west germany the united kingdom and nigeria giving chase in the batboat to retrieve them and miss kitka presumed by the duo as still captive robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable the penguin s submarine and force it to surface where a fist fight ensues

powdered council members vials and sneezes on them scattering the dust batman sets to work constructing an elaborate super molecular dust separator to filter the mingled dust robin asks him whether it might be in the world s best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another in response batman says that they cannot do so reminding robin of the fate of the penguin s henchmen and their tainted rehydration and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own with the world watching the security council is re hydrated all members are restored alive and well but continue to squabble amongst themselves totally oblivious of their surroundings however each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to robin that this strange mixing of minds does more good than harm the duo quietly leaves united

with bikini clad women 7 production edit william dozier wanted to make a big screen film to generate interest in his proposed batman television series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras the studio 20th century fox refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie while it would only have to share the cost of a tv series a much less risky proposition 8 the studio acquiesced after a 1965 screening of columbia pictures s 1943 the batman serial in new york city renewed interest in the character and after the television series became phenomenally successful the project was announced in a march 26 1966 issue of variety magazine 9 the film features many characters from the show it was written by series writer lorenzo semple jr and directed by leslie h martinson 10 who had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes the penguin goes straight and not yet he ain t semple jr completed the screenplay in 10 days principal photography began on april 28 1966 and concluded within 28 days with a further three days to complete second unit photography 9 tone and themes edit even though it is often described like many contemporary shows as a parody of a popular comic book character some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined they felt the film s depiction of the caped crusader captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly 11 the film was made at a time when the batman of the golden age comics was already essentially neutered 12 certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of batman the movie like the tv series is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of batman such as the escapes done almost out of luck 12 the penchant for giving devices a bat prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media however the majority of batman s campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid 1960s culture in general 13 furthermore the movie represented batman s first major foray into cold war issues paying heavy attention to polaris missiles war surplus submarines and taking a poke at the pentagon the inclusion of a glory hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of security council members marked batman s first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics 14 vehicles edit the batmobile as seen in the 1960s batman tv series besides the batmobile other vehicles used by the dynamic duo include batcycle with side car batboat provided by glastron batcopter of the three new batvehicles which first appeared in the batman film only the batcycle properly crossed over into the tv series as the budgetary limits of the tv series precluded the full use of the others while the batcopter and batboat from the movie appeared briefly in episodes including a use of the batboat in the conclusion of the first post film two parter walk the straight and narrow they primarily did so in the form of stock footage scenes from the film intercut into
