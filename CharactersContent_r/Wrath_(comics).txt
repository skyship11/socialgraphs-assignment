publication history edit the wrath s debut story was titled the player on the other side published in batman special 1 1984 the title was based on the essay a liberal education and where to find it by thomas henry huxley although mistakenly attributed to aldous huxley by bruce wayne it is also a reference to the ellery queen novel of the same name as the story s author mike w barr is a renowned queen enthusiast a post infinite crisis legacy version of the wrath debuted in the pages of batman confidential 13 in a story arc written by tony bedard with elliott caldwell the student of the original wrath taking on his mentor s mantle fictional character biography edit the original wrath edit the original wrath art by michael golden the first wrath was an enemy of batman described by him as his opposite number 2 the wrath s appearance and motivation are reminiscent of batman s but with notable differences the wrath like batman is distinguished by perfectionism and obsession with what he does his costume is also very similar to batman s though colored in crimson and purple with a w insignia on the chest and cowl the w on his cowl when seen in the right light and at the right angle looks like the ears of the batman s cowl wrath s parents were a couple of burglars like joe chill the man who shot and killed batman s parents they were killed in a shootout with a police officer coincidentally the same day that batman s parents were gunned down in crime alley due to this the wrath dedicated his life to a campaign of revenge against law and law enforcers 3 independently of one another batman and the wrath adopted strikingly similar costumes and skill sets although they used them for opposite purposes when the wrath finally returns to gotham city he comes to kill the man who had shot his parents the wrath s target turns out to be commissioner gordon of the gotham city police which leads to the wrath coming into conflict with batman in the course of their impersonal battle of wits the wrath learns batman s secret identity as bruce wayne and proceeds to attack several of his friends alfred pennyworth is hospitalized and leslie thompkins is taken hostage by the wrath during his rooftop showdown with batman one of the wrath s explosive capsules detonates during the fight batman s attempt to throw the wrath off of him leads to the villain accidentally landing in his fire and falling over the edge to his death looking down from the rooftop batman remarks that watching wrath s death felt like watching his own in wrath child batman confidential 13 16 several details of the wrath s origin underwent a retcon including the original story taking place shortly after dick grayson became robin the original story was published the same year that grayson became nightwing with grayson missing the events because he was away at the time on an educational holiday one of the various training missions batman sent him on the wrath s father is now depicted as a corrupt cop who was robbing a warehouse with his wife and so acting as a lookout gordon confronted them and in a gunfight killed the parents in self defense additionally the wrath is now depicted as having copied batman whereas in his original appearance this is never suggested and it is implied that they both developed nearly identical personas independently when batman hears the story of the wrath s origins from the original s successor the young wrath ii claims that only his predecessor s father was armed and gordon shot to kill first but in reality his father fired first and then his mother took up his father s gun with gordon s shots only being fatal because his aim was off due to his injuries it is unclear if the young wrath ii believed this story because he heard it from his mentor or if his mentor told him the truth and then twisted it to make the wrath seem like a victim abandoned by the cops to conceal the corruption gordon going along with the plan because then captain gillian b loeb threatened to kill the boy as he was the only witness if he talked the wrath became a contract killer in the hopes of avenging his parents again and again while preparing to assassinate gordon the wrath studied batman and initially planned to dress just like him to needle gordon however he concluded that they were kindred spirits inspired by a similar disaster in their lives and duplicated batman s costume and equipment as an homage to the extent that he began training his own robin who went on to become the wrath ii 4 elliot caldwell edit elliot caldwell as the wrath ii on the cover of batman confidential 15 may 2008 art by rags morales sporting an all purple costume this wrath who batman deduces is a copycat from his first appearance owing to the differences in age physical build and training begins murdering police officers visiting gotham for a convention and breaks into gayle hudson s apartment 5 after a fight with batman during which he confirms that he is not the original wrath and is unaware of batman s true identity he tells the dark knight to investigate commissioner gordon s actions on june 26 25 years ago the same night that bruce wayne s parents died 6 upon another meeting with batman the wrath ii tells a distorted version of the events that happened although it is unclear if he is reciting the version he learned from the wrath or if he has twisted it in his mind saying gordon killed the wrath s parents in cold blood though batman saw through this and realized that gordon shot them in self defense 4 his subsequent assessment of the original wrath helps batman determine the identity of the second one as the wrath sought to duplicate all of batman s methods batman concludes that the wrath ii must be the wrath s equivalent of robin batman and nightwing upon confronting the wrath ii for a final time reveal that they have learned that the wrath ii s real name was elliot caldwell an orphaned boy whom the wrath trained to be his answer to robin based on a psychological profile run by alfred looking for children in dick s age range who disappeared around the time that the wrath was active elliot was one of five orphans who the original wrath kidnapped and trained but he was the only one who survived the training despite caldwell s refusal to believe their claims and his subsequent efforts to continue fighting he was stopped by batman and nightwing whose teamwork and care for each other forced caldwell to recognize that he had never had the same relationship with his mentor he was subsequently sent to blackgate penitentiary although he reflected that he would be ready to face them again in the future now that his emotional weakness had been purged the new 52 edit in september 2011 another version of the wrath appeared during the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in the new timeline e d caldwell is the ceo of caldwell tech who appears as a legitimate magnate trying to buy wayne enterprises when a series of policeman murders strikes gotham batman deduces that caldwell is a sociopath killer using the company to create an army of soldiers called scorn namely a thug named clyde anderson and adopting the codename of the wrath caldwell manages to capture alfred pennyworth and plans to murder him 7 8 after failing to kill batman the wrath kills anderson while preparing his suit to face batman in combat 9 the wrath then went after batman as he chased him in his plane through the streets of gotham forcing batman to abandon his batplane to gain more time and cause it to self destruct and him to escape on his bat glider alfred after having hacked caldwell s files revealed to bruce that elliot s father had been killed by corrupt gotham police officers elliot later used his tank to bomb gotham city station he then got out of his tank expecting to find a mass of dead police officers instead he found only batman as bruce had convinced james gordon to evacuate the building where batman in a modified suit similar in style to the wrath s proceeded to beat down elliot however he did not deliver the finishing blow he instead allowed the gotham police department to open fire on him and revealed to him that it was james gordon who brought down the police officers who killed his father and proceeded to knock him out helped by the gotham city police department the batman finally defeats the wrath while in blackgate penitentiary the wrath is greeted by gordon after which the wrath meets with emperor blackgate where they both begin a partnership 10 in other media edit a variation of the wrath and scorn appear in the batman animated television series episode the end of the batman voiced by christopher gorham and daryl sabara respectively william mallory and his younger brother andrew andy mallory were the children of jewel thieves who were eventually caught and convicted on the same night that thomas and martha wayne were shot being young children at the time the event motivated the young mallories to become the wrath and scorn to help criminals in their crimes and defend them from batman under the belief that criminals have a right to make a living just as much as innocents while helping gotham city s criminals the mallories come into conflict with batman and robin though in their civilian identities they befriend those of the dynamic duo bruce wayne and dick grayson ultimately it is this friendship that leads to the four deducing each other s identities while the mallories are eventually captured they plan to reveal the dynamic duo s secret identities while batman was willing to accept the outcome the joker was not as he did not want to lose his greatest source of fun and poses as a police officer to infect the mallories with his joker venom leaving them
