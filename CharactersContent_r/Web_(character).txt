disappearing again 6 it was later revealed that rose was the younger sister of another archie superhero the jaguar 7 reception edit the 60s version of the web with a nagging wife and mother in law was intended to copy the then popular marvel comics style in which superhero characters are seen coping with conflicts in their personal lives 4 this was not well received by fans the mlj companion describes it as a conceit lifted straight out of the day s inane tv situation comedies and dwight r decker wrote in amazing heroes that the web was reduced to playing straight man to mother in law jokes 8 john wells in american comic book chronicles writes that the ongoing nagging of rose raymond was more shrill than funny although that s not to say the feature didn t have its moments 4 later

circle characters included the web 9 the new incarnation of john raymond is a spoiled slacker womanizer fancying himself a socialite his brother david a social worker has distanced himself from his family choosing to help the poorer as a social worker despite their differences john always admired david john was made the heir of the family fortune by his father who reasoned that john s cold privileged mindset would make him a better businessman john who believed his brother to be the better man and rightful heir decided to balance business needs with humanitarian goals to those ends john maintained his profile as a spoiled socialite while using part of his five billion dollar fortune to set up a superpowered persona as the web a common people superhero who derived his name from the world wide web john developed an advanced supercomputer to select the most urgent or worthy of numerous requests for help submitted his website summontheweb com john later discovers that david has fallen in debt to loansharks who later murder david david explains with his last breath that he didn t want to ask john for help because he was too proud david s death causes john to reevaluate his activities as the web and decides that he will no longer aid those who have the resources to help themselves or who have friends and family they can turn to instead the web will assist only those who have no one else to turn to 10 the first beneficiary of his new deal is lieutenant joseph higgins stationed in afghanistan and looking for his missing father however waiting for the web reply higgins is grievously wounded while in a mission and saved by an experimental warsuit by the time the web reviews email and gives him a positive reply higgins has become the shield superhero on his own and a potential ally in john s quest 11 john eventually discovers that the man responsible for david s murder is a renowned scientist named dr archer who is using his knowledge of chemistry to create addictive recreational drugs which he then distributes through violent street gangs unable to hold off archer and fight him actively alone the web resorts like the previous impact comics character to turn the web identity into an organization of equally empowered crime fighters a small army of web hosts receiving functional copies of his suit in exchange for enacting justice in his name 12 13 after a brief period of unrests and anarchy oracle and batgirl offer an upgrade to the web hosts in exchange for them pledging alliance to the justice league of america rather than acting independently and thinning their number to expel the more rambunctious and rebellious members the web hosts now receive their powers from a cloud computing server in the web lair making the web able to shut their suits down remotely furthermore every suit is fitted with an access to twitterati the dcu equivalent of twitter featured into the final crisis dance miniseries granting the host a private social network to use for personal interactions and crimefighting as well and john raymond himself as the current administrator a permanent link to his hosts and simple supporters and a spyware implanted program to gain oracle absolute control over the aptly named interweb with the help of his new hosts and his supporters the web finally tracks down dr archer finally handing him down to the police with enough proof to get him put on trial however alice girlfriend of the late david warns john of another hidden instigator behind archer s actions the mysterious deuces wilde 14 when a technological savvy villain doctor zadar manages to mainline the remote link effectively capturing and controlling the entire web hosts population raymond meets kim brand the current incarnation of the flygirl in this continuity no longer a magic user but a former web host wearing an enhanced illegally modified and souped up web host suit with greater proficiency raymond enlists her for the rescue mission offering her the enhanced suit in exchange this time as her personal property raymond handles the crisis selflessly deliberately risking his life to keep fly girl out of harm but highlighting his lack of teamplay abilities however he manages to impress the u s army to warrant for kim and himself an induction into the newly formed mighty crusaders along with the comet inferno the shield and war eagle 15 powers edit the dc comics incarnation of the web has no superpowers having in his john raymond persona the strength of a man in his prime engaging in moderate physical exercise instead he relies on an overtly technological suit granting him several abilities including but not limited to flight bullet proof armor hud interface connected to a gps tracker and enhanced strength however his most prized asset is his lair similar to the batcave in containing his weaponry and a supercomputer always connected to the website summontheweb com and feeding him the data of people desperate enough to get help from outside sources 12 john raymond has fully functional copies of his suit with every power of his original one used by willing followers of summontheweb com 13 along with an instruction manual and 120 days of tech support creating a super hero franchise named the web hosts obvious pun over the webhost concept consistent with the image of the web as an accessibile internet savvy hero when oracle and batgirl confront him about his lack of control over the hosts john raymond agrees to enforce a stricter charter on his users in exchange for upgrades provided by oracle herself the web hosts are now permanently connected to the interwebs a twitter derived social network fully accessible from the suits that constantly feeds in john raymond s administrator account and suit all information the hosts are willing to share about crime fighting or simple socialization as a programmed side effect however everything the web does is out on the display on the interwebs for everyone to view or comment upon as a security measure the web lair is upgraded with a cloud computing system linked to the hosts making raymond and oracle able to remotely disable the hosts suits 14 jane raymond edit in july 2015 archie comics announced that its imprint dark circle comics would introduce a new version of the web the following year jane raymond a 14 year old korean american high school student who becomes a costumed hero after gaining powers from an accident 16 the announced series never materialized 17 references edit mitchell kurt thomas
