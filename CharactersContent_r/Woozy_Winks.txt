superpower after saving a wizard from drowning he is rewarded via a spell that causes the forces of nature to protect him whenever he is in danger later stories would ignore this ability one story attempted to explain it by saying that the spell wore off after a while and woozy simply became plastic man s inept assistant his personality was based on the comedy of lou costello while his appearance was based on hugh herbert although a comic figure in both appearance and aptitude woozy does have his heroic moments thanks to his own dabbling in illegal activity he can recognize
