heroes edit reintroduced in 1984 the immortal man no longer has super powers beyond his unique reincarnation and is given a revised origin with further detail added in history of the dc universe the flash vol 2 48 and resurrection man 25 27 his reincarnation power is now said to work instantaneously meaning his death now causes him to immediately materialize elsewhere in a new body in the revised origin the immortal man is born roughly 50 000 years ago as klarn 10 leader of the bear tribe 11 klarn is a mortal enemy of vandar adg of the wolf clan their two clans repeatedly fighting during one battle a radioactive meteorite crashes nearby exposure to it makes vandar immortal and invulnerable to injury while evolving his mind after vandar leaves klarn frees a glowing jewel from the meteorite and fashions it into an amulet his mind also evolves and he later realizes he now has a unique form of reincarnation 12 throughout history he fights to protect people from threats and repeatedly interferes with the schemes of vandar adg who adopts the name vandal savage by the 1980s the immortal man is living in the body of a middle aged man of apparent european descent and has amassed great wealth and high tech resources realizing vandal savage has a means to corrupt superman the immortal man attempts to contact the justice league but the team is away on a mission rather than wait he decides to deal with savage s scheme and the mystery behind several strange golden pyramids by creating a team of forgotten heroes recruiting retired and semi retired adventurers including the sea devils cave carson animal man congo bill the time traveler rip hunter dolphin and rick flag of the suicide squad in the end the heroes are triumphant and superman recovers 12 months after this adventure superman and the immortal man s forgotten heroes fight and defeat vandal savage s new team of forgotten villains although the heroes win the immortal man is killed while saving dolphin from an attack by the faceless hunter from saturn once the battle is finished the immortal man appears again now as a young man who appears to be of asian heritage 13 during these 1980s stories the immortal man s other powers do not play a major role in the 1985 1986 crossover crisis on infinite earths the multiverse is threatened and all reality is in peril during the final battles immortal man sacrifices his immortal energies to help save the world and is seemingly unable to return 14 post crisis edit some time after the immortal man s sacrifice during crisis on infinite earths an adolescent girl named steffi jones suddenly gains the immortal man s memories as well as the power of flight she helps the flash against vandal savage and the speedster hero asks if she is the immortal man in a new body steffi says she doesn t think so while she has immortal man s memories and instincts but not his amulet she believes she is a new person and refers to herself as the immortal one no mention is made of stefi s parents or if she was a child found and adopted so it is also unclear if she was already alive before the crisis in which case she could not be immortal man after savage s plan is defeated steffi confronts him and the two are caught in an explosion that seemingly destroys them 15 savage later turns up alive and continues battling earth s superheroes steffi jones is never seen again making it unclear if she died in the blast or was reborn in a new body afterward or was indeed the original immortal man after all in the 1990s the comic series resurrection man reveals that the meteorite that empowered vandar adg and klarn carried tektites a form of nanite based technology these tektites infected the two men to different degrees granting them their unique abilities with immortal man s amulet apparently maintaining his tektite field the meteorite was hurled through time by unknown agents landing in what would become the ardennes forest 1 93 million years ago during the pleistocene era 16 17 in the late 20th century the amnesiac hero mitch shelley begins operating as the resurrection man like immortal man and vandal savage he has tektites in his body that grant him a form of immortality every time he is killed he returns moments or minutes later fully healed and with a different superhuman power the forgotten heroes encounter mitch shelley and believe he may be the immortal man with altered powers trying to jog his memory they talk about an adventure they shared with immortal man soon before the crisis during which the hero had the form of a middle aged man with black hair and white temples encountering vandal savage the villain admits he has fought mitch shelley many times over throughout history but reveals the resurrection man is an entirely separate person from the immortal man to prove it he reveals the real immortal man has been his prisoner since soon after the crisis the immortal man still has the appearance he had before the crisis indicating he did not reincarnate as steffi jones afterward 18 resurrection man vandal savage and the immortal man then join forces against a creature that emerges along with a second tektite meteorite this creature a warp child alters time and erases many of the world s heroes from reality the immortal man melds his tektite field with the creature s own overloading it and destroying them both while restoring history in the process because he overloaded his tektites the source of his immortality it is implied the immortal man is now truly dead 19 dc rebirth edit following the dc rebirth relaunch of dc comics in 2016 a new version of immortal man is introduced in the series immortal men in the new history klarn arg is born in the 47th century bce a member of the bear clan with siblings one night a radioactive meteorite strikes earth and the four siblings investigate alongside vandar adg and the wolf clan the five primitive humans are bathed in strange radiation that evolves their minds and makes them immortal the five form a council of immortals and decide to help humanity but debate the best method to do so three methods debated are through knowledge through harmony or through expression klarn who eventually takes the name immortal man believes in saving humanity through action specifically the action of good people striving to save others his sister kyra who adopts the name infinite woman argues humanity rises best through conquest or when forced to face an enemy 20 over time the council of immortals immortal man infinite woman constant forever child and vandal savage gain many followers forming five different houses the five immortals find they can also share some immortality but not invulnerability with those they choose allowing some followers to remain with them for centuries the immortal man is leader of the house of action based in a place called the campus and his followers sometimes refer to themselves as the immortal men infinite woman leads the house of conquest based in a place called the siege other houses include the house of knowledge the codex the house of expression the masque and the house of harmony the tabernacle each house influences humanity and agrees through official treaties not to interfere with each other the immortal houses use different methods to block the memories of mortals who see them and learn of their secret operations the houses refer to their secret operations and battles as the eternal war to save humanity the house of conquest and house of action often clash 20 in the 21st century the house of conquest breaks the immortal treaties by attacking the house of action the immortal man fearing his sister will succeed in killing him initially plans to transmit his mind into a new recruit a teenage boy named caden park who has the ability to read another s memories mind swipes the plan fails and immortal man seemingly dies caden gains a blood mask device that the immortal man had developed before his death and the computer mistakenly believes the teenager to be the immortal man reborn with this caden can access klarn s database and the memories of his dead followers in retaliation for the house of conquest s actions and to prevent them from achieving victory the immortal men disables the technology keeping their battle unseen forcing the world and the justice league to see evidence of the eternal war 20 other versions edit in final crisis superman beyond 1 superman moves briefly through earth 20 a world protected by the society of super heroes led by doc fate an alternate version of doctor fate and including a version of immortal man 21 writer grant morrison described this particular parallel earth as having the style of a 1940s retro thing explaining why doc fate the immortal man and their allies are drawn in the style of 1930s and 40s pulp magazine heroes 22 in the multiversity the society of super heroes conquerors from the counter world 1 2014 it is revealed that this version of immortal man is actually anthro who in dc comics is often cited to be one of earth s first homo sapiens on earth 20 anthro was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed vandal savage s immortality he and doc fate s society of super heroes are earth 20 s last defense against an invasion by earth 40 an evil counterpart to earth 20 where vandal savage and lady shiva lead an army of villains powers and abilities edit original version edit due to exposure to a unique meteorite first said to be radioactive later revised to be empowered by microscopic technology called tektites klarn the immortal man possesses a reincarnation ability if he dies he soon materializes in a new body elsewhere on earth appearing from nowhere without having to be literally born again as is usually the case with traditional reincarnation each time klarn materializes in a new form an amulet he made from the meteorite materializes with him at the beginning of a new life the immortal man s mind is sometimes clouded and his memories hazy but the amulet quickly works to restore his memories the amulet regulates klarn s mind and reincarnation power by stabilizing his tektite field due to his many lives across thousands of years the immortal man is an excellent tactician skilled in various forms of combat and survival and is knowledgeable in many fields of study his different bodies vary in age appearance and athletic prowess but the immortal man s basic personality remains the same if the immortal man is separated from his amulet then he has greater difficulty recalling the knowledge and skills he s acquired through his lives in his four original 1960s stories the immortal man s amulet also grants him psionic abilities such as pyrokinesis creating and controlling nearby flame limited telepathy allowing animal communication and control over weaker willed minds and limited telekinesis allowing flight and reinforcing his physical strength none of these powers appear again after his reintroduction in 1984 though steffi jones who either inherits his power or is the immortal man in a new form is seen to possess the power of flight during the series resurrection man it was said the immortal man vandal savage and mitch shelley could all sense each other s presence due to their tektites reacting to each other dc rebirth version edit since dc rebirth klarn does not reincarnate into new bodies instead an encounter with a strange meteorite leaves him ageless and invulnerable to harm in this continuity klarn can also share immortality but not his invulnerability meaning those he bestows with power are untouched by age or disease the traditional definition of immortality but can still be killed by physical injury and other outside factors caden park the new immortal man after klarn possesses telepathy while wearing the device known as blood mask caden can access the skills and memories of all fallen immortal men of the house of action in other media edit in the shared arrowverse of the cw network s dctv shows elements of immortal man s story are given to hawkman and hawkgirl as well as rip hunter all of whom are sworn enemies of vandal savage in this version of events references edit cowsill alan irvine alex korte steve manning matt wiacek win wilson sven 2016 the dc comics encyclopedia the definitive
