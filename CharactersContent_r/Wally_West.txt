2009 in dc s main lineup until barry returned in the flash rebirth even so wally is the fastest character to ever hold the mantle of the flash and a fan favorite he would later return as the main flash since 2021 as part of the infinite frontier relaunch in his debut as the flash wally wears a distinct red and gold costume which like his uncle he traditionally stores compressed inside a ring he later creates a costume directly out of speed force energy following his return in 2016 wally is able to easily generate white lightning which means his connection to the speed force is stronger

george pérez wallace rudolph west ii or wally west was created by john broome and carmine infantino and introduced in the flash 110 1959 the character was the nephew of the existing flash character s girlfriend and later wife iris west during a visit to the central city police laboratory where barry allen worked the freak accident that gave allen his powers repeated itself bathing wally in electrically charged chemicals now possessing the same powers as the flash west donned a smaller sized copy of barry allen s flash outfit and became the young crimefighter kid flash wally had a strained relationship with his own parents and often looked to his beloved aunt and uncle for moral support and guidance he also operated as a lone superhero in his hometown blue valley nebraska when not partnering with the flash this costume was later altered in the flash 135 1963 to one that would make him more visually distinctive 2 the original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings gloves and lightning bolt emblem the ear pieces initially remained yellow but became red in later issues in addition to his appearances within the flash title the character was a founding member of the newly created teen titans where he became friends with dick grayson then known as robin later known as nightwing 1 sometime later wally contracted a mysterious illness that affected his entire bodily system the more he used his speed powers the faster his body deteriorated this could have been caused by one of two things wally was a boy when the electrified chemicals altered his body which was still developing and maturing as opposed to barry allen who was already an adult when his accident occurred or when he was struck with a weapon during his time with the teen titans as such as wally s body matured his altered body chemistry was slowly killing him the flash edit during the 1985 1986 miniseries crisis on infinite earths barry gave his life to save the earth when destroying the antimatter cannon that was aimed at earth 3 initially unaware of this wally was coaxed by jay garrick into assisting the heroes against the anti monitor s forces during the final battle with the anti monitor wally was struck by a blast of anti matter energy which cured his disease in the aftermath of the conflict wally took on his fallen mentor s costume and identity 4 the decision by dc comics editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character wally west became the new flash but less powerful than his predecessor 1 for example instead of being able to reach the speed of light he could run just faster than that of sound 4 also the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism 5 those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new flash comic initially written by mike baron these stories focused not only on the flash s superhero exploits but the state of wally s wealth west won a lottery 6 bought a large mansion 7 and began dating beautiful women the character s finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until the flash vol 2 62 when his fortunes stabilized flash vol 2 1 june 1987 wally west holds as first the modern age flash art by jackson guice the 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character with a modified uniform appearing in 1991 8 this modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional flash costume with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a v at the front where allen s costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band removal of the wings from the top of his boots a change in the material of his costume and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl this modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist dave stevens for the live action television series the flash wally west as the flash in his first modernized costume that differentiates from his predecessor s in the flash vol 2 50 march 1991 art by greg larocque a difficult encounter was made with a vicious foe the first reverse flash eobard thawne thawne had been killed by barry allen shortly before allen s death but this version of thawne was from a time period before he originally became allen s enemy also served to increase the speed of the character forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers to prevent himself from truly replacing barry wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor s equal but when thawne arrived in the present and briefly posed as barry allen his bragging that he would become the true flash forced wally past this block as he feared thawne replacing barry more than he feared himself doing so 9 after this encounter he was again barry allen s equal in speed and eventually became even faster though he still had not been able to recover barry s vibrational phasing abilities for a time he could vibrate through objects but this would cause the object to explode he gained several new powers that barry never had he was able to share steal speed use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks and super heal others writer mark waid expanded on the character s powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the speed force an energy source that served as a pseudo scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional speedsters within the dc universe using this concept as a basis the character s ability to tap into the speed force was used to expand his abilities the character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people 10 11 and create a costume directly out of speed force energy traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored because of this the flash felt pressured into having to constantly be heroic 24 7 during this time he joined the justice league the 2000s saw writer geoff johns revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as zoom making significant use of the rogues and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend linda park 12 other changes included restoring the flash to a secret identity his identity had been public since shortly after barry allen s death but the traumatic events of his first battle with zoom prompted wally to make a deal with the spectre to erase his identity from public knowledge although this was initially so successful that even wally forgot he was the flash during the identity crisis crossover wally and kyle rayner learned dr light s mindwipe by the original justice league and the cause of the villain s transformation from a dangerous serial rapist to an ineffectual buffoon when dr light vows revenge against the league wally realizes that the villain is again a powerful threat he then warns the teen titans and outsiders not to underestimate dr light and later joins their fight against him in the miniseries infinite crisis as a narrative device wally west and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality this allowed the character bart allen to become the fourth flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title called the flash the fastest man alive the critical reaction to this new version of the flash was mixed and bart was killed off in the final issue of the short lived third volume 1 it was decided that wally west should return and the jla jsa story the lightning saga was used to return the character to earth along with his wife and children who appear to have aged several years the character next appeared in all flash 1 2007 seeking vengeance on those who had killed bart allen this was followed by the flash vol 2 which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue 231 october 2007 the series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super powered twins plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game a task made more difficult by wally s unemployment his inability to keep a steady job and the mistrust of the league for his decision to bring two children into the fold the series was canceled with issue 247 february 2009 in final crisis the character was reunited with barry allen who had returned to life later in the flash rebirth wally makes modifications on his costume to further differentiate himself from barry due to them sharing the flash identity with jay garrick blackest night edit during the blackest night wally west assists barry allen in spreading the word to every hero on earth about the rise of the black lantern corps when black hand brings back nekron barry is attacked by an army of black lanterns while struggling to fight them off wally comes to his rescue bringing with him the justice league teen titans bart allen the kid flash among them the three flashes fight their way through black lanterns and charge at nekron before they can strike the black lantern guardian scar attacks them attempting to convince them into becoming black lanterns right after hal jordan and the leaders of the seven lantern corps arrive to assist the heroes attack the black lanterns but when black hand reanimates batman s corpse as a black lantern the resulting emotional shock allows the black lantern rings to latch onto the resurrected heroes transforming superman superboy wonder woman green arrow black canary and kid flash into black lanterns black lantern bart allen attacks barry allen and the two brawl for a moment before wally fights him off a pair of black lantern rings then lock onto barry and hal wally flees with barry with barry telling him to stay and protect himself and bart barry and hal then flee the scene to avoid becoming black lanterns return the new 52 and dc rebirth edit following the 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe wally west appears to have never existed a seemingly new interpretation of wally west was introduced in the flash vol 4 annual 3 originally portrayed as the new 52 version of the classic and original character and the biracial son of rudy west this biracial wally renamed wallace west in later comics to avoid confusion was retconned in dc rebirth 1 as being the cousin of wally west and the son of the new 52 reverse flash daniel west both cousins are explained as having been named after their great grandfather the existence of wally west is hinted at in the final issue of titans hunt in which the various original teen titans remember their bond to each other but realise that they are still forgetting an important final member of their team they look out to the ocean as lightning strikes 13 wally west s rebirth costume as the flash is in homage to his previous kid flash and the flash costumes promotional art for dc rebirth by brett booth and norm rapmund wally west is reintroduced to dc continuity a week later in a dc rebirth story the story reveals that following the flashpoint event wally became lost in the speed force for 10 years while trapped he came to realize that barry had not been responsible for the mutation of the new earth universe into prime earth but that an unknown entity had used barry s time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality the fallout of the recent darkseid war allowed wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth each attempt caused him to fall further into the speed force after realizing that not even linda his traditional lightning rod could remember him wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before his uncle barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him just before wally disappeared barry remembered him and dragged him out of the speed force wally s presence integrates his pre flashpoint history to the new timeline to accommodate his existence resetting his past and those who associated with him following a tearful reunion wally gave barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come 14 although the two decide to keep wally s return secret from iris based on wally s own experience with linda barry encourages him to return to the titans but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the flash rather than kid flash 15 16 wally goes to the titans and through both physical contact to nightwing donna troy arsenal tempest and lilith clay with the speed force reminding them of their memories with him creating a new history after an emotional reunion with his friends he tells them of the situation wally believes that the unknown entity will attack again to prevent them from finding out the truth which they will do together as titans 17 directly after the events in titans rebirth lilith has wally repeat the story of his return in order for her to use it as a means of making the mental connections between him herself and the titans stronger while doing this she notices the most powerful thought in wally s mind is that of linda park which sparks various but supportive reactions from the other titans nightwing encourages wally to seek linda out and try and make new memories with her elsewhere linda is still puzzled by wally s sudden presence in her life and decides to investigate him further 18 during a confrontation with abra kadabra wally is forced to push himself so fast that he is sent into the speed force while trying to save her and the other titans from being killed by kadabra 19 but in a conversation with a manifestation of his memories of linda wally is encouraged not to give up on the idea that he can make a new relationship with her in this timeline subsequently using his memories of the titans as a new lightning rod to return to earth 20 afterwards wally is visited by superman who confirms that he like wally remembers the world that existed before history was edited 21 later deathstroke wanted to use the speed force to save his son and takes out wally wallace west and damian wayne managed to save wally but damian wayne had to stop wally west s heart momentarily making wally west have a heart pacer after that adventure while on a mission with the titans wally learned that he has the ability to go fast and stop time as well after a battle against psimon mister twister and the key wally used too much of his abilities and he seemingly dies however kid flash wallace west senses wally s death and rushes to find him after noticing wally west dead kid flash senses that wally is not completely dead and he revives him by jumpstarting his heart curing wally of his pacemaker condition wally west then helps the titans defeat donna troy s evil self from an alternate future troia and the other villains when barry confronts wally about how he has not made any real effort to make contact with iris rebuild things with linda or even try to make a new life for himself wally tries to compensate for this by tracking down frances kane but his initial contact with her also re awakens her old psychological issues causing her to attack wally before he calms her down by confessing his own fears about his current circumstances inspired by this conversation wally calls dick grayson to help him purchase an apartment however wally is unaware that his friend turned foe hunter zolomon has returned now in a position of authority in the 25th century zolomon sends the renegades into the past to arrest iris for the murder of eobard thawne with the intention of provoking a war between the flashes in order to make the true flash stronger through tragedy 22 after the flash family defeated gorilla grodd in a battle wally meets iris for the first time after his disappearance he begins remembering pre flashpoint memories after iris remembers him however a confrontation with his former ally hunter zolomon provokes barry and wally into conflict as hunter convinces wally that the speed force must be destroyed to release those missing allies still trapped within it including wally s children jai and iris west max mercury and impulse wally became determined to break the speed force open in a bid to free them which led to a frantic chase with barry allen trying to stop wally before he did something drastic remembering all too well the damage he himself had done to the time stream attempting to stop his mother s murder during the flashpoint event unfortunately wally proved himself to be the true fastest man alive and was able to outrun barry and create the break he wanted the resulting explosion sent both heroes back to barry s hometown of central city and into the clutches of a gloating zoom who quickly revealed that his true intention in reminding wally about the existence of his children was to trick wally into breaking the force barrier a cosmic barricade that concealed energies that could be tapped into by the right people in much the same way that the speed force empowers speedsters these energies include the sage force seemingly based around telepathic and telekinetic powers and the strength force zoom discovered the existence of these energies reading 25th century history books and determined a way to tap into these energies as well as the speed force once the force barrier was broken he also donned a replica of barry allen s costume declaring himself the one true flash before deciding that he would spare barry and wally the pain of their future lives by ending them now heroes in crisis edit during the heroes in crisis story arc wally was initially believed to be one of the massacre s highest profile victims at the superhero rehabilitation facility known as sanctuary but is later revealed to be not only alive but actually the real culprit of the murders wally explains all in his confession one of the many recorded video transcripts that wally himself sent to lois lane while identifying himself as the puddler that he s felt alone since his return as his family remains wiped from existence with no one even to remember them except him these tortured memories are what led him to sanctuary in the first place but he found no comfort there instead he relates how he still felt alone because he didn t see the same kind of pain in its other residents and the program s anonymity only compounded his feelings of isolation wally therefore did some digging of his own into sanctuary s resident records and uncovered a truth that he had been denying every one of the heroes at sanctuary were in fact coping and trying to overcome their own personal traumas just as wally was uncovering all this information at superspeed led to a flood of emotional experiences that momentarily allowed wally to understand he wasn t so alone after all while this realization might have initially given wally some comfort it all came to him in a comparative instant instead of helping to heal him the onslaught of emotions broke him in turn he momentarily lost control of the powers of the speed force contained within him and in another fateful instant the powers of the speed force were unleashed on the other heroes within sanctuary killing them instantly wally accessing sanctuary s files had tripped the facility s alarm and the moment of wally s breakdown happened harley and booster were immersed in their respective virtual reality therapy sessions taking advantage of that happy coincidence wally used his powers to deliver a superspeed sleight of hand at harley and booster s expense as each exited their vr chambers he reprogrammed them and tricked the pair into thinking they had left the chambers when in fact they had not instead of seeing the actual massacre what each instead saw was the other murdering wally from there wally stole booster s time traveling tech went five days into the future killed his future self and brought his future body back to present day to leave at the scene wally s machinations are what led booster to discover that dead wally s body was five days too old wally then relocated all the bodies of the others he had slain staging the murders to place himself above suspicion and set up harley and booster as the prime suspects instead to complete the subterfuge wally then destroyed sanctuary s computer and robot attendants and scribbled the now infamous the puddlers are all dead on sanctuary s living room wall he successfully misdirected everyone involved in the investigation until ted kord booster gold batgirl and harley quinn figured out that wally was the key to the murders and they devised a way to track wally s time disturbance by utilizing skeets and kord industries tech they show up just as wally is about to kill five days older wally and five days wally reveals that after he accidentally killed everyone in sanctuary he didn t travel back in time to unmake his mistake because that s what barry did during flashpoint instead he sent the confession files to lois lane to try to make up for what happened telling the world what he d done at sanctuary and encouraging people to get help before they made the same mistakes he did five days wally reveals that this is the same thing that happened to him five days ago that he also didn t kill the older wally booster gold explains that they can still close the loop even without the dead body of five days old wally they can go to the 25th century and speed clone older wally then younger wally can take that cloned body back to the past the justice league eventually arrived and arrested wally for the murders in the flash 761 it was revealed that eobard thawne was responsible for manipulating wally into killing the heroes at sanctuary later this whole story was recollected in the flash annual 1 2021 stating that wally west was not responsible for these deaths and it was revealed that speed force itself had actually caused it when trying to expel savitar from its corridors doomsday clock edit in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock lex luthor mentioned to lois lane that someone has been undermining creation like what doctor manhattan did with wally west and the justice society of america 23 when doctor manhattan altered the metaverse and in turn the multiverse and created the new 52 universe wally prior to being freed in dc universe rebirth 1 briefly escaped the speed force to warn doctor manhattan that he knows what the latter did and that the heroes of the dc universe will stop him wally was pulled back into the speed force afterwards 24 flash forward and generation edit wally is later recruited by tempus fuginaut who wants him to restore the balance between the light and dark multiverses after saving several universes from being consumed by dark matter wally finds the mobius chair that once belonged to metron and makes a deal with fuginaut to return his children jai and iris who were trapped in the dark multiverse to his wife linda park but after sitting upon the chair wally in addition to obtaining a cosmic level of knowledge also obtains the powers of doctor manhattan after he put a fraction of his power into the chair wally s costume and lightning proceeded to turn to the blue of manhattan with manhattan s logo forming on his forehead and wally now losing nearly all sense of emotion he had and now seeking logic and knowledge after finding out that doctor manhattan did not completely heal the universe after doomsday clock wally begins using his newfound powers to set about restoring the timeline 25 infinite frontier edit following the 2021 event infinite frontier 0 wally is restored as the primary flash and central character in the flash series since 768 after barry allen s departure to join justice incarnate wally s first storyline in the solo title sees him travel through the timeline as he attempts to prevent a destructive release of something in the speed force which sees him meet his daughter iris in the future as an accomplished flash in the arc s conclusion in the flash annual 2021 wally is thrown back to the moment of his greatest torment the explosion at sanctuary which killed his friends he is unburdened by the revelation that this was not his fault but rather that of the same speed force phenomenon caused by the mad speedster savitar and the speed force s attempts to expel him from its interior with help from mister terrific barry allen green arrow and the past roy harper shortly before he died at sanctuary wally is able to bring savitar back with him to the present although savitar easily overcomes superman and batman barry tells wally to step up making use of his superior bond to the speed force to defeat depower and imprison savitar once again fully redeemed and more powerful than ever wally returns to linda and the kids enthusiastic to serve as central city s flash once again powers and abilities edit wally s primary superpower is his ability to control the speed at which his body vibrates and to move and think at super speed which he uses primarily to run at extreme superhuman velocities his power is originated from his mainline connection to the speed force a vaguely defined extra dimensional and infinite energy source from which most speedster heroes gain their powers wally is widely considered to be the fastest flash and is significantly faster than his mentor barry allen 26 27 28 29 30 31 he has been confirmed to be the fastest being in the entire dc multiverse 25 while most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force wally mainlines power from the speed force itself and cannot be cut off from the source this connection to the speed force grants him unique abilities that other speedsters lack such as lending and taking speed which manifests in different ways ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others metabolisms and healing abilities allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time as well as absorbing kinetic energy in a less direct manner he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet earth while standing at the north pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earthquakes wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure speed force energy 32 like all flashes wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the pressure of compressed air caused by moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities it is not known how wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to sidestep such environmental consequences because of his powers and connection to the speed force he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body it is his connection to the speed force that constantly rejuvenates him while running making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed even so he has a sped up metabolism and finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed using his abilities wally can run at such speed that he can run on water create powerful vortices with his arms or body and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he is vibrating through however wally accidentally destabilizes whatever he passes through causing it to explode while this has its drawbacks wally has learned to use this offensively in battle since rebirth 2016 wally improves this ability and can vibrate through objects without causing them to explode 33 instead of using the cosmic treadmill as his uncle barry wally can use his speed to travel through time in flash 150 he traveled back to the events of crisis on infinite earths and battled the anti monitor speed blitzing him until his shell was destroyed he also outran death to the edge of the universe and beyond where death didn t even exist and continued to run to get linda back there was a comic series titled the human race in which wally ran faster than instant teleportation reaching trans time velocity 34 the flash vol 2 177 had wally outrun the gravitational pull of a black hole using jessie quick s speed formula combined with his speed steal wally can temporally accelerate to the point where he escapes linear time essentially allowing him to function like the chronokinetic zoom wally s connection to the speed force also grants him low to high electrokinetic abilities he generates large amounts of lightning while moving at super speed as well as whenever he is angered on certain occasions wally has been able to project arcs of speed force lightning such as when he is lending speed or when he was using the speed force to restore the memories of the titans during dc rebirth wally can also absorb electrical attacks and rebound them with ten times the force wally west is the fastest flash and is arguably the fastest being that has ever existed as said by max mercury and it has been remarked that wally and barry are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun death itself 11 wally himself has performed several feats and made several references to be faster than barry and having surpassed him 26 wally is fast enough to easily break all the speed barriers and even enter the speed force wally has on several occasions traveled much faster than light and entered and exited the speed force by his own volition he has shown that he can achieve practically any speed he wishes and that there are no limits to his speed wally has even become so fast and so powerful that he became faster than the speed force itself 25 some interpretations of wally are shown as having above average strength on the justice league episode the brave and the bold part 2 the gorilla solovar tells wally that he weighed around 400 lbs wally then proceeded to lift solovar and run to safety wally is also a skilled science prodigy in some versions like young justice wally uses these skills to recreate the accident that gave barry his powers by himself granting himself his own powers like his mentor wally understands what his speed enables him to do and uses his knowledge of physics to his advantage in battle he has extensive knowledge and experience with time travel and the multiverse and was also considered by michael holt aka mister terrific to be one of the smartest people he knew and was given a job as a mechanic engineer at terrifictech after his return to the dc universe wally is said to be even faster than before 28 titans 2016 5 issue established that the speed force is inside wally more than ever before he can generate white lightning which combines all the colors of the speed force 35 also in dc rebirth wally learned that he can sense when time has been manipulated as well as listen to the speed force which allows him to sense disruptions in the space time continuum wally has had some hand to hand combat training and is skilled in judo 36 allies and friends edit wally s father rudolph west 37 a manhunter agent was presumed deceased following an explosion in cuba during the invasion series he reappeared years later at among other places his ex wife mary west s wally s mother second wedding they both later attended wally and linda s wedding while they disagree regularly wally has developed an odd friendship respect with batman who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual like his predecessors west is best friends with the green lantern of his time kyle rayner wally also retained a close friendship with kyle s predecessor hal jordan who often looked out for wally even while he was the spectre his best friend is dick grayson who served with wally on the teen titans as the first robin and served as wally s best man at his wedding the members of the new teen titans the team wally served on as kid flash have reappeared several times throughout his life although they are not always in close contact with one another the team consider each other family wally is no exception supporting cast edit wally has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his comic series that began in 1987 a few are former villains and adversaries such as pied piper speed demon and chunk linda park west wally west s girlfriend and later wife park is a news reporter although she later goes to medical school 38 park is west s lightning rod when travelling in the speed force mary west wally s mother iris west allen
