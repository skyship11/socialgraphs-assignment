as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatreds as well as to be another embodiment of what he called less actively developed men emotionally misaligned who needed emotional reform by a love leader wonder woman william moulton marston s creation of doctor psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism marston a psychologist created doctor psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women the character was partly inspired by actor lon chaney man of a thousand faces and partly by marston s undergraduate advisor hugo münsterberg who was opposed to women s suffrage and feminism and was into metaphysics 3 doctor psycho was also one of several villains created for wonder woman who were occultists beguiling the masses for their own self enriching purposes as wonder woman s rogues and supporting cast were largely jettisoned during the period that robert kanigher wrote and edited the issues doctor psycho remained one of the
