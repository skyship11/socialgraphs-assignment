the legion of super heroes to help them destroy the sun eater threatening earth the emerald empress mano the persuader and validus led by tharok subsequently formed an alliance after it was successfully stopped 3 though they were offered pardons for their assistance the five rejected them and banded together confident that they are powerful enough to try to conquer the worlds they had saved and subsequently clashed with the legion many times 2 a later incarnation consisted of the emerald empress the persuader flare a rimborian with the power of fire caress who had a deadly acidic touch and mentalla a legion reject who was secretly working against the five trying to secure a spot in the legion the first storyline in legionnaires 1993 had the sw6 legion face a fatal five comprising tharok mano the persuader a new emerald empress and a monstrous being called mordecai zero hour edit following the zero hour legion reboot the original fatal five was reintroduced in legion of super heroes vol 4 78 1996 again assembled to help fight the sun eater although it was later revealed that the sun eater did not exist notably in this incarnation the analogue of the emerald empress is simply called the empress and is more a skilled melee combatant than a magic user since this continuity s emerald eye is a sentient being with a will unto itself and a role in other developing storylines in the teen titans legion of super heroes crossover the persuader used his atomic axe to bring fatal five teams from other dimensions forming the fatal five hundred 4 before the two teams are able to use the cosmic treadmill to banish the alternate fatal fives back to their original universes 5 one year later edit the fatal five has not been seen in the threeboot legion setting but in the brave and the bold a version of the team was taken to the present day by the lord of time to assist him in gaining a powerful weapon when his plans were foiled by batman and the blue beetle he abandoned them in the 21st century after batman and tharok were accidentally merged into one being the group was returned to the future where they appear to be already in the legion s prison final crisis edit all five fatal five members were among the supervillains in superman prime s legion of super villains dc rebirth edit in dc rebirth the emerald empress comes to the 21st century to destroy saturn girl only to also fight supergirl to combat supergirl after failing to take her down on her own she forms the 21st century version of the fatal five consisting of magog indigo and the sorceress selena in addition selena strengthens the fatal five by creating a mindless clone of solomon grundy the fatal five then begin their attack on supergirl after breaking indigo supergirl thwarts the emerald empress plot where she fades away to the future causing the people of national city to think that supergirl killed her 6 members edit emerald empress edit main article emerald empress mano edit mano is a mutant born with the power to disintegrate anything that he touches with his right hand with his anti matter touch a native of the polluted world angtu mano must wear an environment suit because he can not breathe the atmosphere of most other planets the suit s helmet obscures his face so that it can only be seen as a silhouette hating his people for mistreating him mano decided to destroy them all by touching the ground and straining his power to the utmost he obliterated his planet causing it to explode considered one of the worst murderers in the galaxy mano was recruited by the legion themselves to help defeat the sun eater after which he continued his criminal career mainly as a member of the fatal five 2 persuader nyeun chun ti edit the persuader came from a heavy gravity planet as a result all of his physical capabilities such as strength and endurance are greatly enhanced before becoming a supervillain he was a gangland enforcer who gained his name from his ability to thoroughly intimidate his victims 7 the persuader wields an atomic axe on a long shaft resembling a halberd this axe could reportedly cut through anything occasionally including purely metaphoric or intangible things such as a person s air supply the force of gravity or the separation between dimensions and followed the persuader s mental commands 8 tharok edit tharok is the leader of the fatal five 9 10 tharok is a small time crook who tries to impress his bosses by stealing a small nuclear device it detonates unexpectedly when the local police fire on him vaporizing one half of his body 11 the people of his world holding life sacred rebuild him using robotic parts this boosts his intelligence dramatically but leaves his evil tendencies unchecked in his early appearances he wore clothing that only covered the organic half of his body tharok s cyborg brain also allows him to control validus the mindless monster member of the fatal five 2 one of the fatal five s main attempts to defeat the legion is masterminded by the dark man the being who organized several teenage refugees from the planet dryad into the league of super assassins 12 during this time period it is revealed that the dark man is actually a clone of tharok grown from tissue removed from tharok s body during his cyborg reconstruction when the scheme to destroy the legion fails both tharok and the dark man are seemingly destroyed 13 and the fatal five eventually disband 14 post zero hour edit following the zero hour legion reboot tharok is introduced in legionnaires 34 february 1996 in this version he stole a powerful solvent rather than a nuclear device and when the police shot at him the container was punctured the solvent severed every molecular bond on the left hand side of his body a brilliant surgeon rebuilt him as a cyborg and an ungrateful tharok then killed him tharok later upgrades his robot half giving it more built in weaponry post infinite crisis edit in the aftermath of the infinite crisis miniseries most of the legion s original continuity has been restored the restoration of the original continuity was confirmed in the lightning saga and the superman and the legion of super heroes story arcs tharok alongside the other fatal five members was among the supervillains in participating in a massive assault on the legion by superboy prime and the legion of super villains 15 thus it is unclear if tharok has encountered the dark man in current dc continuity or if the dark man even exists at all powers and abilities edit in the pre infinite crisis continuity the entire left hand side of tharok s body is mechanical it possesses great strength and durability and the arm can be configured into various weapon forms it also has a cybernetic brain that is connected to tharok s own giving him genius level intelligence in the current continuity tharok s upper body is wholly humanoid while below his waist he has a robotic carriage on wheels validus edit in the latter half of the 30th century an entity known as the sun eater threatened to consume earth s sun thus destroying the solar system 16 desperate to stop the sun eater s efforts superboy and the legion of super heroes recruited the aid of the fatal five they discovered that validus was among their ranks but had no idea of his true parental heritage the fatal five reluctantly agreed to help the legion and the sun eater s efforts were averted validus remained a loyal member of the fatal five always ready to do tharok s bidding 2 during one memorable altercation with the legion validus killed lyle norg the original invisible kid it was later revealed that validus origin supposedly stemmed from a diabolical plot by a powerful legion foe 17 as revenge for his defeat in the great darkness saga darkseid kidnapped one of the identical twin children of lightning lad and saturn girl at birth he then sent the newborn back in time cursed with a monstrous body and near mindlessness that made him easily controlled by the likes of the emerald empress with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other years later validus fell under darkseid s influence yet again he manipulated validus against lightning lad placing him in a situation where the legionnaire would be forced to kill him to save the life of his other son graym thanks to the efforts of saturn girl however the plot was averted and both parents discovered that validus was their child soon after validus reverted to his normal human condition his parents soon renamed him garridan during the five years later era chronicled in legion of super heroes vol 4 it was revealed that darkseid s tampering with garridan s body chemistry had spawned a new virus which brainiac 5 dubbed the validus plague only natives of winath and titan the homeworlds of garridan s parents were susceptible to the disease but for them it was fatal as a result garridan was forced to wear a containment suit allowing him mobility yet keeping him in perpetual medical quarantine his replacement in the reformed fatal five was a similar enigmatic behemoth named mordecai by leland mccauley iv after the events of the zero hour miniseries legion continuity was rebooted entirely and validus origin was changed considerably he was no longer the child of lightning lad and saturn girl darkseid had nothing to do with his creation and he was also significantly weaker in the threeboot continuity validus was the name of a nature spirit in the folklore of the planet of winath known as the lord of lightning mekt ranzz was a member of a cult that worshipped him since the ranzzes gained their powers and left the planet the cult has grown considerably seemingly granting everyone on winath lightning powers this was later revealed as the product of nanomachines in their blood the cover of justice league of america vol 2 13 depicts validus as a member of the latest incarnation of the injustice league however in the actual story contents of the same issue he does not appear alongside the other fatal five members validus was among the villains in superboy prime s legion of super villains 18 garridan ranzz along with his twin brother graym was recently depicted as a young child living with saturn girl and lightning lad 19 thus it appears that validus and garridan are not the same being in current continuity or that this validus is from a different moment in time powers and abilities edit the classic validus possessed tremendous superhuman strength enabling him to easily overpower even the silver age superboy in fact on one occasion it took the combined strength of kryptonian level heroes superboy mon el and ultra boy just to knock him down and on another superboy estimated that validus possessed 12 times his strength validus was shown to be strong enough to tear an entire planet apart with his bare hands in addition validus could fire energy bolts from his brain that were powerful enough to incapacitate a kryptonian or daxamite with a single hit he was extremely resistant to all forms of harm and sometimes seemed not even to notice super powered attacks against him by members of the legion he was able to fend off even the sun eater in order to rescue princess projectra showing that he was not innately evil he was also capable of flight through space and was immune to telepathy his first appearance did define some limitations to his power he could be held in a cell with thick inertron walls and it was believed that he could be executed with a bombardment of anti energy although that was not demonstrated depictions of validus strength and intelligence were not consistent over time toys edit in 2007 validus was released as part of the legion of superheroes happy meal toy set by mcdonald s validus was the collect and connect figure for the fifteenth wave of the dc universe classics line other versions edit a version of the fatal five appeared in tangent comics where the team is composed of the tangent comics versions of ice the shadow thief kid psycho deathstroke and count viper they next appear in a flashback in the tangent superman s reign miniseries 2008 in which they are shown to have slaughtered the second atom this version of the fatal five exist on earth 97 of the old multiverse which has been reborn as earth 9 of the new multiverse in other media edit the fatal five made their first television appearance in the justice league unlimited episode far from home with cara kesh version of emerald empress voiced by joanne whalley tharok by tomas arana persuader by an uncredited kin shriner and mano and validus having no dialogue the fatal five consisting of the original five members although both emerald empress and tharok act as leaders is one of the main villain teams on the legion of super heroes animated series with the sarya version of emerald empress voiced by jennifer hale in season one and tara strong in season two tharok by david lodge persuader by david sobolov and mano and validus having no dialogue the group appears in four episodes in season one it is unclear when and how the group assembled in this continuity the sun eater storyline is adapted into the first season finale but the fatal five are the villains fought in the series premiere the fatal five were released by imperiex alongside the legion of super villains from their prison though the group disbanded when validus was taken by imperiex while the emerald empress was rendered powerless by matter eater lad and abandoned by her remaining teammates both validus and persuader were later seen operating alone albeit under the aegis of imperiex the fatal five appear in the dc universe original movie justice league vs the fatal five the team s line up includes emerald empress voiced by sumalee montano tharok peter jessop mano philip anthony rodriguez persuader matthew yang king and validus 20 21 tharok
