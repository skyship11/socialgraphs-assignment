edit the losers are an elite black ops team of united states special forces operatives that includes leader clay roque pooch jensen and cougar who are sent to bolivia on a search and destroy mission on a compound run by a drug lord while painting a target for an upcoming air strike the losers spot slave children in the compound and try to call off the attack but their superior codenamed max ignores their pleas out of options the losers enter the compound successfully rescuing the children and killing the drug lord as a helicopter arrives to pick them up max convinced that they know too much orders it to be destroyed unaware that they decided to rescue the children first the losers watch as a missile destroys the helicopter killing 25 innocents knowing that the attack was meant to kill them they fake their deaths and become stranded in bolivia lacking the funds and paperwork necessary to go home four months later clay is approached by aisha a mysterious woman who offers him the chance to kill max against whom she wants revenge clay accepts and aisha arranges for the group to return to the united states in miami they proceed to attack a convoy supposedly carrying max only to discover aisha has tricked them into stealing a hard drive with max s secrets jensen infiltrates the company that made the drive and steals an algorithm that allows him to access the files discovering that the drive contains credits for a 400 million transfer in max s name which he received for selling snukes or sonic nukes eco friendly bombs that use sonic waves to destroy an area the same size a nuclear warhead can with no fall out to international terrorists tracing the money flow to the los angeles international port of entry which the losers deduce is max s base they form a plan to attack it and kill max while studying the drive jensen discovers that their mission in bolivia was a cover so max could eliminate the drug lord who had discovered his plan and that aisha is the man s daughter seeking revenge for his death after her cover is blown aisha shoots jensen in the arm and escapes believing that she might betray them the losers decide to speed up their attack on max s base only to be betrayed by roque and captured by max and his right hand man and chief of security wade aisha returns and ambushes max s team to rescue the losers despite clay confirming during the fight that he killed aisha s father roque steals max s plane loaded with his money and tries to escape pursued by wade on a motorcycle cougar shoots the motorcycle s engine causing a chain reaction that destroys the plane killing wade and roque max then kills the scientist responsible for the snukes development after revealing that his true intention is to use the snukes to spark global conflict to gain power as jensen cougar and aisha help pooch who has been shot in both legs by one of max s security guards clay pursues max to a crane where max says that he has activated a snuke that will destroy los angeles and clay will have to choose between de activating it or killing max clay chooses the former and max escapes but clay affirms that he now knows what max looks like and will soon find him max escapes on a bus and is robbed by two thugs his fate after this is unknown meanwhile the losers help pooch reach the hospital where his pregnant wife is giving birth to their son and attend jensen s 8 year old niece s soccer game cast edit from top to bottom jeffrey dean morgan zoe saldana idris elba and chris evans jeffrey dean morgan as lieutenant colonel franklin clay a special forces colonel and the de facto leader of the group morgan who starred in the superhero mystery film watchmen 2009 felt that playing clay was far less complicated in comparison to his watchmen role as comedian because of the radically different approach morgan stated that it gave him more freedom and allowed him to be more playful with his character this guy has a real actually much better sense of humor than the comedian did said morgan he s not nihilistic it s completely different this is much lighter a much lighter load for me there s also kind of room for me to interpret this as a project where in watchmen you had to look i was playing the comedian in the most revered comic book ever written i was confined to that in this i could fine tune a lot of what i thought frank clay is and get to play with it a lot more 5 idris elba as captain william roque an expert in detonating and deactivating explosives he is also an expert in knife combat elba previously worked with joel silver in multiple films and opined that his ties with silver helped him sustain a role in the film sylvain white the director is someone i ve known in the industry and he said to me i ve got this thing i m working on and a few directors had looked at the script and were going to make it but sylvain landed it 6 zoe saldana as aisha al fadhil a native bolivian woman offers assistance in locating max in preparation for the role saldana participated in extensive weapons and physical training the actress was required to gain a couple of pounds as she was expected to carry weapons around for eight hours a day 7 saldana summated al fadhil as a manipulative and mysterious individual she s a snake you don t really know what she s hiding up her sleeve she definitely had her own prerogative and it s very meaningful for her she s trying her best to play her cards right but jeffrey s character just gets to her there s just something about him that she s unable to kind of to fill her task her mission 7 chris evans as captain jake jensen the team s intelligence specialist and computer hacker evans professed that portraying the character was considerably different from his previous roles he s just a fun guy you know he s kind of the comic relief evans stated he loves life he s a little nerdy he s not very smooth he s not only a fun character because of the energy you get to infuse it with but who he is it s kind of against type i don t really get to play guys who are awkward and uncomfortable at times in certain situations so it s fun to play him 8 columbus short as sergeant linwood pooch porteous a member who is a specialist in heavy weapons and transportation he refers to himself sometimes in third person while speaking óscar jaenada as sergeant carlos cougar alvarez the group s sniper he is precise in long range eliminations and he speaks rarely throughout the film jason patric as max a corrupt high ranking government official and arms dealer holt mccallany as wade travis max s right hand man and aide peter macdissi as vikram peter francis james as fadhil the bolivian drug dealer and terrorist he is also aisha s father tanee mccall as jolene pooch s wife production edit development edit tim story was initially announced as the film s director in 2007 the losers was thought to be a notable departure from story s previous work as he spent considerable time directing the american superhero films fantastic four 2005 and fantastic four rise of the silver surfer 2007 9 an ardent fan of the war film genre story sought influences from the war drama black hawk down 2001 and the television miniseries band of brothers 2001 i was looking for a vehicle that would have that edge he affirmed but i didn t want to lose my personality which is a bit tongue in cheek where the characters have a little fun with each other 9 coinciding with story s arrival peter berg was declared as a producer for the losers berg was originally responsible for conceiving the film s script ultimately having intentions to direct the film but later left the project to direct hancock 2008 9 alongside akiva goldsman and kerry foster berg collaborated with longtime partners sarah aubrey and john cameron 9 sylvain white replaced story as director in october 2008 10 prior to the revelation white was developing an adaptation of rōnin 11 a native of paris france white asserted that his fascination of the losers became evident after drawing parallels to the graphic novels he read as a child 12 what appealed to me about the losers was that it wasn t the typical superhero with superpowers thing it was based on real characters realistic characters and based in reality like a lot of the european graphic novels that i had grown up reading 12 jock and andy diggle the creators of the vertigo comics of the same name worked closely with white creating for the losers the former in particular was sought after by white for help from the beginning even when i was working on the screenplay i had a really tight dialogue with them even in trying to visualize some of the scenes i would talk to jock often because he s obviously got an amazing eye and they came down during production i m actually talking to them almost every day right now talking to jock in terms of design we included some of his design work into the design of the movie i m not going to give it away but it s certain little design elements that we use to introduce the characters or transition from one location to the next 12 the film adapts the first two volumes of the comic book ante up 13 and double down 14 and tells the story in a more linear way than in the comic books elements of the story have been left out instead of trying to squeeze the whole story into one film and the director would like to tell the rest of the story if the film does well at the box office 15 in february 2009 it was reported that jeffrey dean morgan would headline the upcoming adaptation playing clay in march 2009 it was confirmed that columbus short will play pooch idris elba will play roque and zoe saldana will play aisha chris evans playing jensen and óscar jaenada playing cougar in august 2009 it was announced that jason patric will play max 16 the release date for the losers was changed on two occasions it was originally delayed to june 2010 as it roughly coincided with the release of clash of the titans 2010 ultimately reverting to an april release this occurrence was partially attributed to investment purposes as well as to accommodate reshoots for the film although reshoots were not needed for the film so i think the marketing department decided let s maybe move to the june date but then the april date opened up again and they went back to it i m not quite sure how the science of these things work that s not really my department and i trust the marketing at warner bros to make the best decision for the movie 12 filming edit principal photography commenced over a period of four months from july to october 2009 despite the diverse array of settings featured in the film which included cities such as miami dubai mumbai and los angeles most of principal photography transpired in puerto rico 17 white found its infrastructure and locales to be ideal and convenient giving them the ability to cheat because they had a variety of terrains within a relatively small distance 17 it was staggering what we found when we came to puerto rico to scout recalled foster there is a city obviously gorgeous beaches a close approximation of a desert and a rainforest that was ideal to double for bolivia 17 filming locations in the area include the arecibo observatory s tropical environment which film s peter scrietta felt that producers used to their advantage 17 color was strongly emphasized in crafting the visuals of the film production designer aaron osbourne attempted to enhance the color scheme of the comics which he noticed that only two to three colors were used to convey the tone of each setting every chapter of the comic books is a new environment distinguished by different color palettes explained white i really wanted to do that in the movie as well where every time we are in a new city or country the aesthetic of the film changes completely so there is no homogeneous look it s very eclectic 17 this meticulous approach was echoed by cinematographer scott kevan who white collaborated with in breaking down the images of various scenes we charted the whole movie with certain color schemes for each location and different shades as we moved from day to night 17 marketing edit promotional artwork for the film was released at comic con the poster was drawn in the style of the comic book by series artist jock and was later recreated photographically with the cast from the film and used as the theatrical release poster 18 a four minute preview of the film was shown at wondercon 19 a special double volume collected edition graphic novel was released to tie in with the film adaptation collecting including the volumes ante up and double down a second book to collect the rest of the series was also released 20 release edit in june 2009 warner bros set a tentative release date of april 9 2010 for the film 21 the release date was then pushed back to june 4 2010 to avoid going up against clash of the titans also from warner bros 22 the trailer for the film was released online january 29 2010 and was shown in theaters with edge of darkness 23 an official photo for the film was released online 24 the release date was subsequently moved up to april 23 2010 25 26 reception edit critical response edit the film received mixed reviews on rotten tomatoes the film has a rotten 48 rating with an average score of 5 20 10 based on 167 reviews the critical consensus reads the losers is loud fast and unrelentingly violent but it s also funny and well acted which will make all the difference for some action fans 27 on metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 44 100 based on reviews from 32 critics 28 audiences surveyed by cinemascore gave the film a grade b on scale of a to f 29 peter debruge of variety criticized the film as the sort of pyro heavy exercise parodied in tropic thunder he noted that casting against type helps make the team more memorable but complained that despite the polished production the film offers only a hollow junk food high 30 john anderson described the film as a good idea pushed to excess and with all the freshness of last week s salad bar 31 scott tobias of the a v club complained about the lack of humility or self deprecation in the heroes despite their title he noted how the film tries so strenuously to be cool and described the film as nothing more than style for its own sake 32 kyle smith of the new york post lambasted the film giving it half a star out of 4 he described zoe saldana as a femme banale saying actors jeffrey dean morgan and idris elba deserved better he described the film as one that tries to do so little and yet falls so short 33 phelim o neill of the guardian gave the film 3 stars out of 5 he noted similarities to the a team and criticized the film for being full of action movie cliches he praised the film for the lighter comedic touches and described it as big dumb fun overall 34 his colleague philip french of the observer described the film as being in a team territory with the action sequences being well enough put together but that it was all done far better in walter hill s extreme prejudice 35 director quentin tarantino offered a positive reaction to the film calling it dumb fun 36 box office edit the film played in 2 936 theaters and earned 9 406 348 on its opening weekend at the box office at 4 37 4 the film went on to earn 23 5 million in the
