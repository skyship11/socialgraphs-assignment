history edit ace the bat hound s first appearance in batman 92 july 1955 art by win mortimer and ira schnapp ace debuted in batman 92 july 1955 and was created by writer bill finger and artist sheldon moldoff 2 ace s introduction followed on krypto the superdog s debut in adventure comics 210 march 1955 3 and by german shepherd dogs from detective films and serials such as rin tin tin and ace the wonder dog ace along with batwoman batgirl and bat mite retired from the comic in 1964 when editor julius schwartz instituted a new look batman that shed some of the sillier elements in the series 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit ace was a german shepherd dog originally owned by an engraver named john wilker he was found by batman and robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters 5 batman used ace to try to locate wilker because he had already placed a large number of lost dog announcements for ace in his civilian identity of bruce wayne he was concerned that anyone recognizing ace who had a prominent star shaped marking on his forehead might make the connection between bruce wayne and batman to forestall that problem he hastily improvised a hood like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat emblem as a dog tag dangling from ace s collar 6 ace was subsequently christened the bat hound by a criminal that the dog helped batman to apprehend 7 wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of ace so he left the dog to bruce wayne 8 wilker was never aware that ace was the bat hound or that bruce wayne was batman an early case involved ace tracking down a mentally unhinged ancient weapons expert who was using his own weapons to commit crimes 9 at one point ace acquired superpowers thanks to bat mite but this was short lived 10 he did have his own training for example his specialized radio collar when activated told him to don his own mask via a hands free device and track down batman and robin 11 ace was used less and less over time and for various reasons when bruce was overcome with night terrors robin suggested that ace sleep beside him 12 ace disappeared from the batman comics after julius schwartz took over as editor in 1964 his last appearance was a cameo in a story where batman had lost his fighting spirit 13 post crisis edit batman 462 by alan grant and norm breyfogle a homicide leads batman to san francisco ruby valley and the first appearance of the post crisis ace a version of ace is seen in the cosmic realm of limbo when the hero animal man takes a trip through it 14 a post crisis version of ace was reintroduced in batman 462 june 1991 by the late alan grant and the late norm breyfogle although he has been rarely seen in recent years this version was originally a guide dog belonging to a blind native american named black wolf who called him dog the dog assisted batman in fighting criminals from black wolf s tribe following black wolf s death batman adopted dog renaming him ace he did not wear a mask nor was he ever referred to as bat hound and has the appearance of an english mastiff with a bat shaped dark patch on his flank ace has at times helped batman on cases 15 and is depicted to be very affectionate towards his owner and vice versa after batman is disabled by the villain bane azrael takes over the identity and ejects ace nightwing robin and harold allnut from the batcaves harold a trusted confidante of batman takes in ace they live in a part of the caverns that azrael is unfamiliar with 16 to keep busy ace enjoys playing with a robotic mouse built by harold 17 ace disappeared without explanation after the events of the no man s land storyline in the late 1990s he cameos in ambush bug year none a traditional ace was seen in final crisis superman beyond 3d he is in limbo with other forgotten characters such as gunfire geist hardhat of the demolition team and merryman of the inferior five merryman explains that everyone is here where no stories exist because nobody is writing about them despite this superman and his allies work to rescue all the residents of limbo who then assist in the battle against the cosmic threat of mandrakk 18 the original ace appeared in a flashback scene in batman inc 4 thus making the current canon status of the post crisis ace unclear in this story ace is trying to play with robin who is fuming over kathy kane a k a batwoman and her influence on batman 19 the new 52 edit in batman and robin vol 1 born to kill as part of the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe bruce is seen purchasing a black
