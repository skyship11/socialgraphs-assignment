aforementioned dc comics presents 35 july 1981 4 the intelligence bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act and in at least one instance he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister and shared his insights with the local police at some point after this bobo was employed by the bureau of amplified animals it is not known how he left or even if the bureau still exists 5 after the death of fred thorpe he began to work by himself initially he did quite well as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty during this successful period he was visited by another detective john jones actually the martian manhunter during the jlape crisis who thought bobo s agency seemed to be doing better than his own 6 however as an ape without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person he could not enforce unpaid bills when the public began to forget him he became an alcoholic never leaving the other dimensional oblivion bar which changed management twice during his

the level of agility and physical strength that comes with being a chimpanzee with human knowledge of movement and tools he is capable of conversing with all animals regardless of origin in their own language including all spoken and written human languages he is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world with detective skills rivaling those of ralph dibny and batman bobo has an intelligence quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult human population as evidenced by his mensa membership and his ability to decode the voynich manuscript which remained unsolved for over five hundred years 16 detective chimp s hyper intelligence has shown to have its downsides however as he has claimed it is difficult for him to concentrate without the help of alcohol to focus his mind for a brief time detective chimp also had additional sense expanding powers granted him by the helmet of doctor fate because a chimpanzee s muscles are much denser than a human s detective chimp is unable to swim recent scientific evidence suggests that chimpanzees can swim and this represents a continuity error or detective chimp simply never learned to swim other
