went on to found the second legion of substitute heroes alongside reservists cosmic boy and night girl in the post zero hour continuity chuck was identified as charles foster taine and acted as the legion s resident architect and engineer he did not possess bouncing powers in this continuity and was only an honorary member of the legion as a maintenance man he once built a specialty vehicle called the bouncing boy which acted as a bouncing juggernaut smashing everything in its way 1 the name charles foster taine is a reference to the classic 1941 feature film citizen kane and its title character charles foster kane though in his initial appearance he is simply named chuck taine original research he has yet to appear in the threeboot version of the legion which began in 2004 the post infinite crisis version of bouncing boy appeared in final crisis legion of 3 worlds missing in action during most of the miniseries he and his wife now known as duplicate damsel finally make an appearance in the final issue to help end the battle against the antagonists and then rejoin the legion reboot earth 247 edit on earth 247 chuck taine never gained super powers but was a valuable ally of the legion his parents had been killed by daxamite terrorists during an attack on earth and with their life insurance money he was able to put himself through school to become an architect he designed and helped rebuild the legion headquarters after it took damage from chronos at one point chuck helped repel protean invaders and was around the legion full time repairing brainiac five s laboratory and other structural damage he became close friends with fellow legion staffer tenzil kem had a crush on triad and once went on a friendly date with shrinking violet chuck remained on the legion staff and eventually designed the legion outpost an orbiting space station retroboot new earth edit infinite crisis restored a close analogue of the original legion to continuity shortly after the magic wars chuck is once more an instructor alongside his wife luornu at the legion academy and a legion reservist after his wife s second body was killed this time she developed the power to duplicate an unlimited number of copies of herself they discovered this ability while the taines were on their third honeymoon and then quickly came running when the team sent out a distress call for help against superboy prime and his legion of super villains bouncing boy is currently helping to train the next class of students at legion academy in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock bouncing boy is among the legion of super heroes members that appear in the present after doctor manhattan undid the experiment that erased the legion of super heroes and the justice society of america 8 notable story arcs edit when the legion was disbanded following the blight invasion of earth chuck stayed with a small team of covert legionnaires led by cosmic boy with the legion s benefactor r j brande chuck helped with the construction of a new secret headquarters known as legion world chuck was given an honorary membership and built a ship called the bouncing boy that could ram other objects without taking structural damage chuck was given the job of chief engineer of legion world and worked frequently with the cyborg legionnaire gear he was originally seen as being sent into the time stream with the rest of the legion shortly before earth 247 was destroyed but didn t re surface during the legion of three worlds event chuck may then have been wiped from continuity powers and abilities edit bouncing boy has the ability to expand his body into a spherical form which provides him with bouncing capabilities in this normal form bouncing boy is overweight but when he inflates his mass and height remain the same size while these overall dimensions increase into resembling that of a human sized ball whether his body actually inflates as in takes in air or his individual cells expand which decreases his overall density cannot be explained when he utilizes his own body it becomes extremely rubbery and elastic allowing him to bounce off surfaces with great force originally thought of as a useless power by his legionnaire peers he have demonstrated many times that he can use its shape and rubber like consistency as an effective ballistic weapon his go to move was to ricochet back and forth up on surrounding walls even when bowling over the opponents this also provides him with a limited degree of invulnerability and resistant to electric shocks unlike an inanimate rubber ball that will slowly lose its kinetic energy due to friction and gravity bouncing boy maintains his velocity as he bounces about 9 bouncing boy lost his powers for a short period of time after he accidentally bounced into the matter shrinking facility this caused chuck to lose them which resulted in him being stepped down from the legion of super heroes he later regained these abilities after the original formula was recreated for him 10 he then rejoined the team eight years later he lost his powers again for no apparent reason 11 he resigned once more and married duo damsel 12 he again regained these abilities 13 chuck taine of earth 247 has no powers but is a gifted engineer and architect he built and pilots his own spaceship known as the bouncing boy 14
