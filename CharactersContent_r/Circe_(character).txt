which continued throughout the 1960 s her hair was colored black and her gown pale pink and she was depicted using a scepter to channel her magical powers she was presented as a precarious ally of superman and supergirl although one who occasionally lapsed into full villainy she figured significantly in the origin and exploits of comet the super horse a human turned animal character who was somewhat alarmingly presented as both a love interest for supergirl as well as her pet and steed circe also expressed an unrequited romantic interest in superman which sometimes led her to rash and dangerous plots she would reappear as an unambiguous villain this time in a green gown in 1972 s justice league of america 102 bronze age edit the bronze age circe in wonder woman 313 march 1984 art

go on to reappear in 1985 s who s who in the dc universe as well as crisis on infinite earths the 12 issue limited series that rebooted dc comics continuity modern age edit post crisis edit the modern age circe in her second post crisis look on the cover of wonder woman vol 2 89 june 1994 art by brian bolland circe would be re imagined in june 1988 3 by creative team george pérez and greg potter as part of their reboot of the wonder woman mythos this version with red irises dark violet hair and attired in a sultry green gown would become one of wonder woman s principal post crisis foes with the goddess of witchcraft hecate as her patron circe featured significantly in a number of wonder woman related storylines throughout the modern age including as the principal antagonist in dc comic s 1991 company wide crossover event war of the gods her look would be updated by illustrator john ross in 1994 s wonder woman vol 2 88 lightening her hair to lavender and outfitting her in a revealing green bodysuit ross s redesign accompanied a brassier wise cracking characterization by christopher priest which would be largely retained by future wonder woman writers including phil jimenez gail simone allan heinberg and greg rucka the ross priest version of circe had staying power and with some design detours remained the character s central formulation until dc comics 2011 continuity reboot the new 52 the new 52 and dc rebirth edit the post rebirth circe in justice league dark wonder woman 1 october 2018 art by jesús merino the new 52 circe was introduced in 2011 s men of war vol 2 2 as a stoic nude temptress with blood red hair and chalk white skin written by ivan brandon and illustrated by tom derenick going forward circe s visual depiction would vary somewhat throughout the new 52 and into the subsequent dc rebirth continuity reboot derenick s white skinned circe was refined for 2016 s trinity monthly series adding actual clothes a black corset and red skirt and red braids however this depiction proved to be a deceptive glamour as the post rebirth circe apparently revealed her true countenance in 2016 s wonder woman vol 5 20 in a story written by greg rucka and illustrated by bilquis evely in a surprising visual turn for the character rucka and evely style circe in contemporary clothes with a lesbian chic aesthetic the short cropped auburn red hair of the character s bronze age design returns accompanied by a wardrobe of fitted blazers sharp open collared shirts and black jeans rucka also restores circe s irreverent wise cracking sense of humor and obliquely suggests that the character may not be heterosexual fictional character biography edit pre crisis on infinite earths edit in the original dc comics continuity prior to the crisis on infinite earths circe is a centuries old enchantress who is kept young by an elixir called vitae it is made from a special combination of plants and herbs while living on the island aeaea circe gains magical

space where she could do no harm upon her return to earth circe tries to destroy wonder woman having heard from an oracle in ancient times that the daughter of hippolyta will be her undoing unlike many of wonder woman s other golden age foes circe does not repent when her plot fails and a legendary enmity is born 5 6 in captain marvel adventures 66 set on earth s it is revealed the evil immortal oggar gave circe immortality 3 000 years ago when she was a beautiful graecian princess hoping she would marry him 7 but because he did not give her eternal youth she keeps aging and becomes ugly meaning she hates men who now have a hatred of her face and learns magic to turn them into animals captain marvel and oggar battle on her island and she turns billy into a goat before turning him back she finally helps captain marvel defeat oggar by turning him into a boar he jumps into a bluff and apparently dies meaning she finally dies happily as his spell wears off a woman claiming to be a descendant of the original circe later appears and gives superman an evolution serum which temporarily transforms him into a partial lion after he does not agree to marry her she leaves the planet by the time superman returns to her island realizing the serum contains kryptonite superman theorizes the original circe may have been from krypton 8 6 in ancient times circe is responsible for changing

to prevent an oracular prophecy of circe s death at wonder woman s hands from coming true after she failed to kill the amazon with a series of attacks by man animal hybrids she took up with the aztec god tezcatlipoca who set in motion a chain of events that led wonder woman to the jungles of tropidor circe called on the god to send lightning down to kill wonder woman who deflected the lightning bolts away from her and incinerated the herbs that made circe immortal thus fulfilling the prophecy circe then disappeared swallowed up by tezcatlipoca s magic obsidian mirror which the god used to torture her with an image of herself as a crone circe begins to age normally and is last seen aiding a group of sorcerers who are trying to defeat the anti monitor 16 17 post crisis on infinite earths edit following crisis on infinite earths wonder woman and superman are rebooted all of circe s prior continuity is erased and she is reintroduced with a revamped history greek mythology background edit circe is the daughter of the titans hyperion and perseis circe is a powerful witch and former princess of colchis a beautiful violet haired red eyed sorceress she is known for turning people into animals which are called bestiamorphs as well as for powers of mind control circe has been a devoted follower of the goddess hecate for thousands of years she has lived on the island of aeaea where she became a powerful being in both magic and in influence over portions of man s world during his adventure to her island circe fell in love with odysseus and bore him three sons agrius latinus and telegonus though circe s patron goddess hecate was an offspring of the titans she was not considered one of the main twelve olympians zeus gave hecate much respect but she did not hold much favor with others on olympus as such she married the god hades but their marriage did not last and hecate was demoted as handmaiden to her former husband s new wife because of this she left the realm of the gods and agreed to render her soul to her most devoted servant circe this caused circe to attain her current goddess level of power and immortality 18 beginning of relationship with wonder woman edit when hecate transferred her soul to circe she said the words upon the death of witch and the birth of witch hecate by name and choice shall repossess her soul in addition to being goddess of witchcraft hecate is also a goddess of the moon when circe learned that wonder woman shared her name with moon goddess diana she decided that hecate s cryptic warning must refer to her fearing that diana would steal hecate s soul and power circe decided to destroy her once diana learned of hecate s pronouncement she too felt it pertained to her but of course diana has no desire to have the soul of hecate possessing her body this issue is central to the conflict between the two women war of the gods edit circe s most ambitious gambit was inciting war between the various pantheons of gods throughout the dc multiverse becoming known as the war of the gods circe s overall ploy was to gain the power of all the warring pantheons after they had defeated or destroyed one another another plot of the war was to disgrace diana and the amazons in the eyes of the world by portraying them as terrorists allying herself with the amazons of bana mighdall to this effect true to her nature circe eventually betrayed them as well over the course of the war circe succeeded in killing hermes who had since been in a severely weakened state from being away from olympus for so long and temporarily devolving diana herself out of existence by reverting her back into the clay from which she had been formed finally realizing the truth of circe s deceptions earth s heroes launched an assault on new olympus which circe had conquered and pitted the gods of the olympian and roman pantheons against them elsewhere with the aid of the spectre deadman and the phantom stranger diana was restored to life and in a concerted effort with donna troy used the amulet of harmonia to open a portal into an alternate universe where the titans of myth resided this caused the soul of hecate herself to withdraw from circe s body which rapidly aged and crumbled to dust hecate then attempted to take possession of diana but was destroyed by the lasso of truth 19 circe returned to life sometime later though no explanation has ever been given for this amazon betrayal edit after the amazons of bana mighdall lost their egyptian city at the hands of diana s gods and turned to circe for revenge circe remained true to her word and granted the bana mighdallian amazons immortality and teleported them to themyscira in order for them to take over the island for themselves unfortunately for them though after this was done circe eventually showed her hatred for all amazons by betraying the alliance she had with the desert amazons and cast the island and all its inhabitants into a dimension of demons thus both tribes of amazons spent several years battling demons for their own survival when diana discovered what the witch had done she forced circe to return the island back to its original location after losing a bet with the amazon this is not the only time circe has lost a bet to wonder woman and was forced to cancel a spell made against her later circe caused queen hippolyta to forget who she was and instead embrace the false life of a domestic housewife circe told diana that if she could get hippolyta to drink the antidote she would call off her attack diana was successful and circe showed herself honorable once more by reversing all magical effects as promised donna milton edit circe as donna milton discovering her true identity art by mike deodato one attempt circe made in trying to destroy diana involved a disguise as a mortal lawyer named donna milton 20 in this persona she could get close enough to diana in order to kill her when her defenses were low afraid that diana would see through her disguise with her power of truth circe cast a spell on herself the spell made circe believe that she actually was donna milton and her true persona would only return when donna could strike 21 as donna milton she was hired by the mobster ares buchanan who was really the god ares in disguise himself during their time together they formed a romantic relationship and donna became pregnant as donna circe actually became a good friend of diana and ended up saving her life from ares he was sucked into a miniature black hole while donna went into labor no longer working for ares donna gave birth to her daughter lyta milton 22 and became diana s lawyer at her and micah rains new detective agency 23 when the amazon artemis single handedly battled the white magician diana realized that donna was actually circe and begged her to help transport her to artemis side not believing diana and hurt that her friend would think her to be a villain donna yelled at diana to leave and subconsciously teleported diana to artemis shocked circe s memories slowly began coming back to her still possessing some of donna s false memories she teleported herself to diana in order to help her in her battle but she was not on top of her game as she still had ties to her donna milton body and the white magician was not affected by her magical attacks she used the remainder of her power to save diana by teleporting herself a demonically altered cheetah and cassandra arnold a television reporter and the white magician s lover away from the battle leaving her last words to diana be you re my only friend diana expanded horizons edit circe would make a faustian deal with the demon lord neron to sell her soul to him in exchange for increased magical powers 24 she later formed part of the injustice gang gathered by lex luthor alongside the joker dr light and the ocean master during a fight with the jla she became preoccupied with plastic man his shapeshifting powers allowed him to immediately change out of the animal forms she turned him into she later proposed both a business and romantic relationship with luthor which he immediately shot down 18 25 the witch and the warrior edit circe tries to take over new york city with her super powered allies art by phil jimenez shortly before imperiex assaulted the earth circe struck at diana through her friends she allied herself with sebastian ballesteros who had usurped the power of the cheetah from barbara ann minerva and turned diana s friend vanessa kapatelis into the new silver swan ballestros also became circe s lover she reveals herself after vanessa attacks wonder girl luring diana into battle after hippolyta dies saving diana from an imperiex probe circe launches an attack on new york city her scheme involved the transformation of all male superheroes into her bestiamorphs save for j onn jonzz beast boy and plastic man whom she took special means to keep imprisoned due to their shape shifting abilities she also imprisoned and transformed her former confederates in the injustice gang taking particular delight in tormenting luthor as he had spurned her advances in his early presidency since the only persons who were not affected by the spell were women many female superheroes entered the city in an attempt to save their friends and stop the witch s plan however circe had planned for such a rescue and convinced various members of the supervillainess communities to join forces and stop the heroines by any means necessary leading the pack against circe was wonder woman who circe also expected sending a doomsday altered superman she hoped to demoralize the world by making superman and wonder woman kill one another while she transmitted the fight in a global simulcast ultimately circe was unsuccessful in her plan as a majority of the superheroines were able to change their male counterparts back to normal with the use of the moly herb which has a tendency to disrupt circe s magic after a protracted fight diana broke circe s spell on superman with her lasso luthor and the joker managed to free themselves and threaten circe s daughter she quickly overpowered them and escaped with her allies circe continued to harass diana and donna troy appearing in their dreams as a dying hippolyta diana tracked circe to the parthenon where they fought in single combat again on a global simulcast circe had cast spells on herself to make her diana s physical equal but ultimately she was defeated during the fight she claimed her hatred of diana was fueled by the hypocrisy and naivete she perceived in diana s beliefs in a better world she attempted to goad diana into killing her but diana spared her instead 26 she was also rescued from possible death by the two living gorgon sisters stheno and euryale once the island of themyscira toppled into the sea as repayment circe revived their long dead sister medusa who eventually became a fellow enemy of wonder woman shortly after medusa s defeat circe s daughter lyta was kidnapped by her father ares while under the protection of the amazons on themyscira confronting ares she soon discovered that the time of the gods was at a crossroads and joined ares as his consort as the new ruler of tartarus thus lyta continued to be cared for by both of her parents reunited one year later

s rogues gallery increasing their power beyond their wildest imaginings circe stole diana s powers explaining her rationale for doing so was to avenge wronged women whom she believed diana had no real interest in helping after completing the spell circe is shown in an altered wonder woman style costume and proceeds to slaughter slave traders in various cities this greatly resembles a previous occurrence written by phil jimenez in which circe magically caused herself to possess the strength of earth s strongest woman during her battle with diana she proceeded to alter her costume several times diana eventually regains her powers from circe but it was revealed that circe and hercules were the only greek gods to disobey athena s orders to leave the earthly realm it is assumed that she left her daughter lyta in the care of her father ares volume issue needed she was also responsible for giving everyman his shapeshifting powers back in order to replace sarge steel at the department
