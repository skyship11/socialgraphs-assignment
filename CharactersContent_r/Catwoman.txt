for film provided the impetus for several batman characters among them catwoman kane s inspiration for catwoman was drawn from multiple sources to include actresses jean harlow hedy lamarr and his cousin ruth steele 10 11 12 kane and finger wanted to give their comic book sex appeal as well as a character who could appeal to female readers they thus created a friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in batman s rather sterile life 13 catwoman was meant to be a love interest and to engage batman in a chess game with him trying to reform her at the same time this character was meant to be different from other batman villains like the joker in that she was never a killer or evil selina kyle s first appearance as the cat in batman 1 spring 1940 as for using cat imagery with the character kane stated that he and finger saw cats as kind of the antithesis of bats 14 i felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs while dogs are faithful and friendly cats are cool detached and unreliable i felt much warmer with dogs around me cats are as hard to understand as women are men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman you always need to keep women at arm s length we don t want anyone taking over our souls and women have a habit of doing that so there s a love resentment thing with women i guess women will feel that i m being chauvinistic to speak this way but i do feel that i ve had better relationships with male friends than women with women once the romance is over somehow they never remain my friends bob kane 15 golden age catwoman then called the cat first appeared in batman 1 spring 1940 16 as a mysterious burglar and jewel thief revealed at the end of the story to be a young attractive unnamed woman having

again as a criminal in batman 84 june 1954 and detective comics 211 september 1954 which were her two final appearances until 1966 this was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing

of themed weapons vehicles and equipment such as a custom cat themed car called the cat illac this usage also appeared in the 1960s batman television series in her post crisis appearances catwoman s favored weapon is a whip she wields both a standard bullwhip and a cat o nine tails with expert proficiency she uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation she can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her catwoman uses caltrops as an anti personnel weapon and bolas to entangle opponents at a distance catwoman has also been shown to have various items to restrain her victims such as rope for binding hands and feet and a roll of duct tape used to gag her targets as she has done with various victims during her robberies over the years often especially in the tv series she uses sleeping gas or knockout darts to subdue victims catwoman s attractiveness
