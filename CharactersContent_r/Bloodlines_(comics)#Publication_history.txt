formerly imprisoned survivors of a race of alien parasites named angon gemir glonth lissik pritor venev and slodd that could shapeshift into humanoid form these humanoid forms were based on the initial entities they first encountered a squadron of l e g i o n soldiers most of whom perished the bite of the bloodlines parasites was administered to the back of the neck by a mouth within a mouth this bite is intended to remove the spinal fluid for sustenance this usually killed the victim for food but occasionally awakened superhuman powers in the recipient this was also the means by which the creatures could reproduce each of the annuals involved in the crossover used this plot device to introduce a new super powered character to the dc universe the bloodlines crossover event spanned 23 of dc s regular titles and wrapped up in the two part miniseries bloodbath the alien parasites that came to earth to gather spinal fluid sacrificed themselves to help birth a gigantic alien known as the taker many long term heroes were absorbed into the monster only to be saved by the very heroes the parasites had created this series spun off into the blood pack miniseries gunfire also had a short lived series some of the heroes created by the aliens died in the 2005 2006 s infinite crisis event the only new blood character to succeed as an independent property was hitman who first

remaining members of the bloodpack only to have a majority of the team killed or maimed by the titular villain it was referenced in the justice league of america tie in to the blackest night crossover where doctor light mockingly mentions that most of the blood pack heroes had died and were quickly forgotten by the rest of the superhero community hitman jla 1 set before this sees the wally west flash mention the bloodline heroes long casualty list and states with irritation that most of them are incompetent and are constantly trying to team up with the league while green lantern kyle rayner simply sums them up with those guys are lame i mean they are really lame hitman and hitman jla both offered up sequels to bloodlines the first had the cia trying to duplicate the power giving effects of the parasites the second set chronologically earlier had a separate breed of bloodlines parasites hitman jla also had a scene showing the white house taking the bloodlines parasites as so big a threat that they were willing to launch nuclear missiles at the justice league to prevent the parasites from reaching earth again bloodlines parasites edit origins edit the seven bloodlines parasites

i o n officers whom they killed and took their alternate human forms from they later ended up on earth while there they took to feeding on humans feeding edit the aliens feed by draining the spinal fluid of their prey after administering a small dose of paralytic venom they feed using a secondary proboscis like jaw similar to the xenomorphs from the alien movies if the feeding process is performed on a human possessing the metagene the trauma of feeding on that victim will usually activate their metagene granting them superpowers those so activated took to calling themselves new bloods 1 biology edit the eight aliens included the seven parasites all parasites had a heavy exoskeleton four digits on each limb one of which is small and opposable skeletal faces and the

over to feed the taker 1 2 parasites return edit jla a new group of parasitic aliens from the same universe infiltrated a space shuttle returning to earth when the jla sent green lantern to investigate his ring s readings showed that these parasites had genetic similarities with the bloodlines parasites these aliens however were much smaller and permanently attached themselves to their human hosts they controlled their hosts minds could communicate telepathically and gave each non superpowered host a superpower these new parasites managed to take control of or incapacitate the entire justice league on the moon in order to stop them from reaching earth hitman who was invited to the jla watchtower so that his blood could be analyzed had to kill or maim several of the astronaut hosts while some members of the jla felt that this was murder others recognized that hitman stopped the invasion in the only way that he could 3 batman and the outsiders another parasite
