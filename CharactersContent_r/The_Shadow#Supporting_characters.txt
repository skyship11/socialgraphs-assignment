publication history edit see also list of the shadow stories origin of the character s name edit to boost the sales of its detective story magazine street smith publications hired david chrisman of the ruthrauff ryan advertising agency and writer director william sweets to adapt the magazine s stories into a radio series chrisman and sweets thought the upcoming series should be narrated by a mysterious storyteller with a sinister voice and began searching for a suitable name one of their scriptwriters harry engman charlot suggested various possibilities such as the inspector or the sleuth 4 charlot then proposed the ideal name for the phantom announcer the shadow 4 thus beginning on july 31 1930 1 5 the shadow was the name given to the mysterious narrator of the detective story hour radio program the narrator was initially voiced by james lacurto 5 who was replaced after four months by prolific character actor frank readick jr the episodes were drawn from the detective story magazine issued by street smith the nation s oldest and largest publisher of pulp magazines 5 although the latter company had hoped the radio broadcasts would boost the declining sales of detective story magazine the result was quite different listeners found the sinister announcer much more compelling than the unrelated stories they soon began asking newsdealers for copies of that shadow detective magazine even though it did not exist 5 creation as a distinctive literary character edit who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men the shadow as depicted on the cover of the july 15 1939 issue of the shadow magazine the story death from nowhere was one of the magazine plots adapted for the legendary radio drama recognizing the demand and responding promptly circulation manager henry william ralston of street smith commissioned walter b gibson to begin writing stories about the shadow using the pen name of maxwell grant and claiming the stories were from the shadow s private annals as told to him gibson wrote 282 out of 325 tales over the next 20 years a novel length story twice a month 1st and 15th the first story produced was the living shadow published april 1 1931 5 gibson s characterization of the shadow laid the foundations for the archetype of the superhero including stylized imagery and title sidekicks supervillains and a secret identity clad in black the shadow operated mainly after dark as a vigilante in the name of justice terrifying criminals into vulnerability gibson himself claimed the literary inspirations upon which he had drawn were bram stoker s dracula and edward bulwer lytton s the house and the brain 4 another possible inspiration citation needed for the shadow is the french character judex the first episode of the original judex film serial was released in the united states as the mysterious shadow and judex s costume is similar to the shadow s french comics historian xavier fournier notes other similarities with another silent serial the shielding shadow whose protagonist had a power of invisibility and considers the shadow to be a mix between the two characters in the 1940s some shadow comic strips were translated in france as adventures of judex 6 because of the great effort involved in writing two full length novels every month several guest writers were hired to write occasional installments in order to lighten gibson s workload those guest writers included lester dent who also wrote the doc savage stories and theodore tinsley in the late 1940s mystery novelist bruce elliott also a magician temporarily replaced gibson as the primary author of the pulp series 7 richard wormser a reader for street smith wrote two shadow stories 8 for a complete list of street and smith s shadow novels see the list of the shadow stories article belmont books a new beginning edit the shadow magazine ceased publication with the summer 1949 issue but walter b gibson wrote three new official stories between 1963 and 1980 the first began a new series of nine shadow mass market paperback novels from belmont books in this series the shadow is given psychic powers including the radio character s ability to cloud men s minds so that he effectively became invisible starting with return of the shadow under his own name the remaining eight novels in this series the shadow strikes shadow beware cry shadow the shadow s revenge mark of the shadow shadow go mad night of the shadow and the shadow destination moon were written by dennis lynds not gibson under the maxwell grant pseudonym the other two gibson works were the novelettes the riddle of the rangoon ruby published june 1 1979 in the shadow scrapbook 9 10 and blackmail bay published february 1 1980 in the duende history of the shadow magazine 11 12 literary sequels and reboots edit the shadow returned in 2015 in the authorized novel the sinister shadow an entry in the wild adventures of doc savage series from altus press the novel written by will murray used unpublished material originally written in 1932 by doc savage originator lester dent and published under the pen name kenneth robeson set in 1933 the story details the conflict between the two pulp magazine icons during a crime wave caused by a murderous kidnapping extortion ring led by the mysterious criminal mastermind known as the funeral director a sequel empire of doom was published in 2016 and takes place seven years later in 1940 the shadow s old enemy shiwan khan attacks his hated adversary doc savage joins forces with the shadow to vanquish khan in a doc savage

arrangement also includes potential screen adaptions of these novels 13 14 the first novel the shadow released in 2021 serves as a sequel update with some science fiction elements bringing lamont cranston from 1937 into 2087 to battle shiwan khan in a futuristic new york character development edit the character and look of the shadow gradually evolved over his lengthy fictional existence as depicted in the pulps the shadow wore a wide brimmed black hat and a black crimson lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit in the 1940s comic books the later comic book series and the 1994 film starring alec baldwin he wore either the black hat or a wide brimmed black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across his mouth and chin both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double breasted trench coat or a regular black suit as seen in some of the later comics series the shadow also would wear his hat and scarf with either a black inverness coat or inverness cape citation needed in the radio drama that debuted in 1937 the shadow does not wear a costume because he is invisible when he operates as a vigilante a feature born out of necessity time constraints of 1930s radio made it difficult to explain to listeners where the shadow was hiding and how he remained concealed from criminals until he was ready to strike so the character was given invisibility meaning the criminals like the radio audience only knew him by his haunting voice the actors used their normal voice when the hero was in his civilian identity of lamont cranston and effects were added when he became invisible and acted as the shadow his voice now having a sinister and seemingly omnipresent quality to explain this power radio episodes regularly said that while a young man the shadow traveled around the world and then through the orient where he learned how to read thoughts and became a master of hypnotism granting him the mysterious power to cloud men s minds so they could not see him in the episode the temple bells of neban 1937 the shadow said he developed these abilities in india specifically under the guidance of a yogi priest who was keeper of the temple of cobras in delhi he does not wear a mask or any disguise while invisible and so in episodes such as the temple bells of neban 1937 he is cautious when he meets an enemy who could potentially disrupt his hypnotic abilities exposing his true face and instantly making him a visible target for attack background edit the living shadow from the shadow 1 april 7 1931 in the print adventures the shadow is kent allard although his real name is not revealed until the shadow unmasks 1937 early stories explain he was once a famed aviator who fought for the french during world war i known by the alias the black eagle according to one character in the shadow s shadow 1933 later stories revised this alias as the dark eagle beginning with the shadow unmasks after the war s conclusion allard finds a new challenge in waging war on criminals allard falsifies his death by crash landing his plane in guatemala encountering the indigenous xinca tribe as a result who see him as a supernatural being and provide him with two loyal aides allard returns to the united states and takes residence in new york city adopting numerous identities to acquire valuable information and conceal his true nature and recruiting a variety of agents to aid his war on crime only a few of whom are aware of his other identities as the vigilante called the shadow allard hunts down and often violently confronts criminals armed with colt 45 pistols and sometimes using magician tricks to convince his prey that he s supernatural one such trick is the devil s whisper a chemical compound on the thumb and forefinger causing a flash of bright flame and sharp explosion when he snaps his fingers the shadow is also known for wearing a girasol ring with a purple stone sometimes depicted as a red stone in cover artwork gifted to kent allard from the czar of russia the romanoff jewels 1932 during world war i the ring is later said to be one of two rings made with gemstones taken from the eyes of an idol made by the xinca tribe the shadow unmasks 1937 the shadow s best known alter ego is lamont cranston a wealthy young man about town in the pulps cranston is a separate character a rich playboy who travels the world while the shadow uses his identity and resources in new york the shadow laughs 1931 the shadow s disguise as cranston works well because the two men resemble each other dictator of crime 1941 in their first meeting the shadow threatens cranston saying that unless the playboy agrees to allow the aviator to use his identity when he is abroad then allard will simply take over the man s identity entirely having already made arrangements to begin the process including switching signatures on various documents although alarmed at first the real lamont cranston agrees deciding that sharing his resources and identity is better than losing both entirely the two men sometimes meet afterward in order to impersonate each other crime over miami 1940 as cranston the shadow often attends the cobalt club an exclusive restaurant and lounge catering to the wealthy and associates with new york city police commissioner ralph weston the shadow s other disguises include businessman henry arnaud who like cranston is a real person whose identity allard simply assumes at times as revealed in arnaud s first appearance the black master march 1 1932 elderly isaac twambley who first appears in no time for murder december 1944 and fritz an old seemingly slow witted uncommunicative janitor who works at police headquarters listening in on conversations and examining recovered evidence first appearing in the living shadow april 1931 in teeth of the dragon and later stories including the golden pagoda the shadow is known in chinatown as ying ko often fighting the criminal tong in the 2015 altus press novel the sinister shadow by will murray the shadow masquerades as celebrated criminologist george clarendon of chicago a past member of the cobalt club and long time friend of commissioner weston for the first half of the shadow s tenure in the pulps his past and true identity outside of his cranston disguise are ambiguous in the living shadow a thug claiming to have seen the shadow s face recalls seeing a piece of white that looked like a bandage in the black master and the shadow s shadow the villains of both stories see the shadow s true face and remark the vigilante is a man of many faces with no face of his own it was not until the august 1937 issue the shadow unmasks that the shadow s real name was revealed in the radio drama series that premiered in 1937 the allard secret identity and backstory were dropped for simplicity s sake the radio incarnation of the shadow is really and only lamont cranston with no other regular cover identities though he does adopt disguises and short term aliases during some adventures the radio version of cranston travels the world to learn the old mysteries that modern science has not yet rediscovered death house rescue in 1937 along with learning skills and knowledge in europe africa and asia he spends time training with a yogi priest keeper of the temple of cobras in delhi and learns how to read thoughts and hypnotize people enough to cloud their minds making himself invisible to them as revealed in the episode the temple bells of neban in 1937 he explicitly states in several episodes that his talents are not magic but based on science returning to new york he decides he can best aid the police and his city by operating outside the law as an invisible vigilante he is somewhat less ruthless and more compassionate than the pulp incarnation and without the vast network of agents and operatives only cab driver chauffeur shrevvy makes regular appearances on the radio series but the character is different from his print counterpart commissioner weston and a few other supporting characters from the print stories also are adapted to radio supporting characters edit margo lane and the shadow art by alex ross the shadow has a network of agents who assist him in his war on crime these include harry vincent a man who tries to commit suicide in the first shadow story the shadow saves and recruits him after which vincent is a regular recurring character in the pulp stories and one of the most trusted agents moses moe shrevnitz a k a shrevvy a cab driver who doubles as his chauffeur the radio version of shrevvy is dim witted and does not knowingly work for the shadow aiding lamont cranston on many occasions peter boyle performed the role in the 1994 film margo lane a socialite created for the radio drama and introduced in the debut episode the death house rescue as the shadow s companion who loves him margo aids the shadow in nearly every radio episode and was later introduced into the pulps as one of his agents penelope ann miller performed the role in the 1994 film in which margo had the power of telepathy allowing her to pierce the shadow s hypnotic

them notably gleaning information from his many chats as cranston at the cobalt club with nypd commissioner ralph weston and later commissioner wainwright barth who is also cranston s uncle portrayed by jonathan winters in the 1994 film weston believes cranston is merely a rich playboy who dabbles in detective work out of curiosity another police contact is detective later inspector joseph cardona a key character in many shadow novels in contrast to the pulps the shadow radio drama limited the cast of major characters to the shadow commissioner weston and margo lane the last of whom was created for the radio series along with giving the shadow a love interest margo was created because it was believed that including harry vincent as a regular would mean an overabundance of male characters considering the criminals in the stories were usually male too and could possibly make it difficult for the audience to distinguish between the voices of so many male actors 15 the radio script for the death house rescue reprinted in the shadow scrapbook features harry vincent but he did not appear in the actual radio broadcast or any episode of the radio drama series clyde burke made occasional appearances but not as an agent of the shadow lieutenant cardona was a minor character in several episodes moe shrevnitz identified only as shrevvy made several appearances as a simple minded acquaintance of cranston and lane who sometimes acted as their chauffeur unaware cranston was actually the shadow enemies edit the shadow also faces a wide variety of enemies ranging from kingpins and

shadow character was used to host segments of the blue coal radio revue airing on sundays at 5 30 p m eastern standard time this marked the beginning of a long association between the radio persona and sponsor blue coal while functioning as a narrator of the blue coal radio revue the character was recycled by street smith in october 1931 for its newly created love story hour contrary to dozens of encyclopedias published reference guides and even walter gibson himself the shadow never served as narrator of love story hour he appeared only in advertisements for the shadow magazine at the end of each episode 17 in october 1932 the radio persona temporarily moved to nbc frank readick jr again played the role of the sinister voiced host on mondays and wednesdays both at 6 30 p m with la

explains he spent years studying in london paris vienna egypt china and india learning different fields of science as well as the old mysteries that modern science has not yet rediscovered the natural magic that modern psychology is beginning to understand he states his hypnotic and seemingly telepathic abilities are not magic but based on scientific secrets most of the world has forgotten or does not yet understand in the temple bells of neban in 1937 he specifies that a yogi priest keeper of the temple of cobras in delhi taught him how to be invisible by clouding peoples minds he indicates in the death house rescue that he always intended to use his acquired knowledge to secretly fight evil forces that evaded conventional authorities in the same episode when his companion margo lane suggests he work openly with the police cranston implies the police and general public would not understand or approve of his strange methods and abilities concluding he is only effective by working outside of the law the radio version of the shadow is less ruthless than his pulp counterpart preferring to capture his foes more often than gun them down he sometimes openly shows compassion for his enemies even at time criticizing society for creating circumstances that lead to certain crimes and cause some people to lose hope and support after welles departed the show in 1938 bill johnstone was chosen to replace him and voiced the character for five seasons following johnstone s departure the shadow was portrayed by such actors as bret morrison the longest tenure with 10 years total in two
