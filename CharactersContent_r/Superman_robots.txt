when readers were first introduced to superman possessing various robot duplicates these robots each possessed a fraction of the man of steel s powers and were sometimes used to substitute for him on missions such as those where kryptonite was present or for the purposes of protecting his secret identity to that end superman also possessed a few clark kent robots 1 one notable superman robot was named ajax also known as wonder man 2 other superman robots had other names including robot z 3 robot x 3 4 and macduff 5 the idea of superman robots were extended into superboy stories of the period as well where it was revealed that superboy also possessed robot duplicates of himself both as superboy and as clark kent nearly all of these robots were either deactivated or converted into adult sized robots when superboy grew up to become superman 6 there was also supergirl and linda lee robots so that superman s teenage cousin could be a hero while at the same time seemingly be at class 7 also while not superman robots per se superman had other machines who could pass for human for example in one 1960 superman story mr and mrs crandall adopt bizarro s human looking infant son who had wandered into midvale orphanage the crandalls were really robots who only pretended to adopt the baby so that their master superman could take custody of the child 8 in the early 1970s the superman comics largely abandoned the use of superman robots as part of a change in the books tone and writing style the excuse given in the comics was that earth s pollution levels and artificial radiation had rendered superman s robots unusable 9 modern age versions edit the notion of superman robots was reintroduced for post crisis comic continuity in a late 1990s storyline during the period where superman under the control of dominus felt he must police the entire earth 24 hours a day 7 days a week he built an army of superman robots created in his own image all wearing the famous s shield but wearing variations of the red blue and yellow costume however unlike the pre crisis superman robots these automata were not realistic androids capable of passing for the real superman but instead were obviously mechanical with metallic bodies that possessed no artificial skin these modern superman robot s powers included super strength flight and heat vision but were inferior to superman s own powers the superman robots were also given a small degree of sentience making each one an autonomous agent of the man of steel their job was to protect mankind aggressively if necessary and attend to crises beyond superman s reach once dominus had been defeated superman had most of the robots destroyed one particular robot programmed to protect lois was particularly difficult to get rid of in superman vol 2 170 jeph loeb wrote a story where in defending lois lane from certain death krypto almost killed mongul by ripping his throat out believing that krypto was too dangerous to have around superman confined him to the fortress of solitude a superman robot nicknamed ned presumably the same one programmed to protect lois was employed as krypto s caretaker the robot was programmed to give off superman s scent every now and again to keep krypto happy in a later storyline brainiac 8 revived and increased the power to a forgotten superman robot the robot attacked the teen titans killing troia and omen before it was defeated 10 other versions edit in superman red son the superman robots are actually soviet citizens lobotomized and fitted with cybernetic implants as punishment for
