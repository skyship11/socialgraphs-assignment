with her partner sam simeon 3 sam differs from many stereotypical detectives besides helping angel sam is both a comic book artist and a talking gorilla 4 sam s name is a double pun on the word simian of or pertaining to an ape or monkey and the san simeon estate of publisher william randolph hearst 5 in the first few stories sam draws comics for a self obsessed editor named stan bragg then moves to a competitor working for morton stoops 6 revivals edit the series has been revived twice the first was by phil foglio in the 1990s where angel and the ape stuck true to its zany roots in phil foglio s 1991 mini series angel is revealed to be the half sister of the dumb bunny a member of the super heroic group the inferior five also created by bridwell sam is changed too he is not only employed by dz comics as an artist but is also the grandson of gorilla grodd a nemesis of the flash as such sam has mental powers that he can use to make a limited number of people see him as a human being however a break in his concentration allows people to see him in his true form this is in contrast to the original series wherein people see sam s true form but convince themselves he is simply an unusually ape like human male since it is impossible for there to be such a thing as a talking gorilla a second revival was made in early 2001 under dc s vertigo imprint with a vastly different
