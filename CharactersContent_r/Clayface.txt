murderous intent because carlinger neglected to invite him to the event but carlinger killed karlo instead feeling threatened by a few actors attending the exhibition who were rumored to be demanding an audit of his production company s finances carlinger used karlo s alter ego to mask his true identity and intentions when he gunned these actors down in cold blood the batman deduced clayface s true identity by the water solubility of his makeup revealing it to be a type of makeup used by modern actors instead of the greasepaint karlo was more likely to use batman punched carlinger s lights out and exposed his murder scheme putting the corrupt movie producer s brief stint as clayface to an abrupt end 11 post crisis edit in the post crisis continuity karlo languishes in a prison hospital

mind of its own but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what cassius wants if bonded with another human it becomes a claything the piece can give that human clayface like abilities such as becoming soft and malleable being able to withstand bullets and other forms of harm and could also manifest payne s ability to melt objects all this person would have to do to perform such an action is to think about it cassius finds it very painful and distressing to have pieces of himself taken and will go to crazed lengths to recover them when thomas elliot attempted to give himself the shapeshifting abilities of the clayfaces he determined that cassius is the only pure clayface in existence as all others retain fragments of their former human dna where cassius is the only clayface

true identity and an adult jason todd to hurt and confuse bruce wayne 79 80 elliot also takes some samples from williams to try and determine how he can duplicate the shapeshifting aspects of clayface without losing his original form also using these samples to infect batman s ally alfred pennyworth with a virus that allows hush to exert some degree of control over alfred forcing him to commit murder eventually williams realizes he is being manipulated and hush will never help him after hush tries to steal a sample of cassius in the hopes that analysis of the pure clayface the only one who was never human in the first place will help him crack the sample knowing that he is going to die williams offers batman assistance against hush in exchange for protecting his family he redeems himself in his death by providing batman with a sample of himself so that batman can find a cure for the virus infecting alfred also ensuring that alfred is cleared of the murder charges by ensuring that his final appearance after death includes fingerprints that are so similar to alfred s that the detectives conclude that they simply made a mistake 81 powers and abilities edit each of the clayfaces has different powers but they all share the ability to shapeshift in his earliest appearances basil karlo had no powers but wore a clay mask based on one of his movie roles in later comics
