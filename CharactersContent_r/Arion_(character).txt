coming up with new ideas that lead to his backup series when his then editor laurie sutton mentioned that dragonsword the current backup of warlord then was eventually going to end sutton also mentioned the only requirement of the series was that it be set in the sword and sorcery genre kupperburg suggested a story of a young mage while sutton requested it to take place in the fabled location of atlantis during the creation of the series the name of the main character was noted to be a difficult process but eventually arion was settled with the names tynan atlan and orin as contenders 2 although the names weren t used for the main character the names appeared in both arion lord of atlantis and later aquaman titles arion began as a back up feature in the dc comics book warlord with issue 55 3 in which ran until issue 62 before arion gained his own series arion lord of atlantis beginning with 1 november 1982 the series lasted for 35 issues plus a special which wrapped up the original storyline running from november 1982 to september 1985 with the special shipping in november 1985 concurrently between april 1985 march 1986 arion was one of the many characters involved in the crisis on infinite earths crossover title with his history of atlantis inserted into the main dc continuity arion also appeared in dc comics presents in a crossover with superman 4 5 years later in 1991 kupperburg sent in a proposal for what would eventually be arion the immortal a sequel to his original series originally titled arion darkworld and arion lord of order due to elements similar to characters presented in doctor fate and the sandman titles the draft was reworked as to make the characters involved in the book independent of the same lords of chaos and order concept of magic different from the framework established in two dc comic titles as to not interfere with their direction and depiction 6 in 1992 arion would star in his miniseries which ended after the sixth issue establishing him in the modern era he would also make appearances in several aquaman wonder woman and justice league crossovers modern stories edit during the early 2000s despite the efforts to ensure the characters and concepts in the series were dissimilar to both titles many references books and encyclopedias later connected arion s character supporting cast and villains to the same lords of chaos and order characters referenced in other titles 7 8 arion s character would play a role in the jsa title where the character is involved in a conflict connected to the other characters involved in lords of order and chaos and is killed off in the fiftieth issue of the series despite the character s death a past version of the character hailing from the 1600s would appear in 2006 in the camelot falls storyline in the superman title and is depicted as an antagonist to the story concurrently a new incarnation of arion appeared whose real name was william knightly new 52 rebirth onward edit eventually a new version of the character was introduced in the secret six 2014 run by gail simone while making a shilloutte appearance the character s children uvian and his unnamed sons formed a cult known as the children of arion and appeared in one of the main antagonists in the gauntlet storyline in the series 9 the character would eventually make a full appearance in the blue beetle series acting as the main antagonist while the book itself connected the blue beetle s mythos with other magical characters and concepts such as arion himself doctor fate and changing khaji da s origins to suggest it is magically powered form of technology 10 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit origin edit in arion s original origin told to him by calculha arion was a cosmic born from energies coalesced into form because of his standing as a cosmic being he is capable of affecting the balance between both order and chaos and because of that is chosen as an unwitting agent he is found by his aged mentor calculha who is considered the most powerful sorcerer of his time and is tutored in the art of magic and spell casting through their training they form a bond similar to that of father and son 11 in his revised origin story much of the elements of his original backstory changed arion referred to then as ahri ahn is one of the two biological sons of calculha who was formerly featured simply as his father figure and mentor in the earlier issues of warlord and dark majistra a sorceress with an appearance implying her to be an ancestor of those who would eventually become the egyptians as well as the fraternal twin of garn daanuth ahri ahn was prophesied to be a savior of atlantis shortly after their birth calculha and majistra separated leaving the two unaware of their true relation to one another for thousands of years as they grew up their parents became political rivals as they were representatives of a cabal of sorcerers from various mythological locations while ahri ahn was taught white magic by their father garn was taught black magic by their mother the two brothers eventually meet for the first time and bore witness to their parent s differing vision for atlantis through the use of powerful mystical artifacts known as the zodiac crystals crystals shaped like the zodiac signs that controlled the magical flow of earth while calculha called upon the cabal to keep them separate and senses the impending interference majistra sought to combine all crystals in an attempt to create a new era of mystical enlightenment despite the risks despite being outvoted majistra would instead use the crystals to further her own power proving to be the very interference calculha sensed ahri ahn sacrificed his life to prevent his mother from attaining power but at a cost both his father and mother would become trapped in an extradimensional realm known as darkworld garn s skin was drained of color and gave him the appearance of an albino arion s body was converted into energy and sent into a star while his soul was sent into darkworld as well and the family feud caused earth s first ice age eventually calculha used his newfound might he gained in over the course of 100 000 years in his imprisonment and resurrected his son with the aid of wyynde into his second incarnation which was christened arion by wyynde a corruption of his actual name he is taken to atlantis and is made lord high mage for the king of atlantis d tilluh eventually he is re taught magic he had forgotten by calculha and becomes one of atlantis s foremost protectors aided by his companions wyynde atlantean lieutenant guardsman and lady chian captain of d tilluh s royal guard and lover 12 later additions to his origin expand on the time in which his soul existed in a state of intangibility in darkworld as he was raised by sorceress jheryl and befriended the imp ghy also teaching him magic she created the very red gemstone he bore with him after his resurrection as arion and served as his motherly figure in place of majistra when called back to the land of the living by his father the sudden departure from one realm to another blocked his memory of his time in the darkworld owing to its unique regard to time only twenty years passed in the realm while 100 000 years passed on earth 13 arion lord of atlantis 1982 1985 edit throughout his life as lord high mage arion would have many adventures he would encounter and be pitted against various gods of the atlantean pantheon ended the ice age at the cost of his own magical power and sought ways to reclaim his former might he would also encounter garn and learn of their true connections as well as gain a new ally mara eventually arion defeated garn once and for all by sealing him away in darkworld arion would also reclaim his magical power when he was lured into darkworld by his mother in a plot to gain more power through a connection to darkworld like its respective denizens with his soul re worked by the deity known only as the weaver arion gains his former might but is unable to stop the destruction of atlantis when chaon one of the atlantean dark gods led an alien race later revealed to be descendants of atlanteans that ventured into space against atlantis and sunk it himself with the empire fractured the remaining atlanteans venture to other corners of the globe to rebuild 14 crisis on infinite earths edit see also crisis on infinite earths arion would appear in the crisis on infinite earth crossover as being among the heroes taken in by habringer and aids the heroes post crisis edit owing to the events of crisis on infinite earths arion s universe now exists in the same dc multiverse with a few changes arion s version of atlantis took place in the distant past roughly around 500 000 years before the main dcu timeline and is explained that despite arion s belief atlantis as a whole wasn t destroyed 15 he was also made part of powergirl s backstory being his great granddaughter jettisoned into the future her powers said to originate from arion s experimentation in genetic manipulation 16 and an ancestor of zatanna zatara through her mother s side 17 eventually arion and characters within his series would be connected to dc s homo magi and the lords of chaos and order the aforementioned sorcerer being among the lords of order affiliated characters like his father and mother would also be retconned into being deities themselves making him an actual being of divine origin 1 later an aged arion is revealed to be immortal and to have lost his magic and is living in greenwich village along with several former atlantean gods and goddesses including chaon deedra gemimn and the weaver his companion mara was trapped in canine form when the magic was lost 18 arion renews his old rivalry with his brother garn daanuth and works to stop the return of atlantean magic by preventing darkworld revealed to be a

spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by power girl and hawkgirl along with a recently awakened dove in order to weaken mordru before his soul departed arion revealed to power girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an atlantean arion seemingly reappeared in infinite crisis as one of the mystics gathered in atlantis to keep the spectre at bay and later in the day of vengeance tie in special as one of several magical beings summoned to help rebuild the shattered rock of eternity no explanation was given for arion s involvement at the time it was later revealed that this arion was in fact a pretender a native of akron named bill knightley who had decided to trade on arion s name and reputation to build himself up in the mystical community 21 camelot falls edit a past version of arion later appears in the year 1659 arion is awakened from a night of debauchery by visions of a cataclysmic future centered around the presence of superman cut off from his natural magics arion employed certain artifacts to propel himself forward to superman s present arriving in metropolis arion subjected superman and his friends at the daily planet to a vision of a possible future where superman and other alien heroes involvement in humanity caused people to become dependent on them ultimately producing an apocalypse as their alien intervention held back the natural cycle of civilizations falling upon reaching their peak culminating in a mass apocalypse as the darkness they had held back for so long came at them with full force arion hoped to force superman to retire and prevent the predictions from coming true superman was given two weeks in which to decide how he would deal with arion s request during which arion illustrated his point by magically steering a field trip of adolescent new gods chaperoned by lightray and fastbak to come crashing into metropolis and go wild with their divine powers causing untold havoc and general interference with the populace superman defused the situation with lightray s help and deduced arion s involvement at roughly the same time arion kidnapped bill knightley from outside the oblivion bar interrogated him and nearly killed him the only thing that saved knightley was his knowledge of the recently begun tenth age of magic a tumultuous change in the world s mystical equilibrium knightley claimed to be studying the shift and arion decided he might have some value alive 22 at the end of the two weeks arion and superman met again superman chose to remain active as part of earth s defense and deeply involved with humanity refusing to give up hope that he could make a difference arion s vicious response was to cast a powerful mind manipulation spell with the intent of using superman as a weapon to remove the threat of other alien heroes superman was able to resist thanks to training from the martian manhunter after his period under the control of maxwell lord 1 given a mystic shield by the phantom stranger to protect him from direct assault by arion s magics during which the stranger revealed that while arion s prediction could come to pass the loss of life and experience that would result if superman simply allowed civilization to fall meant that mankind had to try to find another way superman was able to defeat arion and disarm him of his rings amulets and charms from which he derived his magic arion was returned to 1659 where he plans his next move on superman in the future the new 52 edit secret six vol 2 the gauntlet 2014 2016 edit although he did not make a

atlan and atlanna blue beetle vol 2 hard choices 2016 edit thousands of years ago arion was believed to have been turned into an insane villain from exposure to the blue beetle scarab and gains a more

scarab into undoing his sealing stealing the scarab for himself to use its power to destroy the world with the help of doctor fate and his allies jaime reyes manages to defeat the sorcerer and his

as a precautionary tale against exploration beyond atlantis fueling atlantean isolationsist policies despite arion s lifetime fighting against it 23 in the aftermath of the events the triumvirate of sea gods would suffer in the graveyard of the gods afterlife bearing a grudge against arion and poseidon and would attempt to extract their revenge thousands of years later poseidon would feel guilty for being the prime reason he fueled atlantis s isolationist policies and his betrayal of his apprentice eventually arion s ancestor arion would reveal the truth to the trio of sea gods and offer them the same power queen mera the ruling monarch of atlantis would also fulfill arion s intents by using the clarion to broadcast her intentions of connecting her kingdom with interested oceanic alien worlds 23 unlike the hard choices storyline in blue beetle the drowned earth crossover suggested arion was insane through the tear of extinction 23 instead of khaji da 10 the 2021 edition of the dc comics encyclopedia addresses the discrepancy stating that he was indeed driven insane although instead of dying as the story suggested he disappeared for a millennia and his fall from grace due to the tear of extinction was covered up by atlantean authorities by claiming he perished the entry also expresses the chronological events that happened afterward including the flashback and present accounts of the character in the hard choices storyline as well as suggesting the camelot falls storyline also took place 24 justice league 2018 backup justice league dark edit in the 2018 justice
