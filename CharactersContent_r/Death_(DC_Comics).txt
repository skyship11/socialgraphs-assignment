greek madame mortabilities incarnation of death and life omnipotence omnipresence omniscience immortality death of the endless is a fictional anthropomorphic personification who appears in american comic books published by dc comics she first appeared in the sandman vol 2 8 august 1989 and was created by neil gaiman and mike dringenberg 1 in the dc universe continuity death is both the end of life and a psychopomp like most anthropomorphic personifications of death death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence unlike most personifications of death she also visits people as they are born according to destruction in the sandman special the song of orpheus evidently only she seems to remember these encounters in the special issue it is also revealed that death was known in ancient greece as teleute just as her brother s dream s realm domain is known as the dreaming death s realm domain is known as the sunless lands physically death is also opposite to the traditional western culture personification of death see grim reaper in the sandman death instead appears as an attractive pale goth girl dressed in casual clothes often a black top and jeans she also wears a silver ankh on a chain around her neck and has a marking similar to the eye of horus around her right eye 2 she is pleasant down to earth perky and has been a nurturing figure for both incarnations of dream this irony has helped make death one of the most popular characters from sandman death was named the fifteenth greatest comic book character by empire 3 as azrael death appears

other personifications of death have appeared in the dc universe in captain atom 42 death appears alongside black racer of the new gods and nekron a being embodying the will of the black the solitude and peace death represents from green lantern the story stated that all three were equal representing different aspects of death gaiman has denied this however and his stories make it clear that death of the endless is the ultimate personification of death it might be assumed however nekron the racer and the black flash are connected to her in some way alternatively there may be multiple avatars or gods of death in the dc universe besides those claiming to be death blackest night has resolved this apparent contradiction or ambiguity with nekron no longer being referred to as an aspect of death but instead as a construct formed of darkness in response to the emerging light of the emotional spectrum a more traditional version of death a skeleton in a bluish or purplish cloak appeared as host in such dc titles such as weird mystery tales house of secrets ghosts weird war tales including being in the story in issue 94 dc comics presents 29 etc weird war tales typically featured death as a skeleton in some sort of military uniform relevant to the era and locality of the war depicted this character appeared as recently as elvira s house of mystery 2 february 1986 how this pre crisis death relates to gaiman s death if at all is unclear although her older brother destiny appeared with the character 6 and both deaths have appeared with incarnations of superman superman referred to the earlier death with the term grim reaper so perhaps that could be regarded as a distinct character however in the pages of weird war tales he called himself death 7 he also appeared when weird war tales was published under the vertigo imprint and in the 2010 weird war tales one shot death first appeared as a woman in the witching hour 56 july 1975 in a tale told by mordred written by carl wessler and illustrated by ruben yandoc she was depicted with short curly red blonde hair and was a rival for two men s affections both men die in successive car accidents death right with new bride maggie brennan and the phantom stranger art by dan spiegle in swamp thing vol 2 6 the phantom stranger met death in the form of a middle aged gentleman possibly inspired by death takes a holiday in the story a young woman margaret maggie brennan had what should have been a minor head injury and at one glimpse of death chose to become death s bride as someone newly dead herself she taught death that he needs to show compassion for the newly dead to allay their fears he takes her advice and they both serve as aspects of death this version of death was created by mike w barr and dan spiegle maggie is blonde and bears only minor physical resemblance to gaiman and dringenberg s version though her compassionate nature is a similarity in the spectre vol 2 the phantom stranger himself appeared to be the only psychopomp in the dc universe the current incarnation of death first appeared in the final chapter of sandman s first story arc preludes and nocturnes the sound of her wings issue 8 where she gave dream direction and a degree of understanding death instantly became very popular with readers and she appears at least briefly in each of the nine subsequent story arcs however gaiman attempted to entice and tease readers by rationing out the number of appearances from dream s family so death did not appear as frequently as one might expect for such a popular character at the end of the ninth sandman story arc the kindly ones there is a lengthy and noteworthy appearance from death in which she finally brings her brother peace character design edit according to gaiman the initial visual design of death was based on a friend of dringenberg s named cinamon hadley 8 from the sandman companion cinamon sin hadley the inspiration for death death is the only major character whose visuals didn t spring from me that credit goes to mike dringenberg in my original sandman outline i suggested death look like rock star nico in 1968 with the perfect cheekbones and perfect face she has on the cover of her chelsea girl album but mike dringenberg had his own ideas so he sent me a drawing based on a woman he knew named cinamon hadley 9 the drawing that was later printed in sandman 11 and i looked at it and had the immediate reaction of wow that s really cool later that day dave mckean and i went to dinner in chelsea at the my old dutch pancake house and the waitress who served us was a kind of vision she was american had long black hair was dressed entirely in black black jeans t shirt etc and wore a big silver ankh on a silver necklace and she looked exactly like mike dringenberg s drawing of death hadley died from colon cancer at the age of 48 on january 6 2018 10 11 mckean also used a series of professional english models for representations of death on covers of sandman 12 despite some rumors death is not based on gaiman s friend tori amos 13 fictional character biography edit new earth edit death is the second eldest of the endless 14 a family of anthropomorphic beings 2 death is possibly the most powerful of the endless and one of the most powerful beings in the universe followed closely by beings like lucifer morningstar slightly less powerful than the presence having been shown in a flashback in brief lives to be virtually omniscient and being able to intimidate the furies who show no fear of the other endless simply by raising her voice in the kindly ones the witch thessaly mentions that death is the only one of the endless who is bound by no rules supported in dream s portion of endless nights in which she briefly makes an appearance at a conference designed to set functions for entities and leaves before it begins in addition it is mentioned in brief lives that she is the only one of the endless who may survive the end of this incarnation of the universe death s realm is not portrayed in detail in the series except for a brief scene in her house in the sandman special song of orpheus and later in the books of magic series this is where she keeps her floppy hat collection her goldfish slim and wandsworth and possibly her gallery a brief glimpse of her realm can also be seen in the little endless storybook when barnabas visits her although this time in her apartment suite one day every century death lives and dies as a mortal in order to understand the value of the life she takes she does this by becoming a mortal fated to die that day at the end of death the high cost of living her endless self briefly converses with her mortal self dc rebirth edit death appeared in her grim reaper form in harley quinn comic book vol 3 63 powers and abilities edit death is an immortal being of virtual omnipotence omniscience and omnipresence she is not a god of death or agent of it but death itself the end of life as for the end of her role death has said when the last living thing dies my job will be finished i ll put the chairs on the tables turn out the lights and lock the universe behind me when i leave appearances edit death appeared in captain atom 42 43 june july 1990 in which she appeared alongside the black racer as one of several aspects of death in the dc universe gaiman reportedly took issue with this depiction feeling that portraying her as merely an aspect of death diminished her importance 15 other giffen stories that feature death include the ambush bug nothing special one
