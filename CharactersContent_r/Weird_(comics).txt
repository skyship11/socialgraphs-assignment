years his people had been exploited as energy sources by a cruel race known as the macrolatts however for some unknown reason the weird did not share the docile acceptance of the rest of his race when

a corporeal form to contain his energy he possessed the body of a dead man named walter langley this produced a composite form which contained both the weird s memories and traces of langley s in this shape he sought out earth s superheroes for aid and was dubbed the weird by the blue beetle with the heroes assistance he was able to repel the macrolatt invasion tragically his victory was short

resurrection and to seek out comet the other whose memories now mingle with his own to this end he has sought answers within the extraterrestrial church the eternal light corporation though he has
