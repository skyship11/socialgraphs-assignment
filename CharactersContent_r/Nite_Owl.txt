pet owl in t h white s novel the once and future king equipped with a variety of offensive and defensive devices such as flamethrowers and screechers devices capable of producing a sharp screech like sound dreiberg as nite owl met fellow costumed adventurer rorschach who suggested they partner to take on organized crime the two became not only a team but also best friends he supported the idea of costumed vigilantes forming a group to fight crime strategically but rorschach and the comedian rejected the idea having already come to understand that his expensive activities were too limited in scope to make any real difference dreiberg retired after the passing of the keene act on august 3 1977 in 1985 when the story takes place he seemed to regret his decision to give up crime fighting having no sense of personal fulfillment without it rorschach said regarding his retirement no staying power following the keene act dreiberg contributed scholarly articles to ornithological journals
