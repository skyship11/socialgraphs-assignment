the multiverse edit with the introduction of dc s multiverse system the continuity of golden age superman stories and the ultra humanite were retroactively placed on earth two the earth of dc s golden age characters the ultra humanite was reintroduced during the silver age as a recurring villain in the mr and mrs superman feature in the superman family anthology comic the feature consists of
