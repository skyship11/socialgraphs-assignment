described a handsome toothy character named glorious godfrey a revivalist godfrey is drawn to look like an actor playing billy graham in a hollywood film biography of richard nixon starring george hamilton 3 the character was intended to embody the powerful charismatic speaker who could talk people into justifying violence and evil 4 fictional character biography edit godfrey has a sister named amazing grace who is also a member of darkseid s elite the siblings have similar powers whereas amazing grace s specialty is manipulation godfrey s is persuasion 5 in his first appearance he confronts the forever people who had stumbled upon a recruitment program for earth based warriors for darkseid he personally leads an attack of justifiers that almost kills the young warrior serafin despite the efforts of the forever people s semi sentient super cycle godfrey s attack would have succeeded in killing serafin however highfather chose at that moment to recall all his people and the cycle home via teleportation 6 godfrey remained a relatively unimportant character until 1986 he had a total of three appearances over a decade and a half when legends the first crossover since the crisis on infinite earths was published in it darkseid attempts to deprive the world of its heroes not only so that they would be ineffective against darkseid but also in the hopes that the people of earth would more willingly surrender to his rule g gordon godfrey artist john byrne the first phase of the plan consists simply of creating immense amounts of collateral damage by sending creatures to earth to fight the superheroes the public begins to resent the heroes in their midst and therefore darkseid starts the second phase of his plan by sending the master manipulator glorious godfrey to earth assuming the identity of g gordon godfrey a reference to g gordon liddy he starts a hate campaign against the superheroes that proves to be very effective riling the public and ultimately leading to a presidential decision to outlaw any super heroic activity the final phase of the plan consists of the apokoliptian warhounds cybernetic creatures that are bonded to human hosts for which godfrey is able to find an ample number of volunteers among his hypnotized public he leads his charges to washington d c only to be confronted by a cadre of assembled heroes 2 the heroes are able to defeat the warhounds and separate them from their human hosts with godfrey jeopardising his image when he strikes a little girl who had been standing between the heroes and godfrey s group of adults after his initial weak attempt to justify his attack fails godfrey makes one last ploy by putting on the helmet of doctor fate in the hopes of obtaining his awesome might instead the helmet mindwipes godfrey leaving him nothing more than an empty shell he is sent to belle reve sanitarium which he would later be broken out of by the female furies under the order of darkseid godfrey has subsequently made brief appearances among assemblages of all the apokoliptian gods final crisis edit in final crisis 1 reverend godfrey good appears on a tv news report decrying the situation in bl√ºdhaven and the lack of government aid and assistance in dealing with the crisis in the ruined city 7 in between final crisis 1 and 2 good is captured and transformed into a host for the essence of glorious godfrey godfrey taunts dan turpin and batman as batman is imprisoned and turpin transformed into the final host body for darkseid in final crisis 4 godfrey is present when darkseid takes control over turpin s body however in final crisis 5 darkseid responds to his minion s impending death presumably due to the fact that godfrey s host body was not modified to successfully contain godfrey s dark essence by watching them die in front of him 8 a one shot revealed that godfrey had been chosen by darkseid to be the secretive personal assistant to the earth based villain libra the man is given generic technology to support him throughout the years because darkseid believed the man had potential for greatness godfrey s assistance turns out to be invaluable as libra is the key to darkseid s defeat of earth 9 the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe glorious godfrey makes his first appearance by giving greetings to batman and ra s al ghul from apokolips he has a new look sporting a beard and an all black uniform with red gloves and belt 10 glorious godfrey s reason for coming to earth is to retrieve the chaos shard a powerful crystal which once belonged to darkseid which ra s al ghul revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for damian after detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside damian s body and despite the assistance of the justice league glorious godfrey escapes with the corpse back to apokolips with batman vowing to get damian wayne s corpse back 11 powers and abilities edit glorious godfrey retains several attributes of a native of apokolips such as a limited level of superhuman strength endurance and invulnerability in addition godfrey has extended lifespan which allows him to exist indefinitely and he has an advanced immune system however glorious godfrey is a sub par athlete and hand to hand combatant whose greatest gifts are his overwhelming speaking voice and his extraordinary powers of persuasion whether these are natural gifts or have been augmented by the power of darkseid has yet to be determined godfrey employs a private army called the justifiers composed of earthmen who believe godfrey s rhetoric and have had their perceptions completely contorted by godfrey s words the special helmets worn by the justifiers allow glorious godfrey to control his soldiers even when they are not in his presence inspiration edit jack kirby biographer mark evanier states that glorious godfrey was based on evangelist billy graham a lesser villain who toiled in the service of darkseid was inspired more directly by evangelist billy graham who was then rather difficult to avoid on tv kirby was appalled at some of graham s apocalyptic sermons which to jack were more calculated to instill fear than faith and to stampede people into service of graham s causes jack called the foe glorious godfrey the name being a kirbyesque pun the comic book evangelist was god free and also had some of the traits of tv pitchman arthur godfrey though the main reference and the visual came from billy graham not evident in on the pages he drew was jack s belief which he expressed on several occasions that graham and the president he counseled were both virulent anti semites 12 in other media edit television edit glorious g gordon godfrey appears in the justice league two part
