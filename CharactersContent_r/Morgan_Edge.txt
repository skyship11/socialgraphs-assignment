kirby 2 kirby based his physical appearance on actor kevin mccarthy while his personality was inspired by television executive james t aubrey 3 according to kirby s production assistant mark evanier kirby wanted to explore the theme of organized crime gaining a foothold in corporate america particularly a giant media conglomerate given the shady background of the company that acquired warner bros and dc it was something of an inside joke 3 however under prodding from editorial staff who preferred edge to be an ongoing supporting character rather than a villain who would ultimately have to be brought to justice and thus written out of the series the morgan edge connected to intergang was revealed to be an imposter 3 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in his original incarnation edge was the president of the galaxy broadcasting system owners of television station wgbs the media corporation which eventually bought the daily planet edge was in many ways a stereotype of a ruthless capitalist intervening in the planet s homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older perry white but he was a decent man who had moments of good heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees including clark kent following the takeover of the planet edge transferred kent to the news division making him a traveling correspondent and later anchorman on wgbs this move added several tv co workers to the superman supporting cast including fretful producer josh coyle sports broadcaster steve lombard 4 weather forecaster oscar asherman and co anchor lana lang who had been one of clark s childhood friends in smallville as one of the wealthiest men in metropolis edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered superman the subject of many of his network s news stories whom he like most others failed to realize was also clark kent although rarely integral to a plotline edge was a supporting character in many superman stories for a while it appeared that edge was connected to the apokolips sponsored crime organisation intergang but this was revealed to be a clone created by the evil factory a genetics laboratory working for darkseid 5 for example this clone attempted to have jimmy olsen the guardian and incidentally a random daily planet employee named goody rickels a don rickles lookalike murdered as part of a cover up 6 it was later revealed that morgan edge s birth name was morris edelstein after he won his first tv station in a game of poker morris edelstein changed his name to morgan edge because he was ashamed of his lower class jewish background and kept the details of his past closely guarded 7 post crisis edit when dc continuity was rebooted after the crisis on infinite earths edge remained president of wgbs but his ties to the planet and friendship with superman were retconned away and he was genuinely connected to intergang he was eventually exposed by the daily planet in articles by clark kent and cat grant who was working for wgbs undercover edge was imprisoned but even managed to cause trouble there by publishing his autobiography on the edge which dumped upon his father vincent edge as well as cat grant revealing that she slept her way into a scoop after his release from jail morgan edge returned as sponsor of the superman revenge squad prior to his imprisonment one of his actions generated much fan anger in which edge sadistically and gleefully ran over a raccoon on the road prompting one fan to write in saying lex luthor treats people like animals but even he does not run them over intentionally recently morgan edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit with the show edge of reason where he gives off anti kryptonian spin for general lane he is also seen in a flash forward panel in adventure comics vol 2 1 making a mysterious deal with despero 8 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe morgan edge appears as a powerful and self centered media mogul and the new owner of the daily planet he is seen as the sponsor of the challengers of the unknown program before they all leave
