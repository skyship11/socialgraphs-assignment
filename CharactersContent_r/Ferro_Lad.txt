appeared in adventure comics 346 and was created by jim shooter 2 when jim shooter first created the character he intended ferro lad to be black but editor mort weisinger vetoed the idea 3 saying we ll lose our distribution in the south 4 this was in fact one reason why shooter chose ferro lad to be the one to die in the sun eater story in a 2003 interview shooter said ferro lad i killed because my plan was that he was a black guy and mort weisinger said no then i said well let s see i ve got this idea for a story and someone needs to die ah ha him so basically i killed him off because it annoyed me that i couldn t do with him what i wanted 5 however in a 2011 blog post he had a different explanation i thought mort might object if i killed an established long term legionnaire but what if it was one of the new ones i d created maybe that would fly so i did it i didn t ask i just did it why ferro lad because his powers suited the opportunity how would princess projectra or even karate kid survive the death run into the heart of the sun eater 6 shooter made double sure that ferro lad would stay dead by setting the next issue ten years in the future in which a statue of ferro lad is on display in the legion s hall of the honored dead 6 the life and death of ferro lad isbn 978 1 4012 2193 5 a hardcover trade paperback collecting the silver age appearances of ferro lad was released in 2009 fictional character biography edit silver age edit andrew nolan is a metahuman with the power to transform himself into living iron 7 he has a twin brother named douglas who has the same power both twins have deformed faces as a side effect of the mutation that gave them their powers so both wear iron masks he first appears in adventure comics 346 july 1966 he joined at the same time as princess projectra karate kid and nemesis kid ferro lad was only a legionnaire for a short time when he was killed destroying the sun eater with a bomb in adventure comics 353 his self sacrifice to save the galaxy made him legendary despite his short tenure as a legionnaire with many later silver age stories featuring references to his death both the event itself and a statue erected in his memory was often visible in the legion s headquarters he next appears in adventure comics 357 june 1967 but as a ghost seemingly saving a number of his former teammates from a controller representative of a race of superior beings many years later during the five year gap following the magic wars earth fell under the covert control of the dominators and withdrew from the united planets some time thereafter the members of the dominators highly classified batch sw6 escaped captivity originally batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenage legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken just prior to ferro lad s death at the hands of the sun eater later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts after earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 8 a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as new earth the sw6 legionnaires remained and their version of ferro lad shortened his code name to ferro post zero hour edit in post zero hour continuity he is known as ferro and comes from 20th century earth born in the 20th century andrew nolan and his twin douglas were the sons of a famous actress nancy nolan who abandoned them because of their grotesque facial deformities 1 9 left in the care of an unscrupulous scientist called doc 30 he escaped while douglas remained behind when the earth was dying due to the extinguishing of the sun in the so called final night he first helps perry white who was determined the daily planet would not miss one day of delivery then he becomes involved with the legion of super heroes who had become stranded in the present day this team joins with dozens of other superheroes to help try to save the earth ferro comes close to heroically sacrificing his life in an effort to stop the sun eater at the last instant he is saved by hal jordan who was maintaining the power and identity of parallax jordan seemingly sacrifices his own life and the sun is restored ferro remains with the team although it was some time before they informed him they were from the 31st century 1 when the legion were able to return to their home time ferro went with them and served with them for some time until several of the team were lost in a rift and the remainder ordered to disband after this he went with karate kid to a monastery on the planet steeple a planet only accessible for short periods every ten years before a black hole prevented access once more while there he finally learned to deal with his deformity but he was savagely beaten by an escaped convict and while the monks were able to save his life he was trapped in iron form with the helmet he wore fused to his face moreover he and karate kid who had refused to leave his friend behind were now trapped on the planet for ten years citation needed brainiac 5 was able to use the threshold technology he had learned of during his time lost to open a path to steeple but before anyone could use it he along with all of the legion bar sensor and shikari and several whole planets were entranced by universo citation needed sensor and shikari were forced to use the unstable link to steeple to escape and the four of them were able to free saturn girl who with aid from apparition and ultra boy s child cub was able to defeat universo while ferro and karate kid rejoined the team citation needed the lightning saga edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics andrew is depicted as a member of this version of the team in justice society of america vol 3 5 june 2007 and action comics 858 late december 2007 however this incarnation of the legion shares roughly the same history as the original legion up to the events of crisis on infinite earths 10 therefore this version of andrew is presumably deceased powers edit ferro lad had the superhuman ability to transform his body into a nearly indestructible isotope of iron unlike stone boy ferro lad had full mobility and could think and speak normally his iron like form could resist considerable damage including direct hits by laser blasts and he was able to survive unprotected in the vacuum of space he could use his ability offensively by ramming his iron hard body into an opponent or an obstacle his physical strength also increased when in his iron state allowing him to bend metal bars or reshape scrap metal like clay equipment edit as a member of the legion of super heroes he was provided a legion flight ring it allowed him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments he also had a radio built into his mask which allowed him to communicate with others while in airless space other versions edit in legion of super heroes vol 2 300 an alternate universe is glimpsed by andrew nolan s brother douglas here it
