split into multiple aspects with the roman gods existing for a time as separate entities zeus counterpart jupiter rules his own olympus in a separate dimension following this the two pantheons are merged into single entities again centuries later in present day zeus has been a benefactor of the amazons the last remaining people that still worship the olympians however his patriarchal attitudes disregard for mortals and unreasonable demands have sometimes led to conflict with his followers particularly their champion wonder woman after wonder woman s defeat of ares which caused the latter to go into self exile zeus becomes interested in diana and wants her virginity offering to make her a goddess diana becomes the first woman ever to refuse his advances while professing love for him as god and father enraged at being rejected zeus threatens her but is summoned back to olympus by hera at the urging at the goddesses who created the amazons and are incensed themselves at zeus for
