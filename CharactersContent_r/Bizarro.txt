october 1958 but on sale in august 2 writer otto binder casting the character as a frankenstein s monster pastiche that possessed all the powers of superboy 3 shunned for his unenviable appearance the teen version of bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story an adult version appeared around the same time in the superman daily newspaper comic strip written by alvin schwartz debuting in episode 105 the battle with bizarro strips 6147 6242 august 25 1958 to december 13 1958 according to comics historian mark evanier schwartz long claimed that he originated the bizarro concept prior to the character s appearance in superboy 4 the newspaper storyline introduced the strange speech patterns that became synonymous with the character with all of bizarro s comments meaning the opposite e g bad means good the newspaper version wore a b on his chest as opposed to superman s distinctive s 5 schwartz stated 6 i was striving you might say for that mirror image that opposite and out of a machine which would reveal the negative superman came the mirror image always remembering that in a mirror everything is reversed the times were such that one dimensional characters your standard superheroes even in comics seemed rather simplistic like paper cut outs what was demanded was the full dimensional personality a figure that carried a shadow if you like i was certainly inspired to some degree also by c g jung s archetype of the shadow and bizarro certainly reflected that as well binder introduced the adult version of the character into the superman comic book this time wearing an s in action comics 254 july 1959 7 bizarro proved popular and eventually starred in a bizarro world feature in adventure comics for fifteen issues running from issue 285 299 june 1961 august 1962 8 as well as in a special all bizarro 80 page giant superman 202 december 1967 january 1968 the character made forty appearances 9 in the superman family of titles action comics superman superman s pal jimmy olsen superman s girl friend lois lane adventure comics secret society of super villains and dc comics presents from 1959 to 1984 prior to a reboot of the dc universe as a result of the limited series crisis on infinite earths 1 12 april 1985 march 1986 bizarro was reintroduced into the dc universe in a one off appearance with characterization similar to his original superboy appearance in superman the man of steel 5 december 1986 he was later revived in the bizarro s world serial that ran through the superman titles in march and april 1994 and in action comics annual 8 in 1996 an unrelated four issue limited series titled a bizarro july october was published in 1999 yet another version was introduced during the emperor joker storyline in september october 2000 remaining in dc comics continuity this bizarro continued to make semi regular guest appearances that firmly established the character as part of the superman mythos fictional character biography edit pre crisis bizarro edit general zod s bizarro army edit general dru zod had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet krypton the bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation this was the reason why zod was banished to the phantom zone for 25 krypton sun cycles 10 bizarro superboy edit some 12 years later totally oblivious to these facts a scientist on earth is demonstrating his newly invented duplicating ray to superboy and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero the copy quickly labeled bizarro is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior shunned by the people of smallville bizarro befriends a blind girl named melissa and loses all hope when he realizes that the girl did not shun or flee from him because she was blind superboy is eventually forced to kill the less than perfect clone using the remains of the duplicating machine which acts like blue kryptonite as opposed to green kryptonite superboy s weakness on the copy the whole business proved unexpectedly easy as bizarro deliberately destroyed himself by colliding with the duplicating machine s fragment the ensuing explosion miraculously restores melissa s eyesight 11 bizarro 1 edit years afterward superman s arch foe lex luthor recreates the duplicating ray and uses it on the hero hoping to control the duplicate that became known as bizarro 1 the bizarro that is created however is confused stating me not human me not creature me not even animal me unhappy me don t belong in world of living people me don t know difference between right and wrong good and evil 6 luthor is arrested by bizarro for re creating him but forgotten as bizarro attempts to emulate superman creating havoc in the city of metropolis and almost exposing superman s secret identity as clark kent when bizarro falls in love with reporter lois lane she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a bizarro lois who is instantly attracted to bizarro in addition he also used the duplicating ray on himself to create new bizarro who later dies from exposure to green kryptonite the bizarros leave earth together determined to find a home where they can be themselves 12 superman encounters the couple once again discovering that bizarro now called bizarro 1 has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of bizarros who now reside on a cube shaped planet called htrae earth spelled backwards 13 bizarro 1 and bizarro lois 1 also give birth to a child who while super powered appears to be totally human considered a freak by bizarro standards out of resentment for the way he was treated by earth humans bizarro 1 made a law that they must act the opposite of humans causing no end of lunacy the child is the catalyst for a brief war between htrae and earth 14 blue kryptonite is also invented during this war as well as the temporary existence of bizarro supergirl bizarro also has a series of adventures on htrae aiding a normal jimmy olsen when he is accidentally trapped there 15 preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues 16 and stopping the bizarro version of titano 17 bizarro s influence is also felt on earth jimmy olsen is inadvertently turned into a bizarro for a while 18 and a new teen version of bizarro travels to the 30th century and attempts to join the legion of super heroes when he is rejected by the legion the bizarro teen creates his own bizarro version of the legion which superboy eventually persuades him to disband 19 when bizarro encounters superman once again his powers are now the opposite of superman s such as freeze vision as opposed to heat vision and heat breath rather than freeze breath and he attempts to kidnap lois lane 20 bizarro also temporarily joins the secret society of super villains to battle the justice league of america and captain comet 21 22 bizarro appears in the alan moore scripted whatever happened to the man of tomorrow in superman 423 september 1986 bizarro goes berserk and destroys the bizarro world and its inhabitants then travels to metropolis and wreaks havoc before abruptly committing suicide this and many other deaths turn out to be the machinations of mister mxyzptlk who had begun a rampage of crime superman is unable to undo the deaths but kills mxyzptlk and then uses gold kryptonite on himself bizarro s final pre crisis appearance was in dc comics presents 97 september 1986 which was also the final issue of that series after being empowered by a hideously disfigured phantom zone sorcerer mr mxyzptlk destroys zrfff and then causes the bizarro world to implode killing all its inhabitants bizarro s severed head crashes onto clark kent s desk and addresses clark kent before his simulated life ends bizarro does not appear in the crisis on infinite earths apparently because of this story s events this story directly contradicts a world s finest story where it is revealed that sometime in the future htrae is transformed into a more normal world egg shaped rather than cubical by the radiation from an exploding celestial body the bizarros are changed into normal people without powers but still retain vestiges of their bizarro laws curtains hung outside the windows of a house etc 23 post crisis edit project changeling edit after the events of crisis on infinite earths lex luthor orders his scientific team to create a clone of superman that was part of project changeling incorrectly starting from the assumption that superman is a human with metahuman abilities his alien origin had not yet been revealed the process results in a flawed copy which luthor dismissively refers to as this bizarre oh forget it before ordering for the subject to be disposed of the clone survives and although mute and possessed of only limited intelligence and vague memories of clark kent s life attempts to mimic superman he kidnaps lois lane and is finally destroyed when colliding with superman in mid air 24 each time he exerted himself the clone crumbled slightly when lois lane s sister who had been blinded in a terrorist attack is exposed to bizarro s dust she regains her sight while superman had not expected this effect he speculated that bizarro heard the sister explain her partial recovery and may have deliberately allowed himself to be killed in order to cure her 24 bizarro ii edit a second bizarro able to speak and think better due to genetic engineering by luthor appears in a 5 issue substory in the clone plague story arc titled bizarro s world beginning in superman vol 2 87 before he died this bizarro seriously injured dr sydney happersen kidnapped lois created a ramshackle dummy version of metropolis in a warehouse to parody superman s frequently rescuing lois he deliberately exposed her to and rescued her from one lethal danger after another abducted lana lang proposed to lois and finally died in luthor s labs 25 during this period superman also had to cope with an unending increase in his powers due to exposure to purple kryptonite in the climax of the death of superman and reign of the supermen story arcs 26 match edit main article match dc comics project cadmus s 01 edit s 01 coined bizarre o is the first of the paul westfield overseen attempts to clone a new superman by him during

released after breaking free of his stasis pod s 01 rapidly started deteriorating with his skin almost immediately taking on the chalky huge and ridged texture of other bizarros 27 dabney donovan s bizarro edit one other bizarro is created using lex luthor s clone process by lex luthor s estranged wife contessa portenza and dabney donovan shortly after superman regained his normal powers when he expended his electromagnetic ones this bizarro abducted lex luthor s baby daughter and intended to send her by rocket to another planet emulating kal el s escape from krypton his pile of explosives and bombs meant to launch the rocket would have killed her instead and superman had to shield her when bizarro threw the launch switch bizarro iii already self destructing from a genetic booby trap encoded into him by his creator perished in the explosion 28 joker s bizarro bizarro 1 edit another version of bizarro possesses all the abilities of superman but with a childlike mentality and method of speech he is created by batman s arch enemy the joker when the villain steals the powers of the fifth dimensional imp mister mxyzptlk creating a twisted version of earth called jokerworld a perfect cube with joker s image on each facet the villain designates bizarro to be the planet s greatest hero and leader of a reimagined jla the joker s league of anarchy when mxyzptlk regains his powers the

hell after killing trigon and plans to be the ruler of hell to make sure earth is not in danger before saying goodbye to jason todd and artemis 53 powers and abilities edit generally bizarro s powers are identical to superman with the most substantial difference being that are reverse versions of certain abilities arctic vision unleashes twin beams of subzero light from his eyes which instantaneously freezes anything or anyone on contact inducing frostbite and even hypothermia flame breath allows him to exhale a superheated napalm like substance which causes severe burns with minimal contact and even melt steel at maximum intensity vacuum breath instead of wind breath he can inhale large amounts of air to draw people and objects towards him bizarro telescopic vision which allows bizarro to see a short distance behind his head rather than a long distance in front of his head bizarro microscopic vision which makes objects actually smaller to everyone rather than merely appear to be bigger to only the user bizarro x ray vision which allows bizarro to only see through lead rather than the ability to see through anything except lead spotlight vision which allows bizarro to project beams of light in the fashion of a spotlight from his eyes to highlight what he is looking at x ray hearing which allows bizarro to hear through everything except lead when operating within an environment under a blue sun bizarro gains the ability to replicate new lifeforms from his own body mass using this power he cloned a cube shaped planet that has become colloquially known as htrae this world is now populated by bizarro versions of superman his family friends and enemies 54 55 56 similarly bizarro s weaknesses are reversed kryptonite has an empowering effect on him healing and strengthening his body similar to the effects of yellow sunlight on superman while only blue kryptonite an imperfect duplicate of green kryptonite affects bizarro adversely in the same manner that this former does with normal kryptonians causing him debilitating pain and diminishing his superpowers other versions edit all star superman edit the limited series all star superman january 2006 october 2008 features bizarro clones from an alternative universe called the underverse they can infect a normal human and change them into a bizarro clone by touch 57 one of these creatures is called zibarro and is unique in that he has intellect and a roughly human appearance traits which he considered to be sources of scorn from his fellow bizarros resulting in a social isolation and loneliness he attempted to combat through artwork when superman was stranded in the underverse zibarro helped him marshal the other bizarros into building a rocketship that could send kal el home zibarro briefly considered taking superman s place in the rocket but realized he had no way of knowing he would find any more acceptance among humans than his kinsmen before leaving superman advised him that rather than an aberration zibarro may be evidence of increasing intelligence on the part of bizarro home and encouraged him to keep up his work superman had a segment of zibarro s poetry preserved in superlaminite within his fortress of solitude after returning home 58 amalgam comics edit in the amalgam comics reality an amalgamation of bizarro and carnage bizarnage was made through a botched experiment at project cadmus in an attempt to replicate alien dna the white goopy creature they created went crazy and began destroying everything and everyone in its way then spider boy arrived and battled him while bizarnage wanted to be spider boy so he tried insanely to kill him but was eventually defeated by getting tricked by spider boy and sucked into an energy containment unit superboy comics edit bizarro appears in an issue of the tie in comic for the late 1980s superboy tv show in which he is duped into acting as a student s art project 59 he also was

superman 1 stops them saying that killing is the earthly thing that they must above all do the opposite of realizing that however strange the bizarro world might be its inhabitants are safer and happier than those of earth thanks to bizarro 1 s leadership superman apologizes to show his sincerity he hides a copy of the bizarro code where nobody will ever see it the people hold a parade in 1 s honor and with his loving wife bizarro lois 1 and their son bizarro junior 1 at his side bizarro cries saying me am happiest creature in universe when the technician finishes reading the story he sees

by an amish family years ago lex luthor uses dna samples to create bizarro like duplicates which he disguises as the liberator robots to hunt down the supposedly rogue metahumans 74 while the liberators possess superman s powers in terms of strength and speed their genetic structure proves to be unstable to the point that they collapse after sustaining even minor damage in combat with metahuman foes the league observe in the final battle that the liberators relied on stealth and superior numbers to overwhelm their captives as they could never have won in prolonged combat injustice gods among us edit in the prequel comic to the video game lex luthor comes up with the idea of creating a clone of superman that can combat the corrupt man of steel however the clone escapes before the process can be completed resulting in the clone having gray skin and diminished mental capacity the clone travels to germany where he meets a man who confuses it with superman making the clone assume this is his identity giving the clone a superman suit with the s backwards the clone goes on to try to establish peace but because he lacks common sense and a basic understanding of human ways he inadvertently wreaks havoc and kills weather wizard and heatwave the trickster is able to take advantage of the clone s mental limitation to convince him they are friends and the imposter superman is his enemy the clone becomes known to the regime with superman meeting him as solomon grundy is being captured yellow lantern gives him the name bizarro since he proves to be an imperfect clone of superman bizarro gets away before they can discover his origin trickster has difficulty keeping the clone in check as the clone ends up killing an entire restaurant of civilians when he misunderstands trickster s instructions trickster resolves to be more specific but bizarro accidentally drops him during flight leading to trickster s death not comprehending death bizarro takes trickster s corpse to the german man who helped him the man calls the regime for aid so bizarro returns to the first place he remembers luthor s laboratory luthor realizes that the clone will inadvertently expose his work so he sends bizarro to the fortress of solitude nominally for answers but in reality to be ambushed by the luthor controlled doomsday this leads to a fierce fight between the two which is interrupted when the actual superman arrives the three way battle tears across the arctic with luthor trying to prolong it by repeatedly switching doomsday s assigned target but he eventually realizes that he can t bring himself to murder even the corrupted clark and that bizarro can t live to reveal luthor s double agency when superman is briefly incapacitated luthor turns doomsday on the unsuspecting clone and succeeds in killing him before having the monster stand down superman furious takes bizarro s corpse to luthor to run tests not realizing his ally s complicity in other media edit television edit live action edit tom welling as bizarro as seen in the 2007 smallville episode bizarro bizarro appears in superboy portrayed by barry meyers this version is inspired by the silver age comics incarnation and was created after superboy was exposed to an experimental duplicating ray that was overcharged during a lightning storm after going on a rampage the double adopts the alias of kent clark falls in love with and becomes violently possessive of lana lang before being healed by duplicated kryptonite following his first appearance he is manipulated by lex luthor into attacking superboy via a duplicated lang who convinces bizarro to thwart luthor and is temporarily rendered human by an experimental process meant to copy superboy s brainwaves to his own brain and extensive plastic surgery before bizarro is forced to reverse the process to save the weakened superboy throughout the series a childlike clone akin to bizarro appears in the lois and clark the new adventures of superman season one episode vatman portrayed by dean cain similarly to the post crisis incarnation this version was created and raised by lex luthor to challenge superman however lois lane and clark kent help the clone realize his true nature the clone goes on to destroy luthor s lab and the dna sample used to create him before flying off calling superman his brother bizarro appears in smallville portrayed by tom welling as a major antagonist during season six and seven introduced in the season six premiere this version is a phantom wraith that came about as the result of a kryptonian experiment that was imprisoned in the phantom zone until clark kent accidentally releases it upon discovering it cannot survive outside of the phantom zone on its own the wraith survives by possessing human hosts though they only last for 24 hours before the host dies forcing it to change hosts before then the wraith continues this pattern for months until it steals part of kent s dna
