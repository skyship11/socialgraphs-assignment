bat mite and mr mxyzptlk in the bizarro comics anthology mxyzptlk s native fifth dimension seemed to include beings similar to bat mite and johnny thunder s thunderbolt neither of these comics are considered canonical however in a justice league justice society of america crossover in justice league and in justice society of america 78 80 it was revealed that both mxyzptlk and thunderbolt come from the fifth dimension letter columns and writer interviews suggest that bat mite comes from there as well although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves in the post crisis issue superman batman 25 it was revealed that the joker had gained fifth dimensional powers by maintaining the essence of mr mxyzptlk from the earlier emperor joker storyline at the end bizarro was able to extract this latent magical essence from the joker which manifested in a form recognizable as bat mite as such a bat mite has been fully reestablished into the current continuity as an outgrowth of mr mxyzptlk incubated within the joker 8 the first post infinite crisis appearance of bat mite was in batman 672 written by grant morrison 9 batman is confronted with bat mite or might

increasing delusions he then counsels the zur en arrh batman a back up personality manufactured by bruce himself to keep batman able to fight in case he was mindwiped or driven to insanity batman 680 reveals that might is indeed a product of batman s imagination representing the last vestiges of batman s rational mind within the zur en arrh batman although when asked by batman whether he is an extra dimensional being or a figment of his imagination bat mite responds that the fifth dimension is imagination 11 in superman batman 52 bat mite appears having had a bet with mr mxyzptlk similar to
