biography edit silver age edit brainiac s first appearance in action comics 242 july 1958 art by curt swan and stan kaye the first brainiac kandor comic book story in action comics 242 july 1958 was based on a story arc in the superman comic strip from april through august 1958 in the comic strip story superman s foe was named romado who traveled the cosmos with a white alien monkey named koko shrinking major cities and keeping them in glass jars the strip s kryptonian bottled city was named dur el va 4 this cross continuity conflict was not unprecedented in 1958 and 59 editor mort weisinger used the comic strip to prototype a number of concepts that he planned to introduce in the book including bizarro and red kryptonite 5 brainiac is a bald green skinned humanoid who arrives on earth and shrinks various cities including metropolis storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the then unnamed planet he ruled 6 he was originally notable only for having shrunk the bottle city of kandor with his shrinking ray and for using a force field 7 in his initial story he also traveled with a white alien monkey named koko the monkey also appears in a 1960 superman story retelling the story of kandor s disappearance superman 141 november 1960 koko was quickly dropped from brainiac s stories but a version of the monkey has made sporadic appearances as the villain s pet in the series justice and the 2008 storyline brainiac in action comics the villain s descendant brainiac 5 also had a pet named koko for several stories in the 1990s in subsequent appearances in this early period brainiac was used mostly as a plot device rather than as a featured villain of the month brainiac s next appearance was mostly behind the scenes when he tried to kill lois lane and lana lang prompting superman to give lois and lana superpowers but the villain remained unseen except as a plot twist at the end of the story brainiac s next appearance was in superman s return to krypton in superman 141 november 1960 in which the villain stole the bottle city of kandor the only city on krypton that believes jor el s warning of doom for the planet and which had already built a space ark within the city to save the population brainiac s next present day appearance was in action comics 275 april 1961 which showed the villain planning to defeat superman by exposing him to red green kryptonite which he had created giving superman a third eye on the back of his head forcing him to wear various hats to hide it superman soon defeated brainiac and sent him off into the distant past this was the first in story appearance of brainiac s iconic red diode electrode like objects atop his head which had previously appeared on the cover of his first appearance in action comics 242 july 1958 but were not shown in the actual story in superboy 106 july 1963 an infant superman meets brainiac and it is explained that brainiac looks the same due to his 200 year life span in superman 93 brainiac regenerates himself it is revealed that he came from a planet called bryak and after a voyage in space he returned to find everybody dead from a plague he intended to get people from other planets in shrunken cities to be enlarged with his growth ray to repopulate bryak where he would rule them brainiac s legacy was revealed in action comics 276 may 1961 in a legion of super heroes back up story this story introduced a green skinned blond haired teenager named querl dox brainiac 5 who claimed to be brainiac s 30th century descendant unlike his ancestor brainiac 5 used his twelfth level intellect for the forces of good and joined the legion alongside supergirl with whom he fell in love his home planet was given variously as bryak 8 yod yod colu or simply colu 8 9 10 11 20th century colu is a rim world found on the approach to the magellanic clouds the planet colu in superman 167 february 1964 it was retconned that brainiac was a robotic coluan entity created by the computer tyrants of colu to spy on and invade other worlds 12 brainiac s distinctive gridwork of red diodes on his head are explained as electric terminals of his sensory nerves necessary for him to function to explain the 1961 introduction of the villain s living descendant brainiac 5 the story reveals the computer tyrants provided the villain with an assistant a young coluan boy named vril dox tasked with masquerading as his son so others would believe brainiac to be a trustworthy organic alien scientist with a family rather than a deadly robot the young boy vril dox was designated brainiac 2 in the same issue the letter column contained a special announcement explaining that the change in the characterization of brainiac was in deference to the brainiac computer kit a toy computer created by edmund berkeley and based on the geniac that predated the creation of the comic book character 13 14 in this same story luthor discovers the computer tyrants could have given their robot villain a twelfth level intellect but only gave him a tenth level the same as them so he would not dominate them luthor frees brainiac from imprisonment and increases his intellect to a twelfth level one he also implants a device to temporarily disable him or destroy him if necessary the two join forces but brainiac later removes the device and blocks out luthor s memory of his inner workings and the fact that he is a machine this story becomes the first of many brainiac luthor team ups meanwhile vril dox leads a revolt against the computer tyrants eventually destroying them and freeing colu brainiac sees a monument to this when he returns to colu later on king kull later enlisted brainiac and mister atom of earth s to attack the city of tomorrow and speed up the rotation enough for the people of earth to fly into the air they are defeated by green lantern of earth two green lantern of earth one flash of earth two flash of earth one mercury of earth s and ibis the invincible of earth s 15 30th century pre crisis edit at some indeterminate point in time brainiac fled into the 30th century developing the ability to absorb and manipulate massive amounts of stellar energy he remade himself as pulsar stargrave a he became a powerful enemy of the legion of super heroes and once masqueraded as brainiac 5 s biological father 16 in current continuity brainiac s connection to pulsar stargrave remains an open question one even brainiac 5 has yet to resolve 17 bronze age edit brainiac s robotic incarnation in action comics 544 art by ed hannigan after being revealed to be a robotic being some brainiac stories would end with the villain seemingly destroyed only for him to appear again in a repaired body or having transmitted his consciousness into a new robotic form since he was essentially a living computer program that could be housed in different forms if killed brainiac was sometimes referred to on comic book covers as the villain who won t die in the 1980s dc comics attempted to re define several aspects of superman s stories to boost sagging sales in action comics 544 546 june august 1983 lex luthor acquires a renewed sense of purpose and dons a high tech warsuit while brainiac is reimagined by writer marv wolfman and artist gil kane and given a new appearance designed by ed hannigan in a previous story brainiac had constructed a giant computer controlled planet to destroy superman only to then be defeated by the hero and then trapped in the planet s core in wolfman and kane s story rebirth published in action comics 544 brainiac attempts to free himself by causing the nearby star epsilon 4 to go nova and utilize its energy instead his body is converted into energy his living program his consciousness experiences a strange journey before returning to his technology where a new body is created for him over the next few months as brainiac recollects during his journey he saw a great hand reach out from a void ensnaring him briefly before releasing him he also remembers seeing superman s face at the same time reborn in a new body the villain believes he has seen the master programmer the divine force behind the universe s creation and that this entity created superman as an angel of death to destroy brainiac more determined than ever to kill and study superman brainiac now has a colder more merciless and robot like personality than before he claims he is without emotions yet shows signs of hatred and fear in regards to superman his new body is overtly robotic with a skull like face and a reflective iridescent honeycomb patterned braincase he also creates a starship shaped like his new skull and adorned by metal tendrils often referred to by fans and comic creators as the skull ship the ship acts as an extension of brainiac himself brainiac retains this robotic appearance until after the crisis on infinite earths miniseries ends in 1986 rebooting dc comics continuity this incarnation of brainiac meets his final end in the whatever happened to the man of tomorrow storyline that ended the pre crisis silver bronze age superman chronology lex luthor finds brainiac s robotic head unit with barely any power left he hopes to team up with the evil living program again only to become an unwilling host body for brainiac instead fighting brainiac s control luthor begs a superpowered lana lang to kill him who complies by breaking his neck luthor dies and brainiac retains control of the body for a short time until rigor mortis sets in propelled by sheer malice brainiac s head unit leaves luthor s corpse and crawls a few inches before finally running out of power for good modern age edit in the post crisis dc universe brainiac s history was completely rewritten the post crisis version of brainiac was now a radical coluan scientist called vril dox who having attempted to overthrow the computer tyrants of colu was sentenced to death in his last moments before disintegration his consciousness was attracted light years away to milton moses fine a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias the amazing brainiac 18 needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of fine dox went on a murder spree he discovered that fine had genuine psychic powers and was thus a metahuman which he frequently wielded against superman 19 panic in the sky edit in 1990 brainiac is able to take over the minds of several lexcorp staffers he makes the scientists create a new version of the skull ship saying he thought of the design in a dream and use advanced genetic science to grow a new body for himself resembling milton fine s form but taller more physically fit and with the green skin of a coluan he also has a new braincase helmet that resembles his silver age diodes now free of fine s body and consciousness completely but still possessing the man s metahuman telepathic powers brainiac confronted superman and then left earth to plan another attack brainiac returned in the panic in the sky storyline after seizing control of the mobile planetary fortress warworld and recruiting assistance from maxima and the alien warrior draaga discovering a lost and confused matrix an artificial life form who at this time operates as supergirl brainiac brainwashes her into becoming his soldier he clashes with the new gods and then launches a pre emptive strike on earth 20 rather than wait for an invasion superman gathers a large group of superheroes and allies one team attacking warworld directly while the other remains on earth to counter further attacks 21 22 through duplicates of his braincase brainiac briefly takes control of some of earth s heroes but ultimately he fails supergirl and the other heroes are freed from mental control and the villain is rendered catatonic 23 his vegetative body is taken back to new genesis for observation 24 dead again edit a year after the seeming death and then return of superman a dead body matching the kryptonian s appearance is found in his abandoned tomb leading some to wonder if the hero s return was a deception 25 it is revealed that brainiac is no longer on new genesis but revived and returned to earth leaving behind an illusion that he remained in a coma while hidden he created more delusions to turn the public against superman and make the hero question his own sanity 26 the two battle and superman taunts the villain by insisting he is just milton moses fine a cheap entertainer fine s personality seemingly emerges and shuts down the brainiac persona fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility 27 the doomsday wars edit during a later skirmish with superman fine s body is irreparably damaged leaving brainiac with only a short time to live with help from a new coluan assistant named prin vnok brainiac retrieves doomsday the monster that seemingly killed superman before and uses him as a new host body now a cunning psychic with a super strong near indestructible body brainiac attacks the justice league but doomsday s own raging mind fights back and brainiac realizes he still needs a suitable host hoping to create a clone doomsday form by manipulating human dna brainiac attempts to steal a prematurely born baby superman is transporting to a neo natal intensive care unit the newborn child of pete ross and lana lang brainiac sees this as an opportunity for revenge correctly concluding that ross and lang are close to him using a psi blocker device superman thwarts brianiac s plans and the villain is forced to house his consciousness within a completely robotic body dubbing his new form brainiac 2 5 the villain fears he is now trapped in this form 28 brainiac 13 edit brainiac 13 art by ed mcguinness steve kim and tommy yune at the turn of the millennium brainiac 2 5 revealed that he had placed a sleeper virus in lexcorp s y2k bug safeguards this virus was intended to dramatically boost his abilities however the virus instead allowed his upgraded future self brainiac 13 or b 13 to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of brainiac 2 5 s body brainiac 13 then began transforming metropolis into the 64th century version of the city which he controlled and also began upgrading metallo into a giant sized version of himself brainiac 13 then took control of several android superheroes such as the red tornado and hourman and used them against superman the metal men s responsometers were able to protect them from his programming and allowed them to help defeat metallo during a fight with the eradicator who was attempting to hijack the b13 virus and use it for its own ends superman discovered that brainiac 13 could not cope with kryptonian technology due to incompatibility issues this gave superman a plan to stop brainiac 13 s scheme with the aid of the rebuilt kelex superman tricked luthor into connecting a kryptonian battlesuit to one of brainiac 13 s power conduits kelex then reactivated the red tornado to help superman break brainiac 13 down into his respective nanobots and trap him in the suit brainiac 13 was able to work with brainiac 2 5 now transferred into the aged body of lena luthor and prepared a tactic against imperiex for the upcoming imperiex war the brainiacs successfully engineered imperiex s defeat allowing brainiac 13 to absorb imperiex s power and use it to overpower the combined heroes and villains of the universe while simultaneously devastating both earth and apokolips brainiac 13 planned to use the power he stole from imperiex to conquer the universe and reshape it in his image and is made so powerful by the absorption that none of the heroes not even superman can hope to damage him 29 however with help from lex s temporal displacement technology and darkseid s boom tube technology boosted by magic supplied by tempest and the amazons superman was able to destroy brainiac 13 and imperiex by sending them through a temporal boom tube where they were annihilated in the big bang brainiac 13 had his body disintegrated and the remnants of his mind scattered across sixty trillion light years finally killing the chronologically last known version of brainiac 30 after the death of brainiac 13 superman discovered that the version of krypton he previously visited via the phantom zone was in fact a trap created by brainiac 13 having been defeated by kryptonian technology brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real krypton prior to its destruction there he stole the eradicator matrix and jor el s diaries and created a false krypton based on jor el s favorite period in history 31 sometime later superman traveled into the future and battled brainiac 12 he learned that everything brainiac 13 did in the past was designed to ensure things reached the point where brainiac 13 would be created brainiac 12 s defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances brainiac 13 had made to metropolis 32 the insiders edit main

while his ship was destroyed brainiac s condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown 33 34 silver age brainiac in the post crisis universe edit later stories revealed that elements of brainiac s pre crisis history occurred in the post crisis character s history prior to his possession of milton moses fine and his first encounter with superman the citizens of kandor recall that brainiac stole their city from krypton and not the alien wizard tolos 32 history of the dc universe mentions his defeat by the omega men although this is not seen in crisis on infinite earths itself and noted a second brainiac was created in a laboratory on earth two years later in the silver age jla one shot the injustice league discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in brainiac s

brainiac wakes up his computer announces attempt 242 in progress a reference to brainiac s first appearance in action comics 242 and to the many encounters between brainiac and superman in the following issue supergirl reveals to superman that brainiac shrunk the kryptonian city of kandor and placed it in a bottle and that all previous incarnations of brainiac that superman has encountered were just probes clones and nanite controlled bodies she notes that no one has ever actually seen brainiac inspired by supergirl s story superman attempts to find brainiac and stop him he heads to a world under attack by brainiac just in time to be caught in a supernova as brainiac destroys the system s star and the populated world along with it the supernova knocks superman out and he is caught and brought onto brainiac s ship superman escapes from his imprisonment and sees brainiac emerging from his bio shell this version of brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original pre crisis brainiac and has motives similar to the superman the animated series incarnation of the character in that he travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization s knowledge is increased superman attacks brainiac but brainiac manages to overpower the man of steel before restraining him with the help of his ship s internal systems brainiac inserts the subdued superman into a machine that allows him to read the kryptonian s mind with the intent of assimilating his brain brainiac s ship then travels to earth and prepares to abduct the city of metropolis brainiac successfully steals metropolis and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the sun and the earth itself supergirl ends up captured along with the rest of metropolis but superman breaks out of his restraints again and frees her supergirl stops the missile while superman battles brainiac brainiac appears to have the advantage in physical combat yet again but superman knocks brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp where brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body superman uses this distraction to defeat brainiac while superman frees the cities of metropolis and kandor the villain launches a missile to the kent farm in an act of spite the farm is destroyed and jonathan kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it 36 brainiac is brought to a top secret military base where the imprisoned lex luthor is assigned to discover his secrets luthor eventually manages to use brainiac s connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him brainiac manages to free himself from luthor s control forcing him on board the ship and the two make their escape 37 notably upon learning of brainiac s modus operandi of destroying planets by destabilizing nearby stars when he is done collecting cities and knowledge from said planets superman openly speculates that brainiac destroyed krypton which was destroyed when its sun went nova soon after brainiac abducted kandor and argo he also asks the alien what he did to krypton s sun 38 brainiac ignores the query neither confirming or denying his responsibility though he does heavily imply it in fifty seven minutes my solar aggressor will reach your sun it will flare up and the earth will be incinerated just like krypton superman still believes brainiac had a part in krypton s destruction after the end of this story arc 39 new krypton edit main articles superman last stand of new krypton and superman war of the supermen following this brainiac now in possession of his ship again unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of new krypton and the kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones general zod s army proves totally unable to fend them off as the brainiac s ship s force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red sunray guns allowing them to kill tens of thousands of kryptonians superman being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields having learned the trick in the previous story arc manages to enter brainiac s ship supergirl leads the kryptonians against the drones but is attacked by an anti kryptonian brainiac probe superboy mon el and the legion of super heroes join the fight and save supergirl after this brainiac shrinks kandor again and re bottles it including a miniature red sun to de power all the kryptonians inside the legion supergirl superboy zod and superman all make it on to brainiac s ship thanks to brainiac 5 hacking his ancestor s force fields and allowing them entry the legion explains to zod that just as krypton s city of kandor is held in a bottle onboard brainiac s ship other planets cities are also imprisoned and therefore zod cannot destroy brainiac s ship until the cities can be rescued zod sends supergirl off and then arrests the legionnaires branding them terrorists meanwhile superman is about to face off against brainiac when he is knocked down by a kryptonite energy blast fired by lex luthor and subsequently captured brainiac locks him in captivity with the intent to experiment on him but superman escapes and meets up with the rest of the superheroes and zod on a separate section of the ship zod enters the scene and engages brainiac in combat while supergirl superboy and the legion recover the bottled cities on brainiac s ship including kandor zod seems to be losing his fight with brainiac when suddenly superman gets up and tackles brainiac from behind before the battle between the two kryptonians and the villain can continue brainiac s ship starts to destabilize and descend towards the planet it is revealed that lex luthor sabotaged the ship and re sized one of the cities while inside luthor s intervention causes the ship to crash into new krypton destroying it while supergirl and the legion re size kandor however the city that luthor expanded is still growing now putting kandor at risk as brainiac 5 works on the problem supergirl is shocked to discover superman impaled by pieces of brainiac s ship as a result of the explosion superman appears to have been fatally stricken luthor though reeling from the explosion is pleased with all the destruction he has caused brainiac confronts luthor in the ruins of the ship and is furious that lex sabotaged his ship luthor mocks him and spits in his eye before brainiac angrily snaps luthor s neck killing him now deprived of his ship and technology and seemingly depowered by his ship s destruction brainiac finds himself faced by an entire city of angry solar powered kryptonians zod is eager for a final showdown with brainiac who calls zod a coward for confronting brainiac with his powers intact and an army of super powered kryptonians at his back in response zod fires the red sun radiation from an archer rifle at himself to remove his powers and thus supposedly level the playing field as he prepares to take brainiac down brainiac 5 gives superman a transfusion of conner s blood and exposes him to a very large dose of concentrated synthesized yellow sun rays using these techniques brainiac 5 is able to revive superman despite the loss of his powers zod is able to get the upper hand on the similarly powerless brainiac and force him to his knees zod is about to shoot brainiac when superman intervenes this causes a heated argument between superman and zod zod commands his soldiers to restrain kal el so zod can proceed with the execution of brainiac brainiac 5 sensing that this is his moment of destiny steps in and teleports himself and brainiac off of new krypton it is revealed that lex used a luthor robot supplied by the toyman to accomplish his mission on new krypton and that brainiac killed the robot instead lex is very much alive and discussing with general lane how his objective to bring chaos to new krypton was achieved lex has been working as an agent of general lane all along the disarray that lex caused provides lane with a window of opportunity as he prepares for the impending war with new krypton lex receives a presidential pardon for his efforts the story ends with zod rallying his people as he declares war on the planet earth the story concludes in the next miniseries superman war of the supermen mon el plants the many bottled cities that brainiac has captured over the years on various planets across the galaxy these cities will one day become the united planets by the 31st century the same planets that will produce the members of the legion of super heroes brainiac 5 takes brainiac to their homeworld of colu where he hands him over to vril dox ii a k a brainiac 2 vril dox happily turns his father over to his people for his crimes however lyrl dox a k a brainiac 3 releases his grandfather with a weapon called pulsar stargrave what then occurs is an all out battle for colu between all three present day brainiacs vril dox even calls in lobo for help brainac breaks out of his prison and after causing much damage on colu escapes with pulsar stargrave in tow for parts unknown 40 the new 52 edit brainiac s origin in the new 52 is revealed in superman 23 2 vril dox was acknowledged as the greatest scientist on his homeworld yod colu given his advances in force field technology and miniaturization he developed an artificial intelligence c o m p u t o allowing him to discover the fifth dimension dox discovered the fifth dimension was in a state of war and a group of its inhabitants the multitude had entered their dimension and destroyed over a hundred planets realizing yod colu was next in the multitude s path dox tried to find a way to save his planet even performing experiments on his son the magistrates of yod colu sentenced dox to exile but dox used c o m p u t o to take control of yod colu s computer networks copying the planet s database dox constructed an army of robot servants called terminauts and miniaturized the city his wife and son lived on and bottled it in a force field while the rest of yod colu was destroyed by the multitude after the destruction of yod colu dox constructed an army of starships and distributed his consciousness across a series of robots that would each travel the universe in order to preserve planets from the multitude becoming known as the collector of worlds one of these robots attacked krypton dox became fascinated by jor el a kryptonian scientist who actually saved his homeworld from the multitude upon returning to krypton however brainiac discovered krypton had been destroyed 41 referred to at first as the collector of worlds brainiac is first seen as the mysterious informant that supplies lex luthor information of superman and his alien nature 42 clark is having a dream of krypton s final moments in which an artificial intelligence that controls the planet wakes up robots in an attempt to preserve the kryptonian culture later while clark conducts an interview in a robotic factory the same harvester robots appear john corben the soon to be supervillain metallo is suddenly possessed by the artificial intelligence it demands superman 43 the robots create havoc throughout metropolis but superman soon realizes that they are really after him superman fights the possessed corben with the help of john henry irons although they managed to defeat him the alien sentience had already miniaturized and bottled the city of metropolis and took it to his ship in space 44 superman travels to the ship to find many alien bottled cities kandor included the alien identifies himself as a being from the planet colu where he was known as c o m p u t o and on krypton he was called brainiac 1 0 he claims that without superman and the ship that brought him to earth his kryptonian collection is incomplete the alien intelligence demands superman make a choice the intelligence will disable life support in both the kandor and metropolis bottles and superman must choose which city to save using indestructible kryptonian armor found on the ship superman decides on neither and wears the armor which changes instantly into the current superman costume design brainiac sends metallo to attack superman but due to superman reasoning with him over his feelings for lois lane he breaks free of brainiac s control and joins superman in his attack superman then uses his rocket from krypton that had also been miniaturized with metropolis to attack brainiac s mind which the rocket was able to do since its primary mission was to protect kal el in doing so metropolis was returned to earth and superman took possession of brainiac s ship and made it his new super citadel 45 notably the ship clark was placed into as a child was described as having brainiac ai leaving the identity of the collector of worlds in doubt 46 the colony of the collector of worlds told superman that its ai technology went by different names beginning on yod colu as c o m p u t o on noma he was called pneumenoid on bryak it was mind2 on krypton he was called brainiac 1

before leaving for parts unknown 48 convergence edit main articles superman doomed and convergence comics back on earth during an investigation of 20 kidnapped people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by brainiac one of these 20 infects lois lane thereby giving brainiac control over a close ally of superman 49 brainiac plots his return to earth using lane to infiltrate earth s defense systems to allow an easier path for his physical return 50 and even upgrading her body to contain his 12th level intelligence his minion cyborg superman a reconstructed zor el father of supergirl 51 constructs a portal to allow brainiac s command ship and daughter ships to travel to earth from throughout the galaxy 52 superman whom brainiac had conspired to infect with the monster doomsday in order to drive him away from earth uses his augmented power to attack brainiac s gigantic mothership and break through to its core and finally vril dox himself the coluan appears still humanoid and explains his reasoning for stealing minds from throughout the universe he has concluded that if he can unite the minds of a certain critical number of people he will be able to change reality itself his motivation for this appears a desire to right the wrongs he feels responsible for the loss of his wife and child back on colu his plan is undone when superman drags him mothership and all into a black hole but then vril dox is snatched away to safety it seems by a being who appears to be the true brainiac an immensely powerful entity from outside the universe itself 53 this version of brainiac a composite of brainiac from around the multiverse is revealed to be the pre flashpoint era brainiac who having found his way into the source wall and into the multiverse was thrown back in the timestream and mutated by the effects of crisis events such as crisis on infinite earths zero hour and 52 creating a godlike being 54 he then uncovered the location of vanishing point from nearly killing new 52 earth 0 s michelle carter from which he could roam the complete history of the multiverse collecting doomed cities from defunct timelines alternative futures and parallel worlds to add to his collection in convergence leaving behind an agent telos to rule a planet of the same name containing the cities brainiac s attempt to do this to a future timeline of earth 0 was narrowly averted by the heroes in the story the new 52 futures end brainiac was contained in a t sphere leaving telos stranded without his master prompting the events of convergence in which the planets are bid to fight each other when the events of convergence nearly end in an irreversible destruction of the multiverse the time traveller waverider formerly the pre flashpoint booster gold frees brainiac who reveals he is sick from his mutations and only wishes to return to normal to being brainiac of colu he sends most of the heroes home and with help from the zero hour parallax and the pre flashpoint superman averts the collapse of the multiverse from crisis on infinite earths and is returned to the normal brainiac his actions also allow various parallel universes and alternate timelines to exist as the new multiverse 55 green lantern corps edit brainiac s name is first referenced in an issue of hal jordan and the green lantern corps the entirety of the green and yellow lanterns including hal jordan guy gardner and john stewart along with starro the conqueror are lured into a trap and subsequently hit with a shrink ray while on the planet xudar leaving them tiny and helpless in the next issue they are trapped in a bottle and their jailer is revealed to be a robot claiming to run on brainiac 2 0 software the robot heavily resembles both brainiac s 1983 skeleton esque incarnation and the robotic drones utilized by the post 2008 version of brainiac it has a collection of shrunken bottled planets and travels in a ship resembling brainiac s skullship at the time it was not clear if this was the true brainiac after rebirth or yet another one of his drones 56 the machine s victory is short lived however as it is revealed that larfleeze was able to reprogram it to his side using an orange lantern ring having rebooted its life systems after finding it inactive on his homeworld with its ship larfleeze is impressed that the machine was able to capture the green lanterns and starro and even more impressed with the machine s shrinking technology and plans to hijack its technology to put together his own collection he takes the ship and collection to his homeworld of okaara however upon being informed that the yellow and green lanterns are still fighting inside the bottle and trying to kill each other larfleeze s own greed for having everything gets the best of him and he ends up breaking the container this frees the lanterns and somehow restores them to their normal size and strength after which they immediately start rampaging inside the ship and trashing brainiac larfleeze s collection hal kyle john and guy go on to lead the attack on the orange lantern corps with everyone fighting together the orange lantern corps are quickly overwhelmed larfleeze accuses the robot of playing him when it responds that it simply did what he programmed it to do larfleeze destroys it in a rage 57 the superman storyline new world later confirmed via a flashback cameo that the post crisis post 2008 version of brainiac the tall muscular green skinned cybernetic alien scientist still exists in the post rebirth continuity and has encountered superman in the past thus the robot that defeated starro the green lantern corps and the yellow lantern corps before subsequently being dispatched by larfleeze was in fact one of his drones 58 no justice edit brainiac later arrived on earth again and battled the justice league who proved no match for him and his ship until superman arrived however he did not come to destroy the earth but to deliver a warning that there is a cosmic level threat in the universe coming to earth one that the heroes of earth are woefully ill prepared for brainiac thinks he can defeat the threat but it means teaming up with superman and the justice league and combining members of the league with some of the most dangerous supervillains in the dc universe and sending them into battle against this extinction level menace four teams outfitted with brainiac s technology are formed including among other members lex luthor batman wonder woman and sinestro with brainiac himself working directly alongside his nemesis superman 59 the no justice miniseries begins with the omega titans the aforementioned threat attacking colu brainiac s homeworld which explains brainiac s kidnapping of earth s superheroes and supervillains brainiac claims to have developed a plan to defeat the omega titans and the superheroes only need to follow his orders to win but amanda waller uses the hidden protocol xi which involves kidnapping the world s most dangerous psychics to probe brainiac s mind and find out what he knows the strain of the psychic attack causes brainiac s head to explode apparently killing him 60 in scott snyder s justice league run in order to fill in the gap left by black manta and the joker lex luthor sets professor ivo to work reconstructing brainiac with the intention of him joining the legion of doom despite teaming up with them brainiac does have his own motivations including planning his revenge against waller brainiac 6 edit he is the gang version of brainiac and first appears in adventures of the super sons 1 61 powers and abilities edit brainiac s most consistent power endemic to all versions is his twelfth level intellect allowing calculation abilities enhanced memory and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering bio engineering physics and as well as other theoretical and applied sciences 62 for comparison the population of 20th century earth constitutes a sixth level intelligence while the population of 31st century earth are a ninth level intelligence his post crisis incarnation claims that his brain can process and sort knowledge of over four hundred ninety octodecillion beings 4 9 1059 38 which is an enormous number about five billion times the estimated number of atoms on earth all the different versions have created devices such as a force field belt capable of withstanding superman s most powerful blows 63 and a shrink ray capable of reducing cities 63 brainiac s advanced mental powers have shown him capable of possessing others absorbing information from other beings transferring his consciousness 64 creating and manipulating computer systems replicating duplicate bodies for himself and exerting powers to traverse or control space time among organic beings brainiac views only his frequent partner lex luthor as a peer intellect brainiac is usually depicted with incredibly high levels of strength durability and speed the exact level varies but usually hovers at around superman s strength brainiac s exact abilities vary drastically throughout his various incarnations pre crisis edit originally brainiac was a scientist with no superhuman abilities aside from his intellect he fought superman via the use of his advanced technology and cunning similar to lex luthor among these were a force field belt that protects him from all harm a shrink ray to capture and bottle cities even metropolis and a headpiece consisting of a cluster of diode electrode like objects his cybernetic headpiece lets him interface with technology and discharge energy blasts from his head which were powerful enough to significantly harm superman the man of steel described these blasts as blindingly painful almost unbearable and a threat to his life 65 when the crisis on infinite earths struck brainiac can detect the lies of others by reading their thoughts 66 the pre crisis brainiac was referred to by an omniscient narrator as the super computer space pirate superman s most powerful nemesis 67 brainiac being unpowered and reliant on external weaponry was largely still the case even he is retconned as an android but in the 1980s everything changed and he gained the abilities that would stick to all his subsequent incarnations super physical attributes intelligence and technopathy his technopatic abilities extend to control of his ship in which he shares a symbiotic relationship however he is capable of downloading his consciousness to spare robotic bodies in this event that the original one was destroyed or damaged brainiac could also possess organic beings in certain circumstances as he did to luthor during whatever happened to the man of tomorrow the final body utilized by the pre crisis brainiac resembling a robotic skeleton was technopathic strong and resilient and knew how to generate the psychokinetic energies and spin them into a web like net which could hold superman at bay among the knowledge he absorbed was extensive information on hand to hand techniques making him a very skilled combatant despite this he saw physical confrontation as beneath him and preferred to defeat foes with his mind 68 post crisis edit probes edit john byrne s re imagining of the character has telepathy and telekinesis as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies he was an artificial intelligence who had inhabited the body of a human psychic and awakened his powers further enhancing them with an implanted electrode headpiece his vast psychic powers allowed him to seriously challenge superman and defeat many members of the new gods including orion with a single blast 69 but this body s lack of durability is the major liability and eventually led to it being rendered useless in a gasoline explosion after the organic body was destroyed his consciousness built and possessed multiple robotic bodies and occasionally hijacks other organic bodies such as doomsday s his abilities were dependent on the body he was inhabiting at the time in which could vary from weak as normal to far stronger than abnormal his nanoswarm incarnation known as brainiac 2 5 for instance can shapeshift regenerate bend technology to his whim project energy blasts and force fields and match superman blow for blow superman stated brainiac to have physical strength on par with doomsday in this form 70 his strongest incarnation was brainiac 13 who even prior to absorbing imperiex was so physically formidable that superman cannot remotely affect much less damage him by contrast brainiac could easily kill superman in a short time if he have not been devoted to torture the man of steel 71 true form edit it was later revealed that this version of brainiac like the previous ones is merely a mentally controlled probe the real brainiac who was a living coluan had himself genetically and cybernetically modified the true brainiac lacked psychic powers but still have abilities identical to his original incarnations he possesses a level of strength and durability far greater than superman capable of easily overpowering the kryptonian in unarmed combat 72 and withstanding several consecutive blows to the face from superman without visible harm 73 his speed is vastly surpassing so fast that he once caught a punch thrown by the man of steel 74 at one point brainiac 5 warns superman that he would most likely die against brainiac in a straight fight 75 despite his massive biomechanical modifications brainiac has a few weaknesses like the pre crisis brainiac he is telepathically linked to his ship in such way that if separation of it without warning can disable him for a short period but prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become less powerful just as lex luthor observed this while studying his unconscious body over course of several days when it was in custody of the u s government initially he is only overloaded in particularly dirty environments and human society via mysophobia while landing into earth s atmosphere 76 though brainiac does not seem to have this defect on earth in his later battles such as defeating superboy 77 suggesting that he fixed it this brainiac is an incredibly experienced fighter but like his pre crisis counterpart is most dangerous due to the advanced technology he wields much of it of his own invention these include his classic shrink ray and force field belt and other gadgets such as missiles capable of causing stars to go into a premature supernova state 78 his force fields are so impregnable that a direct hit from an energy weapon killed several solar powered kryptonians as collateral damage and didn t leave so much a single scratch on his ship 79 brainiac also possesses an army of at least ten or thousand humanoid robotic probes these probes are strong enough to draw blood from superman 80 and tough enough to survive some of his powerful blows during the new krypton story arc brainiac upgraded his probes with red sun ray guns for the purpose of fighting fully powered kryptonians when brainiac orders these drones to attack new krypton they quickly kill over eleven thousand kryptonians 81 he is a bionically engineered cyborg who wants to acquire more knowledge and become better 82 with his ship twelfth level intellect and powerful technology brainiac has captured a thousand cities absorbed all information and destroyed many worlds 83 making him into the most feared being in that known universe the new 52 edit brainiac in the new 52 seems to have kept most of the powers and equipment of his post crisis incarnation including his shrink ray force field belt and robot army with notable additions brainiac s ship has been massively upgraded in this incarnation it is now larger than the entire planetary system 84 and carries within a huge invasion fleet of smaller ships in numerous types he still appears to possess the physical strength near invulnerability and fast speed of his post crisis counterpart as shown when he easily defeats zor el 85 by the superman doomed story arc brainiac utilizes his vast intellect to become an enormously powerful psychic augmented by all the minds he had stolen and digitized from across every galaxy then he is capable of taking control of eight billion minds on earth at the same time he also demonstrates considerable mental abilities claiming that their combined brainwaves throughout the universe can allow him to alter reality at will he plans on using this newfound power to remake it into own his image however brainiac s plan prematurely ended when superman battles him telepathically and crashes his ship into a black hole following the doomed story arc it is further revealed that this pre crisis brainiac somehow escaped and mutated from the crisis on infinite earths itself ever since becoming a god like being this version of brainiac is nigh omnipotent with the ability to warp universes and time travel using this new 52 incarnation as one of his probes he either created or interacted with different iterations of himself throughout the whole multiverse brainiac has grown so much in power that he can collect cities from other universes at will at the end of the convergence story arc he recreates the dc multiverse 86 other versions edit the character has been depicted in various out of continuity stories in the amalgam comics line which was a joint venture between dc and marvel comics readers are introduced to galactiac a combination of brainiac and marvel comics antagonist galactus 87 brainiac also appears in superman red son 88 jla shogun of steel 89 and the novel the last days of krypton by author kevin j anderson 90 superman red son edit in the superman red son graphic novel brainiac here depicted as an alien ai serves as the main antagonist he first appears working with luthor in 1978 to undermine superman eventually shrinking and bottling the city of stalingrad superman defeats brainiac soon after but his inability to restore stalingrad becomes his one failure and a recurring source of guilt after his defeat superman has brainiac reprogrammed in order to serve him and the earth and help run superman s global soviet union a task he takes to for the next four decades while serving superman brainiac repeatedly advises him to take more drastic courses of action to resolve his problems such as suggesting he merely invade luthor s united states though superman always rebuffs his most extreme suggestions at the climax of the story after luthor infiltrates his capitol superman does decide to invade the united states defeating a futuristic u s pacific fleet and an army of superbeings including wonder woman green lantern and doomsday along the way luthor himself is yanked down deep into the recesses of the fortress by brainiac to be converted surgically into a superman robot brainiac and superman storm the white house after defeating all the u s s defenders they are greeted by lois luthor with the last weapon a small note written by president lex luthor that reads why don t you just put the whole world in a bottle superman superman realizing the error of his ways is horrified by the revelation that he has essentially become another brainiac an alien bullying a less developed species he calls off the invasion but brainiac objects he reveals that his twelfth level intellect let him easily subvert any attempts at reprogramming him and that he has never been under superman s control he attacks superman with a kryptonite beam weapon nearly killing him while boasting about how he will conquer the entire universe after finishing off all his foes on earth however he is finally defeated when luthor having escaped surgery through undisclosed means hacks and shuts off brainiac from the inside his body is promptly destroyed by superman in one last act of spite brainiac s death automatically triggers his ship s self destruct which according to luthor would eradicate the entire earth and everything within a 15 000 000 mile radius as the gravitational singularities powering brainiac s ship threaten to explode superman rockets it into outer space where it blows up the earth is saved but superman is thought to have been caught in an explosion and killed in the epilogue at lex luthor s funeral a thousand years in the future it is revealed that unbeknownst to the rest of the earth superman survived the destruction of brainiac s ship he walks quietly away from the ceremony planning to live among humans rather than ruling over them jla earth 2 edit in the jla earth 2 one shot the justice league are drawn to the anti matter universe to defeat the crime syndicate of america their villainous anti matter counterparts with brainiac apparently acting as the robotic servant of ultraman however after the syndicate travel to the league s universe it is revealed that the true mastermind of the scheme was brainiac who is revealed to be an organic life form trapped in a tank acting as ultraman s servant since ultraman captured brainiac s hq the flying fortress having manipulated both teams into a position where they will be trapped in each other s worlds and thus unable to win as the god of each world means that good and evil will always win in each world however brainiac is defeated when the league deliberately deserts so that the syndicate can return in time to stop him batman the dark knight strikes again edit in batman the dark knight strikes again set in a world where heroes have been publicly retired for years as lex luthor took over and blackmailed assorted heroes into acting as his discreet servants brainiac is working with luthor to keep the city of kandor contained the two destroying one kryptonian family each time superman defies them he is eventually loved by lara the daughter of superman and wonder woman who claims to be surrendering to him only to allow the atom to break the bottle from inside and allow the kryptonians within to access their powers decimating brainiac with their heat vision 91 bizarro brainiac edit bizarro 1 created this doppelganger of brainiac to live on bizarro world since brainiac shrunk the city of kandor his bizarro counterpart felt compelled to do the opposite and expanded a city in antarctica creating big city 92 flashpoint edit in the alternate timeline of the flashpoint event brainiac is the ruler of 31st century earth and has captured kid flash whom he then placed in stasis but hot pursuit managed to rescue the young speedster 93 escaping from brainiac s base kid flash and hot pursuit formulate a plan to return to the 21st century kid flash then allows himself to be recaptured by brainiac and put into stasis kid flash uses his super speed in the virtual reality access port to shut down the security program and hot pursuit then blasts brainiac from behind while they used his orb energy to return to the past brainiac impaled hot pursuit and attacked kid flash hot pursuit breaks the orb energy projector to allow kid flash s super speed to return kid flash then returns to the 21st century promising to rescue hot pursuit from brainiac 94 justice league power rangers edit brainiac is one of the villains in the justice league power rangers crossover when the power rangers and lord zedd accidentally travel to the dc universe through a teleportation accident with the rangers arriving in gotham city 95 while zedd finds himself in one of the trapped cities on brainiac s ship escaping from the bottle zedd proposes an alliance with brainiac in exchange for providing brainiac with a city from his earth zedd releasing a wave of monsters across the world to distract the justice league 96 using the distraction of zedd s monsters brainiac dispatches his drones to take control of the rangers zords stealing their powers and fleeing back to their world forcing the rangers and the justice league to borrow the large hadron collider to create a temporary dimensional transporter that will allow them all to get back to the rangers world 97 back in the rangers world brainiac nearly takes control of cyborg but billy cranston is able to regain his powers in time to take cyborg down 98 so that batman can reboot him brainiac has captured alpha 5 officially to question him as the only other example of independent artificial sentience he has ever met but alpha although speculating that brainiac abducted him because the villain is lonely rejects the idea that the two are similar arguing that brainiac s actions show a selfishness and an inability to grow where true sentience relies on making oneself open to working with others after regaining their powers the rangers are able to rescue alpha and force brainiac into retreat 99 adventures of supergirl edit in the adventures of supergirl comic which takes place in the universe of the supergirl tv series a very different version of vril dox appears as a recurring villain in this series he is a greedy green skinned alien hacker from the planet yod who was hired by an as yet unknown individual to frame supergirl s ally winn schott for funding and aiding terrorism when supergirl accesses winn s computer he presents himself falsely as an a i system called v r i l and pretends to be a creation of schott s he figures out supergirl s

smallville with additional portrayals done by john schneider jonathan kent in season five john glover lionel luthor in season seven laura vandervoort kara zor el in season seven and allison mack chloe sullivan in season eight acting as a central antagonist for seasons 5 and 7 and a supporting villain for season 8 brainiac is mostly referred to by his assumed name of milton fine but jor el refers to him as the brain interactive construct this interpretation is similar to the dc animated universe version a humanoid self aware nano supercomputer of kryptonian origin who had a part in the planet s destruction having destabilized krypton s core alongside zod in addition to portrayed as a shapeshifting ai resembling the t 1000 from terminator 2 judgment day capable of mimicking kryptonian abilities and able to duplicate it was created by dax ur who abandoned the project and completed by jor el but corrupted by zod introduced in season 5 though alluded in season four s finale where he was part of the black ship carrying the disciples of zod he first appears under the milton fine name posing as a history professor at fictional central kansas a m university and presenting himself as a kryptonian ally to trick clark kent into releasing zod from the phantom zone even going far to proclaiming jor el was a murderer and the one who infected mrs kent with a virus while zod was the hero of all krypton but after clark learns the truth in his fortress brainiac is defeated and precedes to manipulates lex luthor under the guise of being a government agent into creating a vaccine it is revealed that will make luthor s body suitable to act as zod s new host after temporarily shutting down all of earth s electronics with a virus although apparently destroyed a survived copy of brainiac is seen in season 7 hiding in metropolis suicide slums when offered help from the phantom clark the weakened android manipulated the phantom clark into helping regain his full power by locating dax ur his creator whom he killed after downloading the latter s memories brainiac would continue to convince luthor that clark is a threat by impersonating kara zor el and revealing clark s secret identity to luthor but is defeated in battle by clark and seemingly killed by overloading his body with electricity however a fragment of brainiac returns in season 8 by possessing chloe

apocalypse living in a universe where kal el never arrived on earth brainiac is the white house chief of staff under president lex luthor and alongside kara zor el under the name agent danvers when

brainiac brainiac attempts to reboot but is stopped by the league brainiac s voice is pitched down for this show as the producers of static shock wanted a more monstrous performance from corey burton as opposed to his usual cold and remorseless depiction of the character 104 brainiac once more returns in justice league unlimited the second season s penultimate episode reveals a major plot twist that dates back to the superman the animated series episode ghost in the machine in which brainiac secretly implanted a copy of himself into lex luthor s body as a failsafe since then he has remained

intention of reconstituting him but inadvertently resurrects darkseid instead thanks to tala s interference with the process film edit live action edit during the early development of superman iii ilya salkind wrote a script in that brainiac was featured as the main antagonist 105 however when leslie newman and david newman rewrote the script brainiac was cut from the film late actor richard pryor was considered for the role 106 brainiac was planned as one of the three main villains in the scrapped superman reborn and superman lives film projects most notably he was featured along with lex luthor and doomsday in kevin smith s version of the script which was later discarded by director tim burton burton s own script included brainiac s intellect bonding with lex luthor known as lexiac as would later happen in justice league unlimited and which had previously been seen in the comic book story superman whatever happened to the man of tomorrow 107 in 2007 film director bryan singer reported that he wanted to use brainiac along with bizarro as the antagonists in the cancelled superman the man of steel the planned sequel to superman returns 108 however the project was finally scrapped by warner bros brainiac has been suggested as definitely down the road as a villain in the dc extended universe and future man of steel sequels by director zack snyder there are nods to brainiac in man of steel such as the skull shape of the codex the tentacles attached to the world engine and general zod experiencing sensory overloads when exposed to earth s atmosphere similar to brainiac s weakness 109 animation edit brainiac appears as the titular antagonist in the 2006 direct to video animated feature superman brainiac attacks voiced by lance henriksen the movie begins with brainiac landing on earth in a meteor brainiac goes around absorbing information until superman destroys him with his arctic breath however lex luthor is able to save a piece of brainiac and forms an alliance with the kryptonian robot luthor gives brainiac a new body made from his satellite weapon brainiac is also equipped with a kryptonite beam and the ability to track superman by his kryptonian dna luthor and brainiac s bargain revolves around brainiac using his new body to destroy superman and afterwards brainiac would allow himself to be defeated by luthor and leave for another planet so that luthor would appear as a hero however brainiac betrayed luthor after he believed superman was destroyed but in the end superman returned to defeat brainiac after a lengthy battle this time
