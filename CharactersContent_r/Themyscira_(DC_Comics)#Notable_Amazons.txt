emissary from paradise island who will accompany steve back to man s world and aid in the fight against the axis powers it was established that all amazons are adept at a discipline called bullets and bracelets in which they can deflect bullets fired at them using the chain bands on their wrists it was originally implied but not yet fully confirmed that paradise island was located somewhere in the pacific ocean then in the 1970s television incarnation as portrayed by lynda carter paradise island s location was set in the bermuda triangle and the 2009 animated movie version had set it in the aegean sea originally there were three generations of amazons living on the island with princess diana being from the second this basic back story remains intact throughout the golden age and silver age of comic books until the 1985 1986 crisis on infinite earths storyline upon the conclusion of this limited series most characters in the dc comics universe underwent some revamp or retcon in their storyline history and wonder woman was one of several characters whose entire continuity was rebooted post crisis 1987 present edit the 1987 relaunch of the wonder woman series establishes that the

the amazons their slaves hippolyta pleads with the goddesses for help athena agrees to aid the amazons but only if they do not go against their purpose of creation by seeking revenge when they agree to her terms athena frees the amazons from their chains once freed however the amazons proceed to slaughter most of their captors antiope leads a force of amazons off into greece seeking vengeance on heracles as decreed by the goddesses hippolyta leads the remaining amazons to a remote island where as penance for their failures as teachers they become guardians of doom s doorway preventing the escape of the monsters beneath renaming the island paradise themyscira after their fallen capital the amazons began their new lives erecting buildings and monuments and perfecting their skills as artisans and warriors for centuries the amazons of themyscira live in a perfect state of harmony with their surroundings under a theocracy they know no racism although many consider antiope s lost tribe of amazons as little more than savages they do not think in terms of male gender the word policeman is alien to them until diana s departure into the outside world homosexuality is completely natural to them while some amazons are chaste others have loving consorts their city is composed entirely of greco roman architecture from 1200 bce and they wear greek garb togas sandals and period armor the amazons also all wear the bracelets of submission as constant reminders of their enslavement and obedience to their patrons although only diana can deflect bullets with them they are fervently religious worshipping their gods as living deities artemis is their primary goddess and they worship her with a sacrifice of a deer the amazons celebrate their creation each year in a feast of five remembering the goddesses who brought them to life occasionally the nereides bring to the shores of themyscira young infants who would have otherwise drowned in accidents to which the amazons of paradise island would initiate a process called send forth where these infants are tutored spiritually in amazonian ideals and they are then sent back mystically to the place of their disappearance

themyscira to dignitaries of patriarch s world the creatures beneath doom s doorway were defeated and for a time the amazons destroyed their battle armor as a testament to a new period of peace the amazons opened up their shores to dignitaries from patriarch s world female and male but that exchange was almost destroyed by eris goddess of discord the amazons even conducted their own tour of the united states where they were framed for the murders of several people by antiope s descendants the mercenary assassins of bana mighdall and circe it was during the war of the gods that the amazons recrafted their armory vowing to again become warriors circe would transplant many of these mercenary women of bana migdhall called the lost tribe to themyscira where after warring with the amazons already there the two factions joined forces to stop circe herself the two sects of amazons forged an uneasy truce living at opposite ends of the island professor julia kapatelis a close friend to wonder woman and the amazons was later presented with a grant by the national geographic society to locate the original turkish city of themyscira 9 unfortunately julia had to leave the excavation midway through the project once one of her daughter s friends committed suicide 10 whether the original city of themyscira has been fully excavated or not has not been shown later still darkseid s forces ravaged themyscira during a search to locate the greek gods killing nearly half of the amazons there in the process as they began rebuilding the amazons found themselves reverting to stone this was as a result of the gods departure from the mortal plane and the amazons connection to their creator beings so diminished as to revert their bodies to their primordial state with the gods returned to olympus the amazons were again transformed into their flesh and blood state yet more amazons were killed in a confrontation with the demonic entity known as neron with diana and hippolyta adventuring in patriarch s world as wonder woman for longer and longer periods of time the banas and the themyscirans were manipulated into a bloody civil war at the hands of magala who had been possessed by the spirit of antiope s murderer ariadne using the pre existing disdain of the tribes against each other magala used allies among both amazon cities to spark the vengeful conflict the island was left in ruins and the war was only stopped when hippolyta abolished the royal family renounced her throne left at odds but on even political ground the bana amazons and the themyscirans joined forces against the alien forces of imperiex themyscira mystically moved into outer space was destroyed and hundreds of amazons from both tribes died 7 when wonder woman led each tribe of

themyscira was built with the help of alien technology adding to the re creation of the islands themyscira was restored by the combined might of the greek and egyptian goddesses the amazons worship transformed into a mighty series of floating islands dedicated to the free exchange of information and ideas the new themyscira was governed by members of both tribes of amazons after some time themyscira was nearly destroyed in a jealous fit of rage by the goddess hera she was angry that zeus was magically spying on the bathing form of artemis via scrying the pool and kicked the pool itself 7 because of her actions the islands ceased to float in mid air under their own power and instead resumed being a cluster of traditional islands once more recently themyscira was under attack by omac forces as described in dc comics s infinite crisis due to this attack as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since diana became wonder woman it was decided that the olympian and bana mighdallian goddesses would transport the island and its inhabitants sans diana to an undisclosed location to live in peace one year later edit under the direction of the writer will pfeifer the amazons attack washington d c as retaliation for the attack on the island in a six part mini series titled amazons attack at the end of the series the amazons have their memories erased by granny goodness posing as the goddess athena and are scattered throughout the world with false personas only hippolyta and four of her original royal guard remain on themyscira the queen is exiled to

introduced paradise island possessed horses and creatures called kangas reminiscent of the island country australia s kangaroos that the amazons both rode like mounts the kangas were probably a breed of kangaroos which were introduced into the island from australia via coastal migration which the amazons bred them and where they originated from diana s kanga was named jumpa there were also smaller rabbit like creatures wandering paradise island post crisis edit when the wonder woman comic book was revamped and started anew in the mid 1980s this was scrapped and the island only had common game animals such as antelopes deer wild boar bears lions and fish pets such as birds cats foxes dogs and monkeys and livestock animals such as horses donkeys camels cattle water buffalo sheep such as the european mouflon goats such as the kri kri and pigs domesticated descendants of wild boar diana also had a pet pig named pb actually a character from the cgi animated film dc league of super pets the only exotic mythological creatures on the island were more sinister in nature and existed in doom s doorway to the underworld which the amazons swore to keep trapped and never to escape in the waters surrounding themyscira also lived naiads and in the forests dryads who played most of their days away occasionally with the amazons in 1999 when writer eric luke took over the wonder woman comic book he had several lost mythical creatures from around the globe take asylum on themyscira these creatures consisted of chiron the centaur a white pegasus ladon the dragon a chimera and a sphinx 12 then when writer phil jimenez wrote the title in the early 2000s he had several dinosaurs from the land of skartaris also take refuge on themyscira in addition to the reappearance of kangas on the island to date no kangas has been seen as riding animals writer greg rucka reintroduced a second pegasus to serve as wonder woman s riding companion this one black with red eyes it is assumed he still lives on themyscira in 2003 a flashback story by matt wagner called batman superman wonder woman trinity has the island defended by sapient giant birds they perish in the defense of the amazons the 2007 storyline amazons attack depicted the amazons as having creatures such as giant stygen wasps and some domesticated winged horses large amounts of saddled chimeras and three titan sized ogres then in 2007 2008 the countdown to final crisis storyline introduced the then new revelation that the island is protected by a school of megalodons when writer gail simone took over the title she showed that hippolyta cared for griffins in the royal stables she also introduced the island of thalarion the home of gargareans during the rise of the olympian storyline the gargareans possessed herds of winged horses similar to themyscira but also possessed flocks of winged lions as well their leader achilles also has a domesticated war elephant named mysia who has two trunks two mouths three glowing eyes an impenetrable hide and the ability to walk on air as the gargareans incorporated themselves among the amazons of themyscira it is safe to assume these creatures also reside there notable citizens
