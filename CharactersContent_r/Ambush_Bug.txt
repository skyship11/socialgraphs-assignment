the plotting and offered up ambush bug as an antagonist the bug is entirely keith s creation 3 giffen has stated that both ambush bug and lobo were derived from lunatik a character he created in high

create another ambush bug story for dc comics presents 59 6 at first ambush bug was a villain named after a type of insect and dressed in a green skintight suit that covers his whole body with two orange antennae inside his hollow antennae he carries miniature robot bugs that possess the ability to teleport him around after attacking superman and other heroes ambush bug decides instead to be a superhero as well he also fancies himself superman s friend which only annoys the hero even more than his early villainy the costume then becomes permanently affixed to his body and he gains the power to teleport by himself while trying to fix one of the miniature bugs it explodes causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroys all of the bugs and tints ambush bug s costume temporarily black he then becomes capable of teleporting even without the bugs briefly considering changing his moniker to black beetle instead ambush bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries

have to say simon says to teleport but it is no longer necessary ambush bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers comic books he once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between firestorm s component personalities ambush bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the legion of substitute heroes with a single blow his unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents tactics and outmaneuver them
