clark kent while at galaxy vartox meets and falls in love with lana lang once superman s childhood sweetheart and modern day rival with lois lane for his affections by the time lana and vartox meet however she has abandoned her pursuit of superman as hopeless because she has accepted the reality that any true relationship with a man who literally took the responsibility of the world on his shoulders is all but impossible thus lana is struck hard by the bitter irony that vernon o valeron turns out to be another such man compounded by the fact that the world that vartox is committed to was an entirely different planet and one whose atmosphere is poisonous to earthlings syreena edit during another of vartox stays on earth lana is caught up in a complex revenge plot orchestrated by a former lover of vartox from valeron syreena wants payback for what she sees as vartox betrayal of her in truth his betrayal was arresting her for criminal acts committed with a siphoned portion of

energy phantom so that she can breathe in tynola s atmosphere she then makes it appear that an accidental ricochet of vartox hyper energy beams has turned lana to stone all the while she mentally manipulates vartox from afar appearing as her own ghost to render him irrational and unable to guess the truth in the end two things ruin syreena s plan one she accidentally leaves pieces of the amulet she had once given vartox which he had crushed upon learning its secret behind at one of her ghostly appearances giving him tangible proof of her survival and two deep down she still loves vartox and finds herself unable to deny him happiness syreena restores lana at a terrible cost the effect can not be dispelled only transferred dooming syreena to life as a stone statue however vartox and lana are forced to part once again the effect that would have let her live on tynola was apparently linked to the petrifaction effect and both are transferred away when lana was cured after saying
