on its cover that it was an origin issue almost no background on the character was given not even her name 4 until neil gaiman described her origin the character was known for her lack of an origin instead writers teased the audience with several possible origins all refuted in adventure comics 429 barry demorte hypothesizes that either yoga master lucinda cindy harper or anti gravity specialist daphne wingate is black orchid and he kidnaps both when black orchid comes to the rescue he learns otherwise in the phantom stranger 38 writer michael fleisher posited racecar driver ronnie kuhn as a possible secret identity for black orchid in the next issue kuhn is revealed to be simply an admirer of black orchid who is soon seduced into the black orchid legion molecular chemist karen jensen astrophysicist stefanie tower olympic gymnast and acrobat barbie henderson criminologist janet grant and psychologist and martial artist lisa patrick a group of criminals who developed suits that would mimic black orchid s powers because of her father s status as president of the world bank claiming that they are helping her to protect it from communists they bind her to the safe door which they have set with explosives black orchid rescues her and when the police arrest the legion one mistakes kuhn for black orchid claiming to know how it is with you super heroes 5 although super

kryptonian patrick tries to lure her to the meteorite display at the gotham city museum of natural history attracting the justice league black orchid places a force field around the kryptonite to

she answers earth 6 in blue devil annual 1 the usually reliable madame xanadu and phantom stranger provide competing origins for black orchid xanadu identifies her as madeleine moorcock and her origin is a parody of daredevil while the stranger identifies her as paula porter whose origin parodies spider man citation needed her appearances as an auxiliary member of the suicide squad are generally limited to brief rescues or bits of spying perhaps the most revealing issue is 19 in which she does not actually appear but a black orchid is found as evidence that she has been tapping into task force x s mainframe computer which arouses suspicion as she is there as support rather than as a rehabilitated criminal her disappearance was eventually noted by the squad in 1988 the character was relaunched in the three issue miniseries black orchid written by neil gaiman and illustrated by dave mckean the miniseries fleshed out the character considerably providing an origin story which explained how and why she became known as black orchid it also gave the character a civilian name in her origin sequence susan linden thorne instead of being a normal super powered human or metahuman in the dc universe her background was changed to be that of a human plant hybrid with ties to the green in this way she became related with other such human plant hybrids as the swamp thing floronic man and poison ivy 1 after the miniseries concluded dc comics intended to put black orchid in suicide squad as a comic relief character but replaced her with poison ivy after gaiman s objections gaiman had also wanted to write a sequel to that series called black orchard an ecological invasion of the body snatchers but it never materialized because he didn t want to make it without dave mckean or at least an artist he liked as much 7 susan linden had been killed by an abusive husband named carl thorne whom she met while a croupier in monaco she had been a teenage crush of botanist philip sylvain who later became a colleague to pamela isley alec swamp thing holland and linda holland when thorne became abusive she retreated to sylvain who cared for her until thorne succeeded in killing her sylvain used linden s dna as the source for plant human hybrids and kept an entire greenhouse full of them while working with the suicide squad flo crowley caught black orchid or rather her calling card after she accessed task force x s mainframes 8 she had been attempting to infiltrate lexcorp but her ruse was discovered she had been masquerading as a secretary but her wig and mask were removed to reveal her in her classic costume she was bound to a chair inside a burning building black orchid undid her bindings but died of smoke inhalation before she could escape her unrecognizable corpse was determined to be plant material by the fire department linden s consciousness was again killed by thorne this time a plant that merely thought that she was linden 9 thorne destroyed the greenhouse and killed sylvain leaving only two surviving hybrids 10 thorne pursued the survivors to brazil a squad sent by lex luthor to capture the hybrids kills thorne in self defense the survivors enamored by black orchid bury thorne and leave 11 flora black edit the surviving black orchids both having the consciousness and limited memories of linden become as mother and daughter
