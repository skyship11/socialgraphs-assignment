the behest of dc who saw it as likely to be more commercially successful than the fourth world and thus cancelled new gods and forever people to facilitate his working on the new title 3 according to mark evanier kirby had no interest in horror comics but created etrigan in response to a demand from dc for a horror character kirby was annoyed that the first issue sold so well that dc required him to do sixteen issues and abandon the fourth world titles before he was done with them 4 etrigan returned for a four issue miniseries in 1987 written and illustrated by grendel creator matt wagner alan grant followed this with an etrigan feature in action comics weekly 636 641 and a second ongoing title in 1990 the 1990 series lasted 58 issues two annuals and one 0 issue garth ennis took over the

with jason blood a knight in king arthur s camelot this renders jason immortal which he alternately considers either a penance or a curse in modern times jason blood resurfaces as a prominent demonologist in gotham city jason is called to the crypt of merlin and discovers a poem that causes him to switch places with etrigan appearing to transform him into etrigan to his misfortune he is followed by the long lived morgaine le fey who lusts for merlin s secrets that leads to etrigan s first major battle over the years etrigan both clashes with and occasionally aids earth s heroes guided by his own whims and jason s attempts to turn his infernal power to good use some time after his first appearance etrigan begins speaking in rhyme due to a promotion in hell 12 13 though he is not limited to rhyme 14 he leads the forces of hell in the great battle against the great evil beast and is in brief contact with the entity in its questions about its nature he barely survives the attempt 15 16 his high rank would also see him guide dream of the endless from hell s gates to lucifer some time after this jason blood and glenda mark attempt to separate blood and etrigan an event which leads to blood s ally harry matthews being devoured and later turned into a pillow by belial at the end of these events etrigan and blood are separated 17 both began to age and during the event known as cosmic odyssey blood and etrigan were merged once again 18 after the remerging the relationship between blood and etrigan becomes even more contentious drawn to hell by the archfiend asteroth etrigan stops asteroth s attempt to sacrifice glenda mark randu singh merlin and blood himself in hell blood and etrigan were at the time separated 19 etrigan followed these events by overthrowing the triumvirate of leaders in hell lucifer belial and beezlebub and taking the symbol of authority in hell the crown of horns for himself separated from blood via the crown s power and about to destroy him merlin reminded blood of his own power jason blood spoke the incantation and remerged with etrigan and they were drawn back to earth 20 there he fought lobo klarion the witch boy and his gang 21 and was drawn into the realm beyond where he met the thing that cannot die and was reunited with his older brother lord scapegoat 22 upon escape from the realm beyond 23 etrigan and blood agreed to work together and teamed with batman and robin against the howler 24 soon after etrigan was chosen as a political candidate for president of the united states and nearly succeeded in securing the republican nomination from george h w bush during his political run he attempted to gain superman s endorsement but was denied it 25 when jason blood s daughter was born he decided to destroy etrigan and hired metahuman hitman tommy monaghan to help him after a battle against both merlin and etrigan the two of them rescued the baby and blood was able to steal the demon s heart essentially neutralizing the demon and binding him to jason s will at the end of the battle to gain the demon s heart jason blood left the child kathryn mark with her mother glenda mark jason told glenda before he had left take care of our daughter glenda i think it would be best if she never knew about her father blood then skipped out on paying monaghan the 2 000 000 he had promised 26 etrigan became listless and ceased to rhyme when monaghan needed an edge against the demon mawzir he conned blood into returning to gotham and using etrigan to retrieve the ace of winchesters an anti demon rifle from hell all while preparing to force the demonologist to let the monster onto earth again despite the real risk that etrigan would kill him in vengeance monahgan traded etrigan his heart for the ace of winchesters once more forcing blood to have the full burden of their merging and returning etrigan to his full strength though etrigan reneged on the deal and tried to kill monaghan anyway 27 despite blood s own doubts about himself when the justice league vanished during their attempt to rescue aquaman from the past batman s emergency program designed to assemble a substitute justice league in the event that the originals were ever killed selected blood as the team s magic expert a pre recorded message batman had left for blood assuring the sorcerer that he would not give etrigan the keys to the watchtower unless he was certain that he could be controlled while working with the team jason spent some time reinforcing the watchtower s magical defences during the subsequent fight with gamemnae jason sacrificed himself to free zatanna from her control although he later escaped gamemnae s quagmire spell thanks to the martian manhunter telepathically prompting his transformation into etrigan 28 the crisis resolved jason handed his duties as the league s magic expert over to manitou raven newly arrived in the present before departing 29 the series blood of the demon plotted and drawn by john byrne and scripted by will pfeifer began in may 2005 etrigan apparently loses the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard merlin which turned him from evil caused by his murder at the exact moment he was transforming from his human self jason blood into his demon self it turns out that the incident has resulted in jason blood being able to exert some will over etrigan s violent nature whereas previously the two remained separate only one existing at a time blood of the demon ended with issue 17 in july 2006 etrigan later attempts to use the trident of lucifer to take control of hell a makeshift shadowpact team successfully takes the trident from him and flees to the supernatural oblivion bar etrigan follows and battles the team inside the bar he is turned into stone via magical pistols and is used as a hat rack the pistols magic would return etrigan to normal at sunrise which never happens within the bar 30 etrigan takes part in the war for control of hell on behalf of neron duelling blue devil later due to the effects of a magical drug satanus had infested hell with he was transformed into a soulless physical human a perfect duplicate of jason blood blood meanwhile has taken steps as to interfere with any possible attempts of etrigan s to re merge 31 during the blackest night event blood s body is possessed by deadman who invokes etrigan s transformation using his flames to hold back the black lanterns 32 etrigan briefly appears in the prelude to the jla jsa crossover during the brightest day event etrigan travels to germany in order to find a crashed meteorite that contains an unconscious jade and is drawn into a confrontation with the justice league after attacking a squad of german superheroes he mocks the league by claiming they are an inferior team of substitutes but is ultimately defeated when donna troy uses her lasso of persuasion to force him back into his jason blood form jason apologizes for the trouble he caused and departs from the scene but not before warning batman and his teammates that the meteorite possesses supernatural qualities the meteor is later revealed to be the starheart a legendary entity that has the power to possess metahumans with magical or elemental abilities 33 etrigan is shown aiding the jla during their mission into hell where he helps hawkman defeat a demonic beast 34 he also was the guide to the secret six in their trip to hell and led catman to see the fate of his father all the while amused by the confusion and pain they were suffering as a result of their visit the new 52 edit in the new 52 the 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe his past and origins are largely changed before the dark ages etrigan was a rhyming demon one not yet good at rhyming in lucifer s service and after too many indignities he led a rebellion lucifer waited until the last moment before handing him over to merlin the two had struck a deal jason of norwich had been sent to camelot as a scribe to merlin and was growing frustrated with life believing he was meant for greater things and suffering from rages a prophecy showed that if jason did not have some sort of quest to force him to heal himself his rage would grow and cause him to kill his love madame xanadu at the fall of camelot merlin bonded etrigan to jason in an attempt to provide this quest 35 now immortal jason and etrigan came to an agreement and shared their existence madame xanadu began traveling with jason only to find etrigan had now begun falling for her as well and would slaughter innocents if he thought she and jason were happy together in order to placate the demon she pretended to be in love with him and cuckolding jason 36 over the centuries jason became known as jason o the blood and etrigan continued to practice his rhymes by the dark ages he and etrigan became the centre of a rag tag team of adventurers the demon knights jason etrigan xanadu vandal savage shining knight the horsewoman saracen inventor al jabr the numbers in arabic and the amazon exoristos the exile in greek they first fought mordru and the questing queen s army to a standstill before being tasked by the city of alba sarum to return merlin to life at avalon both jason and etrigan were enraged at having missed the chance to get him to separate them etrigan plotted to betray his teammates souls and avalon itself to lucifer in order to curry his favour 37 while he successfully manipulated the knights into letting hell invade avalon and secretly felt guilty about his treatment of xanadu he was himself captured and used by the questing queen to gain access as well lucifer believed etrigan had done this deliberately and condemned him outraged the demon refused to serve anyone again at the end of the battle jason was tasked as a member of avalon s stormwatch but neither he nor xanadu wanted to serve merlin after having etrigan forced on them again jason vowed to not let the demon out so often 38 39 40 in the present etrigan s body lies buried in london it is explained that he was sealed there by his own friends because of his betrayal of them but magic emanating from it is able to possess persons above eventually freeing the demon who promptly attacks midnighter and apollo 41 the entire stormwatch then battles etrigan but even after being defeated he is able to possess a host and flees 42 during the trinity war storyline etrigan the demon is among the superheroes that feels the disturbance in the magical plane when shazam picks up pandora s box 43 in the timeline of the new 52 futures end zatanna is romantically involved with etrigan 44 45 characterization edit transformation incantation edit in order to transform into etrigan blood must recite the poem from merlin s crypt though usually he only recites the last two lines the poem does not have to be spoken for it to work for instance in one adventure blood is magically transformed into a fly unable to speak blood triggers the change by writing out the poem in the dust 46 change change o form of man free the prince forever damned free the might from fleshy mire boil the blood in the heart for fire gone gone o form of man and rise the demon etrigan to return to human form a couplet must be recited either by etrigan or someone else in his hearing but there are several versions of it begone begone o etriganresume once more the form of man gone now o etriganand rise again or rise once more the form of man in other media such as the justice league dark animated film a different poem is used to return etrigan to human form since the battle s fought and won jason blood with me is done powers and abilities edit etrigan edit even among demons etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful he has mystically enhanced superhuman strength to the degree that he can stand against other powerhouses such as superman wonder woman and lobo he has a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body usually from his mouth he has a very high command of magic other powers include mystically enhanced fangs and claws enhanced senses super speed agility telepathy energy blasts and precognition his sadomasochistic nature allows him to enjoy pain as if it were pleasure making him generally fearless in the face of combat and torture his healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage allowing him to recover from wounds that have removed large sections of his body he also has pyrokinesis and cryokinesis enabling him to manipulate fire and ice jason blood edit jason blood is a highly skilled hand to hand combatant including mastery in swordsmanship jason is adept at magic and is often called upon to act as an advisor or investigator in occultic matters he has limited precognition and telepathy jason is technically immortal due to his connection to the demon etrigan he has the combined experiences of etrigan since he was bonded to the demon jason blood shares all of etrigan s weaknesses weaknesses limitations edit etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon including a weakness towards holy powers holy water and iron while his command of magic is strong but considered to be less than his father belial and half brother merlin the magician additionally belial granted the power of etrigan to both merlin and another son lord scapegoat he is also helpless against those with magical powers strong enough to control him such as morgaine le fey he is also said to have a strong frailty for certain sounds as well other versions edit in

amalgamation of the second flash the second ghost rider and etrigan speed demon even refers to himself as etrigan the way etrigan empowers speed demon is reminiscent of marvel comics zarathos a demon who was bonded to ghost rider in a similar manner in batman demon a tragedy etrigan has been bonded to bruce wayne for a thousand years with alfred pennyworth the cover identity adopted by merlin as part of his atonement for summoning etrigan all those centuries ago kept contained by bruce wayne s virtue etrigan only attacks criminals when released but this depends on bruce s ignorance of his condition with alfred merlin constantly re casting the relevant spells to disguise bruce as his own descendant and erasing his memories of his true existence to keep etrigan contained etrigan appeared in the superman and batman vs vampires and werewolves storyline aiding batman and superman in tangent superman s reign 3 the etrigan of earth 9 is revealed to be a human necromancer part of the dark
