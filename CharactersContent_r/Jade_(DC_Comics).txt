a counterattack eclipso destroys the moon apparently dooming all life on earth with the moon destroyed eclipso then seemingly kills donna troy the physically strongest remaining member of the justice

unlimited green energy constructs to life she can use the constructs in any way limited only by her will imagination and endurance she uses the constructs most often to create shields to fly to travel through outer space and to run very quickly jade s power often manifests as green fire jade is unable to affect any object made of wood jade inherited from her mother the ability to affect plants jade can cause accelerated growth of plants and manipulate the movement of most plant life this ability manifests later in her life and thus she is less familiar with it technically speaking jade is a meta human she was born with green hued skin dark green hair green eyes and a star shaped birthmark on her palm her skin contains chlorophyll the source of its green hue and she can photosynthesize sunlight as a plant does due to their shared mystical connection with the starheart jade can sense where her twin brother and her father are she once shared a telepathic connection with her brother as a member of the green lantern corps jade wielded a power ring its power is not from the starheart but from an aspect of the emotional spectrum the power ring gave jade abilities which were similar to her natural powers it required recharging every 24 hours by her power battery jade s ring has a yellow impurity which required her to face her fears and overcome them with green willpower in order to
