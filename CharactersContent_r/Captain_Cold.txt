and the rogues make their first full length appearance in the flash vol 5 15 where they are attempting to steal a valuable golden statue of the god mercury from the small island nation of corto maltese the flash arrives to stop them but they turn out to be constructs of mirror master laid so that the rogues can commit a crime spree in central city captain cold reveals what he had been working on in his absence from the city a black ice gun that uses the anti speed force weaponry of the terrorist group black hole combined with his regular freeze gun after a fight the golden glider

the villains that attend the underground meeting held by riddler that talks about the superman theory 23 powers and abilities edit like the majority of the flash s rogues snart had no innate superhuman powers he instead relied on his cold guns and instincts over the years snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as a cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks cold uses this ability to slow down the flash s movements bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain cold used this to kill chillblaine who murdered cold s sister to make him suffer as much as possible creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the flash forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies used to kill chillblaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible an ice grenade which was stated to turn this place into an iceberg used to freeze everything in a large radius and the whole of iron heights during the events of blackest night creating mirages out of extreme cold like heat fellow ice based villain mr freeze has noted that cold is the only cold themed villain in the dc universe to have mastered absolute zero with his weapons in the new 52 universe captain cold temporarily had meta human ice powers including the power to slow down the flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by absolute zero but these powers are later lost in the forever evil series when he is attacked by deathstorm the earth 3 counterpart of firestorm with cold reverting to using his classic ice gun despite his lack of professional or technical expertise cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop 24 he s even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers like his cold field which quick cools the atmosphere to the point that everything caught in it grinds to a halt 25 or an auto activation function which triggers his cold gun s freeze ray via vocalized password input 22 during the rebirth storyline snart augmented his cold gun even further by combining it with the anti speed force technologies by the science criminal cell called black hole 26 the newly christened black ice gun now tacked directly into the speed force in order to painfully disrupt a speedster s connection to it snart s new cold gun was so powerful that not only could it hinder the flash in the most excruciating way possible it was vastly more powerful in scope able to freeze both the harbor and several city blocks adjacent to their current location 27 other versions edit captain cold appears in darwyn cooke s series dc the new
