appearance in our army at war 168 was in a sgt rock story i knew the unknown soldier written by robert kanigher and drawn by joe kubert kubert who also edited the dc comics line of war comics at the time decided that the character was interesting enough to be featured in his own series which began some years later in star spangled war stories running from issues 151 june july 1970 to 204 february 1977 2 eventually star spangled war comics began featuring the soldier exclusively with issue 205 may 1977 the book changed its title to the unknown soldier 3 continuing the numbering and running for another 64 issues ending with 268 october 1982 the series takes place during world war ii and focuses on the missions of a united states intelligence agent code named the unknown soldier whose head and face are so severely disfigured that he typically has it completely wrapped in heavy bandages despite this he is a master of disguise who can assume the identity of almost any man using latex masks and make up however his disguises occasionally itch where they meet the scar tissue of his face forcing him to be conscious not to give himself away by scratching he is also prone to loss of

actually been shot in the head before ever reaching kony in a symbolic conclusion of his morality arc it turns out that he didn t kill a single person in kony s camp instead throwing its garrison of
