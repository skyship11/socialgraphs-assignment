legion to combat the menace of the sun eater once the sun eater was defeated she joined the fatal five with tharok validus mano and the persuader 2 the empress had no innate super powers rather she employed a powerful mystical item called the emerald eye of ekron an approximately 2 diameter sphere that obeyed her mental commands 3 the eye could fly and emit blasts of energy and allowed the empress to fly as well as survive in space the eye s residual energy also gave her on at least one occasion super strength it caused her to grow to gigantic stature during one battle the eye could also reform itself if shattered the eye is an item of immense power it defeated superboy who is susceptible to magic generally more than once though it seemed to have more trouble with mon el perhaps because he was immune to green kryptonite and its blasts may have contained elements of it despite this for unknown reasons the eye does not like green kryptonite and being exposed to a chunk of it has made the eye flee on more than one occasion leaving the empress behind temporarily the emerald empress died when at her request legionnaire sensor girl used her powers of illusion to mask sarya s presence from the emerald eye of ekron as the empress body quickly withered and decomposed she expressed relief to be free from the eye s control indicating both that their symbiotic relationship was unwilling and that the empress was far older than she appeared 4 final crisis edit during final crisis the emerald empress alongside the other fatal five members was among the supervillains in superboy prime s legion of super villains dc rebirth edit the emerald empress appears as one of max lord s super villains in justice league vs suicide squad during dc rebirth empress was part of the first suicide squad along with lobo johnny sorrow rustam and doctor polaris the empress was manipulated by amanda waller by potential information about saturn girl when the first mission ended in disaster empress and the others were imprisoned they were later freed by maxwell as part of his own plan for domination empress escaped this multi layered plan with her eye severely damaged this endangered her plan to stay in the current time realizing she might need help she pondered recruiting four other allies 5 cera kesh edit cera kesh first appears in legionnaires 2 slightly overweight and with poor skin she was also telekinetic and sought to join the legion through their open audition program mocked by legion member inferno for whom she harbored an infatuation for her appearance kesh fled in embarrassment and anger and was found by the emerald eye transformed by it into an idealized version of herself and with all the powers of the eye boosting her own she succumbed to the eye s influence and turned to a life of crime with the other members of the fatal five at the same time leland mccauley found a second emerald eye with which he hoped to turn ingria olav into the new emerald empress instead cera killed her and gained the power of both eyes she was not seen again as the timeline she was a part of ended shortly thereafter falyce edit in legion of super heroes vol 6 annual 1 2011 the eye finds a new empress on the planet of orando this young girl fights shrinking violet light lass sun boy sensor girl and gates of the legion before being defeated by violet the girl was released from the eye s control but the eye itself managed to flee the planet emerald eye of ekron edit starfire wielding the emerald eye in 52 52 origin edit according to the year spanning maxiseries 52 2006 the eye was once a real eye for the cosmic entity called ekron 6 but somehow emerald empress got the eye and got it to work for her 7 8 in the present the emerald eye has appeared in the pages of 52 in the possession of lobo and in the brave and the bold back in the hands of the emerald empress lobo kept the item in a small chest under his supervision unwilling to use its powers when starfire used the eye to save the population of sector 3500 from a swarm of strange creatures lobo revealed that he knew something about the origins of the eye an emerald head of ekron also existed and was searching for its lost eyeball ekron is apparently a member of the green lantern corps but has been driven insane by the destruction of the space sector under his protection by lady styx the emerald eye itself is later revealed as a precursor of the technology that later led to the power ring worn by all green lanterns with less functionality but nevertheless a formidable weapon other origins edit when the eye was reintroduced in the legion of super heroes vol 6 annual of 2011 none of this was acknowledged rather ekron was referred to as a world where the eye had once been worshipped as a god the 52 explanation also neglects any existence of the eye wielded by garryn bek of l e g i o n in the 21st century powers and abilities edit standalone abilities edit the first incarnation of the emerald empress sarya possessed limited independent abilities possessing greater than average human strength a trait possessed by inhabitants of venagar much of her abilities are centered upon the emerald eye of ekron in which she controls through her own mind and willpower having a symbiotic relationship with the artifact she draws power from it while the eye draws focus and both are more powerful the closer they are 9 10 cera kesh the second incarnation of the emerald empress possessed telekinesis powers through the emerald eye of ekron edit each user of the emerald eye of ekron gains access to its nearly unlimited levels of emerald willpower energies the same power source used by the green lantern corps making the artifact both indestructible and considered uncontainable due to its usage of the same willpower emerald energy sources it is considered related to the oan s power battery used by the green lantern corps 9 10 its powers include granting its users the ability to fly and survive in the vacuum of space generate protective force fields project blasts strong enough to hurt kryptonians create energy constructs hypnotize others and teleport over short distances it can also grant superhuman strength size manipulation cast illusions alter reality see through every spectrum and wavelength instantly reform itself if shattered enhance any innate skills that its current user has and keep its user young and beautiful other versions edit ingria olav edit ingria olav was a short lived emerald empress who was the girlfriend of legion of super heroes foe leland mccauley iv having discovered the second eye of ekron he recreated a fatal five team with ingria serving as the team s new emerald empress however ingria proved to be more cowardly and an unskilled user of the eye of ekron being unable to stomach the life of a super villainess she is later tracked down by cera kesh the other emerald empress and is vaporized by the woman whom then takes the second eye of ekron for herself the empress post zero hour edit after the zero hour event and the subsequent reboot of the legion s continuity a character simply called the empress appeared unconnected to the emerald eye of ekron which appeared separately later although she had no powers she was as dangerous as the rest of the fatal five being a sadistic murderess who had taught herself how to kill any known lifeform the eye itself was in possession of the supervillain scavenger but was discovered by shrinking violet who fell under its control with the legion s help violet managed to break the eye s hold on her but not before she had sent half the team into the past and attracted the attention of the ancient sorcerer mordru eventually the eye came into the hands of the empress the empress seemed to have broken the eye s will leaving her unequivocally in control this version of the legion is still in continuity but now established as taking place on a parallel world which means that this eye is not the same as the one the original legion encountered but the eye of an alternate universe reception edit emerald empress was ranked 38th in comics buyer s guide s 100 sexiest women in comics list 11 russ burlingame of comicbook com described her as a big player in the dc universe of late and that she s one of the most identifiable legion villains with a cool

of emerald empress appeared in the episode far from home of justice league unlimited voiced by joanne whalley 13 in that episode the eye s power proved to be stronger than a green lantern power ring emerald empress from the legion of super heroes the sarya version of emerald empress appears in legion of super heroes voiced by jennifer hale in season one and tara strong from then on as in the comics the emerald eye of ekron is the source of her mystic powers some clues to this version s relationship with the eye can be observed in the first season finale sundown she had been separated from it for some time during her imprisonment and hugged it when it was returned to her suffered no physical effects when shrinking violet damaged its circuitry from within once the fatal five betrayed the legion nor when matter eater lad took a bite out of it in the season two premiere though its destruction has left her powerless biting into it damaged matter eater lad s mind leaving him in a near comatose state for most of the season though not appearing in batman the brave and the bold the emerald empress is referenced in the super batman of planet x batman mentions to green arrow that the
