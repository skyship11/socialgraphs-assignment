very mysterious à la phantom stranger i took that as a starting point and using the shadow face where half her face is always in shadow despite the lighting was a shtick i obviously got from phantom stranger who also had the same deal he had a long billowing cape as did she and in her case since her name was raven i decided to create a silhouette for her that would look like a bird the hood was designed so that in the profile it would end up looking like a birds head so that when her soul self came out since that was done in full black it looked like a gigantic black raven her name and the phantom stranger were key to how i designed her 2 perez was asked if the characters face was based on any real life person perez stated the following originally raven was persis khambatta the actress who played in the first star trek film and later became a young lady named fran macgregor who was a dancer and i used some of her features particularly for her figure for raven fictional character
