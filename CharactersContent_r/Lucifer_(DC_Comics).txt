mind control shapeshifting lucifer samael morningstar is a character who appears in american comic books published by dc comics he is an adaptation of lucifer the biblical fallen angel and devil of christianity and is one of the most powerful beings in the dc universe though various versions of the devil have been presented by dc comics this interpretation by neil gaiman debuted in the sandman 4 in 1989 lucifer appears primarily as a supporting character in the sandman and as the protagonist of the spin off lucifer the ongoing lucifer spin off series 2000 2006 written by mike carey depicts his adventures on earth heaven and in the various other realms of his family s creations and in uncreated voids after abandoning hell in the sandman 1 lucifer also appears as a supporting character in issues of the demon the spectre and other dc universe comics two angels a human and briefly superman 2 have taken his place as ruler of hell lucifer made his live action debut in the 2005 film

while lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier dc comics books gaiman s version was premised on english poet and prose writer john milton s paradise lost citation needed at gaiman s request of the artist lucifer looks like david bowie at the time 3 in the sandman lucifer had ruled as lord of hell for 10 billion years after rebelling three seconds after creation over that time he had manipulated the various demons of hell against each other provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented and led the war against heaven however at some point during his rule he had become bored with his existence he became tired of the various stereotypes and prejudices that mortals held of the devil such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls which was largely untrue and that he forced mortals to commit evil acts he had become tired of his reign over hell and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled in the sandman story season of mists lucifer expels all the demons and damned souls from hell before closing hell s gates and handing over the key to hell to dream of the endless the title character of the sandman series eventually control of hell was handed over to two angels duma the angel of silence and remiel set over those who rise while lucifer simply retired to earth initially to perth western australia 4 and later to los angeles california 5 by the end of the series however it is revealed that hell was not a punishment but a gift being the furthest possible place from the throne of light lucifer could be separated from god as far as possible lucifer never created the physical features of hell hell created itself around him solo series edit lucifer was the main character in an eponymous series that ran for 75 issues plus the lucifer nirvana one shot issue from june 2000 to august 2006 the entire run of which was written by mike carey this series was preceded by carey s the sandman presents lucifer miniseries in 1999 to carey the essence of the character was we play safe most of us do most of the time but lucifer doesn t know the meaning of safe and he never bothers to look down at the tramlines he does whatever the hell he likes picks his fights where he finds them and generally wins following his own will and his own instincts to the very end of the line no matter what the obstacles are 6 in the series lucifer runs a piano bar an element introduced in the sandman story the kindly ones called lux in los angeles lucifer is portrayed as a sophisticated and charming man in accordance with the stereotypical gentleman devil 1 the theme of the lucifer series revolves around the free will problem carey s lucifer is a figure representing the will and individual willpower who challenges the tyranny of predestination while in heaven s eyes this is blasphemy lucifer points out that the rebellion and indeed all sin and damnation as consequence were pre planned by his creator god lucifer rejects god s rule and moral philosophy as tyrannical and unjust the violent aggressive totalitarian vengeful and dictatorial aspects of heaven s rule are represented mostly by the angel amenadiel who has a particular hatred of lucifer and leads attacks of various kinds against him the attacks include verbal criticism marshaling the host of heaven as well as challenging him to individual combat almost all of it without the slightest care for the countless innocent unwilling and unwitting victims that he is more than willing to sacrifice for his own pride for his part lucifer disdains amenadiel treating the latter s emotional outbursts with contempt and repeatedly defeats amenadiel s assaults with well orchestrated hidden plans ironically however it is often difficult to discern when lucifer acts as a slave to predestination and when he effectively acts according to his own free will elaborate codes of conduct and schemes of entrapment based on these codes are vital elements of the dc vertigo magical universe lucifer appears as a master of these arts in an encounter during the first sandman story arc around issue 5 a weakened dream outsmarts lucifer lucifer first swears revenge on dream but later comes to accept dream s critique of his role and project as lord of hell this inspires lucifer s abdication a vital element of the sandman saga and the point of departure for the lucifer series 1 for lucifer his word is his bond as david easterman a character who sees himself as a victim of lucifer puts it when the devil wants you to do something he doesn t lie at all he tells you the exact literal truth and he lets you find your own way to hell 7 despite his theological title as the lord of lies the refusal to lie is central to the moral position of the character he sees himself as a neutral or amoral facilitator of forces within individuals and lucifer actively and effectively combats what he regards as corrupting moral codes while he avoids lying his morality seldom extends to compassion and lucifer regards the sacrifice of millions of souls as unimportant collateral damage there are few if any beings that he respects and even fewer for whom he cares as the series opened in 2000 lucifer s restful retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past after various catalytic events he endeavored to create a universe in competition with and presumably against the wishes of his father yahweh this puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray including his brother the archangel michael demiurgos and his niece elaine belloc the series paralleled the sandman in several ways with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by one shot episodes depicting a smaller more personal tale unlike the sandman the series has had a consistent art team in peter gross and ryan kelly with most of the odd issues illustrated by dean ormston the title s 50th issue was penciled by p craig russell a homage to the sandman 50 structurally the series mostly follows its own path numerous gods appear with greater focus on judeo christian religion as viewed by milton in paradise lost japanese mythology and norse mythology than in the sandman as for the endless themselves dream death delirium and destiny appear but their appearances are small and rare destiny perhaps plays the biggest role in so far as he represents predestination which lucifer of course finds offensive as a concept stating that lucifer knows destiny is really just a side effect of lucifer s father or rather his deterministic approach to the act of creation cover artists included duncan fegredo christopher moeller and michael william kaluta the letters are inconsistent with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of gaudium michael and god only to drop almost all of them save lucifer s towards the end with numerous changes in the letterers the series ended in june 2006 with issue 75 and has thus far been collected in 11 books with a one shot issue lucifer nirvana published as a smaller graphic novel the series parent title the sandman also ran for 75 issues when lucifer ventures outside creation he sees something resembling the comics pages themselves at the end of the lucifer story arc god and the devil are no longer part of the universe and a former human elaine belloc is instead presiding over it new concepts for heaven and hell are created inspired and influenced by other human or superhuman characters in the story the new situation is described on several occasions by the fallen cherubs gaudium and spera in essence it is growing up i e the need to find one s own truth and values without being directed by parents elders teachers authority figures etc lucifer himself his whole identity having been forged by that same motive scoffs at his father s final offer to merge their beings described by god as a potlatch so that they can finally understand one another s perspective as this would be the final expression of god s will even when delivered from outside the plan as he puts it lucifer finds the ultimate expression of his own defiant will by refusing the bargain and travelling beyond his father s influence into the undefined void the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline lucifer is much more influenced by traditional christian theology he is depicted as a malevolent sadistic and cunning fallen angel who is the ruler of hell and seeks to possess human souls he is held with great respect and fear by the denizens of hell who serve and obey him like a king lucifer himself however is mostly bored with his existence when the group known as the demon knights are captured by him during the early middle ages and passes the time by finding small amusements such as watching the struggles and falls of etrigan the demon lucifer made a more physical appearance in i vampire 19 after being tipped by john constantine in destroying cain lucifer immediately sentences cain and drags him to hell though a being claiming to be him has appeared in the modern age of dc comics to the superhero deadman note the versions of lucifer michael gabriel cain and abel in mainstream new 52 are not of the same continuity as the versions in the previous or later lucifer comics and are currently noncanonical to the vertigo sandman lucifer hellblazer continuity in which lucifer is not ruling hell and cain has not been destroyed or banished to hell in fact cain restored to his original new earth version appeared in dc s dark nights metal 2 as a member of the immortal men with his brother abel cain abel gabriel and lucifer the pre flashpoint versions currently appear in the sandman universe comics from vertigo cain abel daniel hall dream and lucien also appeared in dcs dark nights metal in these forms re establishing their pre new 52 incarnations in both dc and vertigo volume 2 2015 2017 edit this volume continues from where lucifer left off before the new 52 the new 52 version not being canon to this continuity as this series begins god is dead and gabriel has accused lucifer of his murder lucifer had motive and opportunity but claims he can prove his innocence if gabriel finds the killer and takes the culprit into custody his sins will be forgotten and he will be welcomed back into the silver city despite the fact that lucifer has just opened a nightclub on earth and is hiding a mysterious wound the two brothers set off to solve their father s murder note this version is not considered canon to the lucifer comics starting in late 2018 those will continue from where the mike carey continuity ended 8 9 powers and abilities edit lucifer is continuously described as a celestial being of incalculable power due to his dominion over the very substance and knowledge of the formation of creation through this understanding lucifer can shape the matter and foundation of the creation into anything he can imagine including matter energy and more abstract concepts such as time he once shaped big bang energies released by the death of his brother michael into a new universe 10 however he does have certain limitations as he is still a creation of god chiefly he cannot create something out of nothing unlike his creator or brother in some ways this makes him the most disadvantaged though not the weakest of the higher angelic host he needs existing matter and where that is unavailable the demiurgic power of the archangel michael or that of god himself to provide the foundation for him to shape in certain dimensions for reasons unknown he is powerless and his mobility is limited without his wings he is also not unbeatable as basanos was able to kill him with probability manipulation he may choose to temporarily abandon his powers including his immortality in the story titled lilith it is logically implied that god could destroy him at his own whim which makes lucifer sometimes wonder why he has not dealt with him already he is so dangerous and unpredictable that even death does not apply to him he is also able to draw out a human s deepest desires but due to his belief in free will allows them to choose whether or not they should act on them even if they make the choice on an unconscious level lucifer always tells the truth but much like other trickster deities and spirits will sometimes conveniently omit key details to fool others into doing something wrong he is never without the formidable resources of his brilliant intellect and his unbending will or inner strength which allowed him to defy and confront his father as well as many other formidable opponents without fear or doubt although lucifer s overt exercise of power is limited in the books if he is provoked to violence his preference seems to be to use fire and light as a weapon his original role was as god s lamplighter in which he used his will to condense clouds of hydrogen into star masses and set them alight as terrifying as they are brief battles with lucifer usually begin and end with him drawing down the flames of a super heated main sequence star and incinerating to ash anything in the immediate area however the true reasons why he favors light and fire are partially explained in the story lilith from the wolf beneath the tree beyond his godly powers as an archangel lucifer possesses the common powers appropriate to an archangel of his position superhuman strength superhuman durability flight acidic blood or rather he bleeds willpower as depicted in when he reaches yggdrasil in the wolf beneath the tree a devastating sonic cry telepathy and the power to speak to and understand animals in addition he is a psychopomp able to bring back from death any individual who he himself has slain as an archangel his powers are significantly superior to other angels according to mike carey lucifer didn t want to be his mouth piece more than any other character he ever written lucifer insisted on going his own way it s safe to say that lucifer is even above the writer dream said saving only the creator lucifer is the most powerful being there is and dream knows everything means only the creator can beat lucifer rest can not in the new 52 reboot lucifer is shown to be significantly less powerful often using hell s armies to do his bidding and is susceptible to magic shown when excalibur was used to cut off his hand he has no power over animal souls he can open and close magical portals to earth from hell and back again he can use this power to either summon or banish demons as he does with etrigan he is clairvoyant possessing a heightened perception or knowledge of time even to the extent of being able to know the future other versions edit the unofficial guide to the dc universe lists lucifer as first having appeared in a dream in superman s pal jimmy olsen 65 1962 11 he appears when jimmy olsen attempts to memorize a devil s food cake recipe with his alleged photographic memory and dreams that he is in france 300 years in the past putting on the clothing of a bandit who has ditched them jimmy is arrested and sent to rot in the devil s island penal colony a bald man known as lord l offers five years of freedom for people to escape in exchange for their souls convinced that the magic the man uses is technological in nature assuming him to be an ancestor of lex luthor he asks to be returned whence he came believing lord l will be long dead by then and unable to claim him lord l shows up at his front door still bald but now with a goatee and insists that he is lucifer and has given him over 300 years extra but will dine with him before taking him but disappears when jimmy serves him cake superman wakes jimmy soon after and reveals that the card he memorized was really for angel food cake and this is why lucifer disappeared in weird mystery tales 4 january february 1973 a story by jack oleck and ruben yandoc depicts lucifer looking much like his present incarnation save for a few panels in which he appeared as a more traditional devil held prisoner by an order of monks it also presents a prisoner switch trick not unlike the one performed in the sandman season of mists in addition to being hosted by destiny another character later used by gaiman in the story lucifer gave philip burton his form in order to trade places with him and fulfill his wish for immortality lucifer walked away in the body of the elderly burton a character called lucifer the fallen angel appears in blue devil 31 the final issue of the series he has angelic wings and a halo and his face includes dark facial hair he does not have horns madame xanadu recognizes that even with a magic book he is not the real lucifer he is simply a washed up actor who decided to be a costumed criminal for a living he is dragged into hell on a train at the end of the issue the unofficial guide to the dc universe lists lucifer s first genuine pre crisis appearance as dc special series 8 11 this character has hair and wings like lucifer as he appears in the sandman vol 2 4 but he is red skinned and has a face like a traditional devil complete with a goatee though his horns may be part of a headband his appearance in the comic is brief but he is specifically referred to as lucifer rather than by other epithets he has an advisory board consisting of guy fawkes benedict arnold adolf hitler jack the ripper nero and bluebeard he has an operative edward dirkes set bombs while using a bronze batman statue transported by the easy company like a voodoo doll writer garth ennis introduced a character intended to be the devil as an antagonist in his run on the hellblazer comic however as the character appeared at the same time as gaiman s reuse of the lucifer character ennis had to introduce a new back story for his character to distinguish the two the hellblazer character was named the first of the fallen and was ruler of hell both prior to and after lucifer s reign how this fits in with the reigns of the angels and christopher rudd has not been clarified although the first of the fallen mentions duma and remiel ruling hell during ennis run in the hellblazer film adaption constantine however lucifer portrayed by peter stormare is an antagonist satan has appeared as a distinct figure in numerous dc comics 12 in one of vertigo s fables spinoffs jack of fables the title character made various unwise pacts with several devils one of them is heavily inspired by milton s paradise lost reception edit in 2010 ign s named lucifer as the 68th
