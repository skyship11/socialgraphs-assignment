villain who manipulates traumatised children on the grounds that she will make them stronger through trauma although cassandra had been sent to kill both of harper s parents and only killed her mother before she found she couldn t do it mother had harper s mother murdered as part of a plan to offer harper to batman as the perfect robin batman had made contact with her to try and expose her long term agenda and believed that he was meant to kill the parents of the new robin mother had chosen for him when actually he was just sent after two of mother s other disciples as a test of his loyalty to her ideals while harper s parents were attacked in gotham despite recognising harper s qualities would make her an ideal partner at the time batman simply forced her surviving father to take responsibility for his role as a parent as he didn t want to benefit from mother s plan 10 never revealing the truth even after harper began working with him as bluebird mother attempts to win harper to her point of view by arguing that her own family fell apart so that she had to rise up on her own offering to let harper kill cassandra cain after revealing that cassandra was the one who killed her mother 11 but harper rejects that idea proclaiming that she grew up because her mother supported and recognised her desire for a better life rather than trying to make harper be what her mother believed would work following mother s defeat harper assures the returned batman that she understands his reasons for not telling her about his history with mother and his indirect role in her mother s death but recent events have prompted her to go to college to receive official qualifications for her electrician skills and explore a life outside of the vigilante role although batman assures her
