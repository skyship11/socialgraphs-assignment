due to its malfunctioning in his new body the brain confesses to mallah he is in love with him when mallah reveals he feels the same way the two kiss however robotman s body having developed sentience and vowed never to be enslaved by a brain again triggers a self destruct mechanism and explodes as they kiss 8 1 the two later resurface the brain back to floating in a jar with no explanation of how they survived the explosion the brotherhood begins raiding genetic research facilities to unlock the secrets of cloning and create a new body for the brain so he and monsieur mallah can resume their romance 9 10 11 after a short while the brain s new clone body begins to break down so he has mallah rip off his head and put his brain back into another jar 12 in the salvation run storyline brain and monsieur mallah appear amongst the villains that were sent to the planet cygnus 4019 an altercation between monsieur mallah and gorilla grodd ends with grodd beating monsieur mallah to death with brain s chassis also killing brain in the process 13 in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this continuity brain was originally a new england scientist named ernst who experimented on a gorilla named mallah to increase his intellect he treated mallah like a friend and an assistant when an explosion occurred in his lab ernst was badly burned and mallah saved his life by preserving his brain 14 after becoming distrustful of humans brain took mallah into attacking humans that they blamed for their plight then they raided lexcorp where they received a cyber optic nerve so that brain can see during a standoff with the special crimes unit maggie sawyer tried to talk them down and agreed to help them if they surrendered 15 in an alternate future of this new timeline brain and monsieur mallah assist gorilla grodd in taking over the remains of central city at the time when the black had taken over most of the world they capture animal man and the heroes that are with him animal man s group is saved by frankenstein and his patchwork army 16 he reappears in dc rebirth the brotherhood of evil worked together on a narcotic element which is then distributed to the addict population of new york city 17 the designer drug bliss in actuality was designed to put people in a fugue state so brain could use their dormant mental capacity as a type of cloud space to expand his own intellect into godlike territories 18 in record time brain and monsieur mallah spearheaded their opiate both from a purer sample that they created and through faulty counterfeits fabricated by the rival underlife both having purposely leaked the original formula on the black market then enlisted the mercenary cheshire to steal back their original concoction while furthering the goal of expanding brain s intelligence 19 as his acumen began to reach hyper genius levels of intellectual capacity the brain began to physically transcend his mortal coil at varying percentages over time 10 15 enabling him to solve unsolvable mathematic formulas while masking his and monsieur mallah s operation 23 giving him power over climate change and weather patterns 47 enabling natural disaster cosmological force phenomena manipulation and so on and so forth as his mental abilities increased more and more with time he situated ecological catastrophes as bait to lure his enemies in the justice league towards various traps while he worked towards achieving transcendent consciousness 20 his ascent to godhood also came with the side effect of nullifying his empathy becoming personally distant from the humanistic coil such as relations and his dearest confidante to that end mallah betrayed brain to the titans before he could reshape reality to his own ends ending the threat he posed for good 21 brain retired from the villain life and went to go see faye gunn about the ad for a teacher she didn t trust him due to his villainous association with the brotherhood of evil 22 14 she did encourage brain to know the generation outlaws better 23 during the year of the villain joker imprisoned brain and monsieur mallah in an old fair ground at the time when the batman who laughs was infecting people joker tortured them and left their care in lex luthor s hands in exchange for the knowledge to defeat the batman who laughs 24 powers and abilities edit one of the most formidable villains ever encountered by the doom patrol or even in dc comics the brain is more of a cerebral opponent but all the more dangerous for it a former polymath the brain has a genius level iq which he puts to use as a criminal mastermind and is more than capable of plotting out perfect crimes the brain is completely single minded and motivated almost entirely towards the domination of others the committing of even more perfect crimes and ultimate revenge against niles caulder adept in psychology he is also a master of coercion deceit and manipulation being able to persuade almost anybody to do his dirty work for him even to the point where his agents are under the illusion that they are not actually committing evil or immoral acts it is however hinted that it is a result of mind control through telepathy by the brain it was through these cerebral abilities that the brain was able to unite various villains under his leadership forming the brotherhood of evil although others often act as brawns to his brain most notably his assistant partner monsieur mallah the brain has occasionally used agile robotic bodies to give him mobility the different contraptions which have been seen to hold his brain were designed by the brain himself also a master in biology and robotics and have proved time and time again to be durable and even nigh indestructible on the rare occasion when the brain has been vulnerable without robotic protection or assistance from other villains he has protected himself by attacking opponents through telekinesis except for the times when he possesses robot bodies the brain is portrayed as an ordinary human brain albeit housed within what could be described as a life sized chess piece which contains the equipment required to keep him alive it is this portrayal that was adapted in the animated versions of the brain as mentioned in this article in the original doom patrol series he was regularly portrayed as a disembodied brain bobbing inside a sealed dome filled with a nutrient bath hooked up with numerous machines including a loudspeaker to convey his voice during a confrontation with the newly formed justice league and the doom patrol the brain used genetics equipment provided by the mysterious locus organization to steal the martian manhunter s eyes black canary s vocal cords the flash s legs and green lantern s right arm granting him access to the manhunter s vision abilities canary s sonic scream the flash s speed and green lantern s power ring however during this time he was only ever shown using the ring and was caught off guard by its vulnerability to yellow with aquaman eventually managing to overpower the brain s will and use the ring to sever him from his makeshift body in rebirth the brain found a way to increase his intelligence by tapping some several hundred thousand people s vacant thought spaces to achieve mental divinity not only showcasing increased cognizant genius but obtaining various superpowers accessed via the power of his mind alone as a result 25 having solved ordlich s heuristic paradox and deciphered the voynich manuscript while masking his whereabouts from outside detection changing and manipulating weather patterns via remote climate alteration engineering natural disasters manipulating cosmic quantum force casting himself into technology alla cyborg superman twist space time and manipulating reality by sheer force of will 21 other characters named brain edit dc comics previously had other villains named the brain the first villain was an ordinary criminal who earned his nickname for his cleverness and was not literally just a brain he alongside captain bigg hopper false face and rattler were one of five small time villains hired by black star to commit

to do very little during the series and acts behind the scenes coordinating the villain attacks when he appears in his secret base he is frequently seen playing chess with mallah and comparing it to the game of wits he considers himself to be playing against robin in the rare instances where he himself fights he appears to possess limited telekinetic and telepathic abilities he is otherwise defenseless and an easy target several times in the series not even able to defend against a slap on the back from beast boy as a result of his defenselessness from a physical standpoint he relies almost entirely on his evil subordinates to carry out his plans with himself providing the strategy and intelligence this reliance proves mostly justified in the episode calling all titans in this episode the brain uses a stolen teen titans communicator robin s to be precise who gave it to madame rouge thinking she was hot spot to track down and capture every honorary teen titan by sending villains to capture them in most cases the brain is able to provide exactly the evil opponent or more than one opponent needed to capture any hero the brain seems unable to adapt to any possible holes in his plan and this flaw costs him in the episode titans together as the remaining heroes infiltrate his base to free the captured heroes in a last ditch effort to escape when the tables turn he detaches the skull jar from the rest of his body simultaneously turning it into a fusion device to blow up his base so he could escape saying that sometimes the best strategy is to clear the field
