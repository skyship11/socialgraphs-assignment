discussed the character in a 2007 interview when i did green arrow i went with onomatopoeia for a villain just because i loved that word and it kind of formed the character inasmuch as he would say sounds out loud it only kind of works i think on a comic book page because if you have a gun going off they usually write blam and then you can have you know the character saying blam in a word balloon but like if you tried to do that cinematically you can t really rock it a gun in a film sounds completely different it doesn t read as blam and so to have a dude say blam i think it works great in print and on a comic book page i don t think that character would translate very well outside of that 2 fictional character biography edit onomatopoeia first appears where he murders a female crimefighter named virago after telling her his name the interlude in which this occurs serves as a lead in to the sounds of violence a three issue storyline that runs through issues 13 15 of the

one arrow in between the first and middle knuckles of his right hand one through his right foot and one through the palm of his right hand none of which slows him down or even impairs his manual dexterity in the same issue he even catches one of the green arrow s arrows in midair using only his teeth after being shot he jumps off the roof of the star city hospital falling seven stories and
