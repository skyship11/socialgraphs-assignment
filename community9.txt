for superboy much to draper s resentment 78 as an adult draper underwent a self imposed self improvement regimen including exercise and cosmetic surgery to overcome his physical shortcomings he became an expert locksmith and architect designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called mount olympus impressed by the achievement superman augmented the prison s security by placing it on an antigravity platform initially dubbed draper s island by superman it was informally renamed superman island by the adult lana with whom draper remained smitten just as she remained lovestruck by superman it was the latter name plus the novelty of the floating platform that caught public attention diverting recognition from draper himself this proved the final straw for draper who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the master jailer 79 he attacked superman and kidnapped lana under that name superman defeated him and he was sent to his own prison 80 in the new adventures of superboy 17 may 1981 at the prodding of carl superboy creates a robot named kator as a sparring adversary and gives the safety cutoff switch to jonathan kent kator however developed an artificial intelligence and almost killed the boy of steel before being destroyed in the new adventures of superboy 18 the robot apparently gave draper its identity and powers before being destroyed draper as the new kator then engages superboy in combat but jonathan kent presses the safety switch on the cutoff device which removes kator s superpowers from draper and superboy removes the memory of draper ever being kator 81 82 in the post crisis comics carl draper first appeared in the adventures of superman 517 november 1994 this was during the dead again storyline when superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb from the death of superman storyline draper was hired by s t a r labs to design a holding cell for conduit when his daughter carla asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even superman draper initially designed a trap that only the real superman could escape from explaining this to superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named deathtrap when superman escaped the trap draper became obsessed with proving that he could capture the real thing note this version of draper was dressed in casual wear only getting an updated costume with chain based attacks later draper made several other attempts to capture superman often programming the deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere on one occasion in superman the man of steel 43 april 1995 he programmed deathtrap to appear during a draper security press conference and display how draper s devices were being subverted thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company in action comics 739 superman in his blue energy form was captured in an energy hobble by deathtrap now calling himself the locksmith at the end of the story it was revealed to the reader that his daughter carla draper was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this the now costumed master jailer

χ and ψ were among several variants of the same letter used originally for kʰ and later in western areas such as arcadia as a simplification of the digraph χς for ks in the end more conservative eastern forms became the standard of classical greek and thus χ chi stood for kʰ later x palatalized to ç in modern greek before front vowels however the etruscans had taken over χ from western greek and it therefore stands for ks in etruscan and latin the letter χ ψ for kʰ was a greek addition to the alphabet placed after the semitic letters along with phi φ for pʰ pronunciation and use

7 8 9 zeus is the child of cronus and rhea the youngest of his siblings to be born though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from cronus s stomach in most traditions he is married to hera by whom he is usually said to have fathered ares eileithyia hebe and hephaestus 10 11 at the oracle of dodona his consort was said to be dione 12 by whom the iliad states that he fathered aphrodite 15 according to the theogony zeus first wife was metis by whom he had athena 16 zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades these resulted in many divine and heroic offspring including apollo artemis hermes persephone dionysus perseus heracles helen of troy minos and the muses 10 he was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods 17 and assigned roles to the others 18 even the gods who are not his natural children address him as father and all the gods rise in his presence 19 20 he was equated with many foreign weather gods permitting pausanias to observe that

the name ζάς 23 zeus is the greek continuation of di ēus the name of the proto indo european god of the daytime sky also called dyeus ph2tēr sky father 24 25 the god is known under this name in the rigveda vedic sanskrit dyaus dyaus pita latin compare jupiter from iuppiter deriving from the proto indo european vocative dyeu ph2tēr 26 deriving from the root dyeu to shine and in its many derivatives sky heaven god 24 albanian zoj z is also a cognate of zeus in both the greek and albanian forms the original cluster di underwent affrication to dz 9 zeus is the only deity in the olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent indo european etymology 27 the earliest attested forms of the name are the mycenaean greek 𐀇𐀸 di we and 𐀇𐀺 di wo written in the linear b syllabic script 28 plato in his cratylus gives a folk etymology of zeus meaning cause of life always to all things because of puns between alternate titles of zeus zen and dia with the greek words for life and because of 29 this etymology along with plato s entire method of deriving etymologies is not supported by modern scholarship 30 31 diodorus siculus wrote that zeus was also called zen because the humans believed that he was the cause of life zen 32 while lactantius wrote that he was called zeus and zen not because he is the giver of life but because he was the first who lived of the children of cronus 33 mythology birth cave of zeus mount ida crete in hesiod s theogony c 730 700 bc cronus after castrating his father uranus 34 becomes the supreme ruler of the cosmos and weds his sister rhea by whom he begets three daughters and three sons hestia demeter hera hades poseidon and lastly wise zeus the youngest of the six 35 he swallows each child as soon as they are born having received a prophecy from his parents gaia and uranus that one of his own children is destined to one day overthrow him as he overthrew his father 36 this causes rhea unceasing grief 37 and upon becoming pregnant with her sixth child zeus she approaches her parents gaia and uranus seeking a plan to save her child and bring retribution to cronus 38 following her parents instructions she travels to lyctus in crete where she gives birth to zeus 39 handing the newborn child over to gaia for her to raise and gaia takes him to a cave on mount aegaeon 40 rhea then gives to cronus in the place of a child a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he promptly swallows unaware that it isn t his son 41 while hesiod gives lyctus as zeus s birthplace he is the only source to do so 42 and other authors give different locations the poet eumelos of corinth 8th century bc according to john the lydian considered zeus to have been born in lydia 43 while the alexandrian poet callimachus c 310 c 240 bc in his hymn to zeus says that he was born in arcadia 44 diodorus siculus fl 1st century bc seems at one point to give mount ida as his birthplace but later states he is born in dicte 45 and the mythographer apollodorus first or second century ad similarly says he was born in a cave in dicte 46 infancy while the theogony says nothing of zeus s upbringing other than that he grew up swiftly 47 other sources provide more detailed accounts according to apollodorus rhea after giving birth to zeus in a cave in dicte gives him to the nymphs adrasteia and ida daughters of melisseus to nurse 48 they feed him on the milk of the she goat amalthea 49 while the kouretes guard the cave and beat their spears on their shields so that cronus cannot hear the infant s crying 50 diodorus siculus provides a similar account saying that after giving birth rhea travels to mount ida and gives the newborn zeus to the kouretes 51 who then takes him to some nymphs not named who raised him on a mixture of honey and milk from the goat amalthea 52 he also refers to the kouretes rais ing a great alarum and in doing so deceiving cronus 53 and relates that when the kouretes were carrying the newborn zeus that the umbilical cord fell away at the river triton 54 hyginus in his fabulae relates a version in which cronus casts poseidon into the sea and hades to the underworld instead of swallowing them when zeus is born hera also not swallowed asks rhea to give her the young zeus and rhea gives cronus a stone to swallow 55 hera gives him to amalthea who hangs his cradle from a tree where he isn t in heaven on earth or in the sea meaning that when cronus later goes looking for zeus he is unable to find him 56 hyginus also says that ida althaea and adrasteia usually considered the children of oceanus are sometimes called the daughters of melisseus and the nurses of zeus 57 according to a fragment of epimenides the nymphs helike and kynosura are the young zeus s nurses cronus travels to crete to look for zeus who to conceal his presence transforms himself into a snake and his two nurses into bears 58 according to musaeus after zeus is born rhea gives him to themis themis in turn gives him to amalthea who owns a she goat which nurses the young zeus 59 antoninus liberalis in his metamorphoses says that rhea gives birth to zeus in a sacred cave in crete full of sacred bees which become the nurses of the infant while the cave is considered forbidden ground for both mortals and gods a group of thieves seek to steal honey from it upon laying eyes on the swaddling clothes of zeus their bronze armour split s away from their bodies and zeus would have killed them had it not been for the intervention of the moirai and themis he instead transforms them into various species of birds 60 ascension to power 1st century bc statue of zeus 61 according to the theogony after zeus reaches manhood cronus is made to disgorge the five children and the stone by the stratagems of gaia but also by the skills and strength of zeus presumably in reverse order vomiting out the stone first then each of the five children in the opposite order to swallowing 62 zeus then sets up the stone at delphi so that it may act as a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men 63 zeus next frees the cyclopes who in return and out of gratitude give him his thunderbolt which had previously been hidden by gaia 64 then begins the titanomachy the war between the olympians led by zeus and the titans led by cronus for control of the universe with zeus and the olympians fighting from mount olympus and the titans fighting from mount othrys 65 the battle lasts for ten years with no clear victor emerging until upon gaia s advice zeus releases the hundred handers who similarly to the cyclopes were imprisoned beneath the earth s surface 66 he gives them nectar and ambrosia and revives their spirits 67 and they agree to aid him in the war 68 zeus then launches his final attack on the titans hurling bolts of lightning upon them while the hundred handers attack with barrages of rocks and the titans are finally defeated with zeus banishing them to tartarus and assigning the hundred handers the task of acting as their warders 69 apollodorus provides a similar account saying that when zeus reaches adulthood he enlists the help of the oceanid metis who gives cronus an emetic forcing to him to disgorge the stone and zeus s five siblings 70 zeus then fights a similar ten year war against the titans until upon the prophesying of gaia he releases the cyclopes and hundred handers from tartarus first slaying their warder campe 71 the cyclopes give him his thunderbolt poseidon his trident and hades his helmet of invisibility and the titans are defeated and the hundred handers made their guards 72 according to the iliad after the battle with the titans zeus shares the world with his brothers poseidon and hades by drawing lots zeus receives the sky poseidon the sea and hades the underworld with the earth and olympus remaining common ground 73 challenges to power zeus centre left battles against porphyrion far right detail of the gigantomachy frieze from the pergamon altar pergamon museum berlin upon assuming his place as king of the cosmos zeus rule is quickly challenged the first of these challenges to his power comes from the giants who fight the olympian gods in a battle known as the gigantomachy according to hesiod the giants are the offspring of gaia born from the drops of blood that fell on the ground when cronus castrated his father uranus 74 there is however no mention of a battle between the gods and the giants in the theogony 75 it is apollodorus who provides the most complete account of the gigantomachy he says that gaia out of anger at how zeus had imprisoned her children the titans bore the giants to uranus 76 there comes to the gods a prophecy that the giants cannot be defeated by the gods on their own but can be defeated only with the help of a mortal gaia upon hearing of this seeks a special pharmakon herb that will prevent the giants from being killed zeus however orders eos dawn selene moon and helios sun to stop shining and harvests all of the herb himself before having athena summon heracles 77 in the conflict porphyrion one of the most powerful of the giants launches an attack upon heracles and hera zeus however causes porphyrion to become lustful for hera and when he is just about to violate her zeus strikes him with his thunderbolt before heracles deals the fatal blow with an arrow 78 in the theogony after zeus defeats the titans and banishes them to tartarus his rule is challenged by the monster typhon a giant serpentine creature who battles zeus for control of the cosmos according to hesiod typhon is the offspring of gaia and tartarus 79 described as having a hundred snaky fire breathing heads 80 hesiod says he would have come to reign over mortals and immortals had it not been for zeus noticing the monster and dispatching with him quickly 81 the two of them meet in a cataclysmic battle before zeus defeats him easily with his thunderbolt and the creature is hurled down to tartarus 82 epimenides presents a different version in which typhon makes his way into zeus s palace while he is sleeping only for zeus to wake and kill the monster with a thunderbolt 83 aeschylus and pindar give somewhat similar accounts to hesiod in that zeus overcomes typhon with relative ease defeating him with his thunderbolt 84 apollodorus in contrast provides a more complex narrative 85 typhon is similarly to in hesiod the child of gaia and tartarus produced out of anger at zeus s defeat of the giants 86 the monster attacks heaven and all of the gods out of fear transform into animals and flee to egypt except for zeus who attacks the monster with his thunderbolt and sickle 87 typhon is wounded and retreats to mount kasios in syria where zeus grapples with him giving the monster a chance to wrap him in his coils and rip out the sinews from his hands and feet 88 disabled zeus is taken by typhon to the corycian cave in cilicia where he is guarded by the she dragon delphyne 89 hermes and aegipan however steal back zeus s sinews and refit them reviving him and allowing him to return to the battle pursuing typhon who flees to mount nysa there typhon is given ephemeral fruits by the moirai which reduce his strength 90 the monster then flees to thrace where he hurls mountains at zeus which are sent back at him by the god s thunderbolts before while fleeing to sicily zeus launches mount etna upon him finally ending him 91 nonnus who gives the most longest and most detailed account from antiquity presents a narrative similar to apollodorus with differences such as that it is instead cadmus and pan who recovers zeus s sinews by luring typhon with music and then tricking him 92 in the iliad homer tells of another attempted overthrow in which hera poseidon and athena conspire to overpower zeus and tie him in bonds it is only because of the nereid thetis who summons briareus one of the hecatoncheires to olympus that the other olympians abandon their plans out of fear for briareus 93 seven wives of zeus jupiter disguised as a shepherd tempts mnemosyne by jacob de wit 1727 according to hesiod zeus had seven wives his first wife was the oceanid metis whom he swallowed on the advice of gaia and uranus so that no son of his by metis would overthrow him as had been foretold later their daughter athena would be born from the forehead of zeus 16 zeus s next marriage was to his aunt and advisor themis who bore the horae seasons and the moirai fates 94 zeus then married the oceanid eurynome who bore the three charites graces 95 zeus s fourth wife was his sister demeter who bore persephone 96 the fifth wife of zeus was his aunt the titan mnemosyne whom he seduced in the form of a mortal shepherd zeus and mnemosyne had the nine muses 97 his sixth wife was the titan leto who gave birth to apollo and artemis on the island of delos 98 zeus s seventh and final wife was his older sister hera 99 children of zeus and his seven wives 100 zeus metis 101 athena 102 themis

brother and consort of hera according to pausanias zeus had turned himself into a cuckoo to woo hera 105 by hera zeus sired ares hebe eileithyia and hephaestus 11 though some accounts say that hera produced these offspring alone some also include eris 106 enyo 107 and angelos 108 as their daughters in the section of the iliad known to scholars as the deception of zeus the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it 109 according to a scholion on theocritus idylls when hera was heading toward mount thornax alone zeus created a terrible storm and transformed himself into a cuckoo bird who flew down and sat on her lap when hera saw the cuckoo she felt pity for him and covered him with her cloak zeus then transformed back and took hold of her because she was refusing to sleep with him due to their mother he promised to marry her 110 in one account hera refused to marry zeus and hid in a cave to avoid him an earthborn man named achilles convinced her to give him a chance and thus the two had their first sexual intercourse zeus then promised achilles that every person who bore his name shall become famous 111 a variation goes that hera had been reared by a nymph named macris on the island of euboea but zeus stole her away where mt cithaeron in the words of plutarch afforded them a shady recess when macris came to look for her ward the mountain god cithaeron drove her away saying that zeus was taking his pleasure there with leto 112 according to callimachus their wedding feast lasted three thousand years 113 the apples of the hesperides that heracles was tasked by eurystheus to take were a wedding gift by gaia to the couple 114 zeus mated with several nymphs and was seen as the father of many mythical mortal progenitors of hellenic dynasties aside from his seven wives relationships with immortals included dione and maia 115 116 among mortals were semele io europa and leda for more details see below and with the young ganymede although he was mortal zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality zeus carrying away ganymede late archaic terracotta 480 470 bc many myths render hera as jealous of his affairs and a consistent enemy of zeus mistresses and their children by him for a time a nymph named echo had the job of distracting hera from his affairs by talking incessantly and when hera discovered the deception she cursed echo to repeat the words of others 117 according to diodorus siculus alcmene the mother of heracles was the very last mortal woman zeus ever slept with following the birth of heracles he ceased to beget humans altogether and fathered no more children 118 prometheus and conflicts with humans when the gods met at mecone to discuss which portions they will receive after a sacrifice the titan prometheus decided to trick zeus so that humans receive the better portions he sacrificed a large ox and divided it into two piles in one pile he put all the meat and most of the fat covering it with the ox s grotesque stomach while in the other pile he dressed up the bones with fat prometheus then invited zeus to choose zeus chose the pile of bones this set a precedent for sacrifices where humans will keep the fat for themselves and burn the bones for the gods zeus enraged at prometheus s deception prohibited the use of fire by humans prometheus however stole fire from olympus in a fennel stalk and gave it to humans this further enraged zeus who punished prometheus by binding him to a cliff where an eagle constantly ate prometheus s liver which regenerated every night prometheus was eventually freed from his misery by heracles 119 now zeus angry at humans decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given he commands hephaestus to mold from earth the first woman a beautiful evil whose descendants would torment the human race after hephaestus does so several other gods contribute to her

major center where all greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was olympia their quadrennial festival featured the famous games there was also an altar to zeus made not of stone but of ash from the accumulated remains of many centuries worth of animals sacrificed there outside of the major inter polis sanctuaries there were no modes of worshipping zeus precisely shared across the greek world most of the titles listed below for instance could be found at any number of greek temples from asia minor to sicily certain modes of ritual were held in common as well sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar for instance zeus velchanos with one exception greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of zeus as crete minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient greek religion by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new will durant observed 289 and cretan zeus retained his youthful minoan features the local child of the great mother a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort 290 whose minoan name the greeks hellenized as velchanos was in time assumed as an epithet by zeus as transpired at many other sites and he came to be venerated in crete as zeus velchanos boy zeus often simply the kouros in crete zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at knossos ida and palaikastro in the hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to zeus velchanos was founded at the hagia triada site of a long ruined minoan palace broadly contemporary coins from phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped a youth sits among the branches of a tree with a cockerel on his knees 291 on other cretan coins velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage 292 inscriptions at gortyn and lyttos record a velchania festival showing that velchanios was still widely venerated in hellenistic crete 293 the stories of minos and epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings and priests the dramatic setting of plato s laws is along the pilgrimage route to one such site emphasizing archaic cretan knowledge on crete zeus was represented in art as a long haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ho megas kouros the great youth ivory statuettes of the divine boy were unearthed near the labyrinth at knossos by sir arthur evans 294 with the kouretes a band of ecstatic armed dancers he presided over the rigorous military athletic training and secret rites of the cretan paideia the myth of the death of cretan zeus localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source callimachus 295 together with the assertion of antoninus liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees suggests that velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit 296 the hellenistic writer euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that zeus had actually been a great king of crete and that posthumously his glory had slowly turned him into a deity the works of euhemerus himself have not survived but christian patristic writers took up the suggestion zeus lykaios further information lykaia laurel wreathed head of zeus on a gold stater lampsacus c 360 340 bc cabinet des médailles the epithet zeus lykaios λύκαιος wolf zeus is assumed by zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the lykaia on the slopes of mount lykaion wolf mountain the tallest peak in rustic arcadia zeus had only a formal connection 297 with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants 298 near the ancient ash heap where the sacrifices took place 299 was a forbidden precinct in which allegedly no shadows were ever cast 300 according to plato 301 a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to zeus lykaios and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal s whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine year cycle had ended there were games associated with the lykaia removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of arcadia megalopolis there the major temple was dedicated to zeus lykaios there is however the crucial detail that lykaios or lykeios epithets of zeus and apollo may derive from proto greek λύκη light a noun still attested in compounds such as ἀμφιλύκη twilight λυκάβας year lit light s course etc this cook argues brings indeed much new light to the matter as achaeus the contemporary tragedian of sophocles spoke of zeus lykaios as starry eyed and this zeus lykaios may just be the arcadian zeus son of aether described by cicero again under this new signification may be seen pausanias descriptions of lykosoura being the first city that ever the sun beheld and of the altar of zeus at the summit of mount lykaion before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and facing the sun rise further cook sees only the tale of zeus sacred precinct at mount lykaion allowing no shadows referring to zeus as god of light lykaios 302 a statue of zeus in a drawing additional cults of zeus

deities like persephone and demeter and also the heroes at their tombs olympian gods by contrast usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars in some cases cities were not entirely sure whether the daimon to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground zeus thus the shrine at lebadaea in boeotia might belong to the hero trophonius or to zeus trephonius the nurturing depending on whether you believe pausanias or strabo the hero amphiaraus was honored as zeus amphiaraus at oropus outside of thebes and the spartans even had a shrine to zeus agamemnon ancient molossian kings sacrificed to zeus areius αρειος strabo mention that at tralles there was the zeus larisaeus λαρισαιος 303 in ithome they honored the zeus ithomatas they had a sanctuary and a statue

hundred and φονεύω to kill it was a custom of messenians at which they offered sacrifice to zeus when any of them had killed a hundred enemies aristomenes have offered three times this sacrifice at

him and a local festival called the aetnaea in his honor 309 other examples are listed below as zeus aeneius or zeus aenesius αινησιος he was worshiped in the island of cephalonia where he had a temple on mount aenos 310 oracles of zeus although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to apollo the heroes or various goddesses like themis a few oracular sites were dedicated to zeus in addition some foreign oracles such as baʿal s at heliopolis were associated with zeus in greek or jupiter in latin the oracle at dodona the cult of zeus at dodona in epirus where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium bc onward centered on a sacred oak when the odyssey was composed circa 750 bc divination was done there by barefoot priests called selloi who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches 311 by the time herodotus wrote about dodona female priestesses called peleiades doves had replaced the male priests zeus consort at dodona was not hera but the goddess dione whose name is a feminine form of zeus her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre hellenic deity and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle the oracle at siwa the oracle of ammon at the siwa oasis in the western desert of egypt did not lie within the bounds of the greek world before alexander s day but it already loomed large in the greek mind during the archaic era herodotus mentions consultations with zeus ammon in his account of the persian war zeus ammon was especially favored at sparta where a temple to him existed by the time of the peloponnesian war 312 after alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at siwa the figure arose in the hellenistic imagination of a libyan sibyl zeus

century greco buddhist art 313 zeus was identified with the roman god jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination see interpretatio graeca with various other deities such as the egyptian ammon and the etruscan tinia he along with dionysus absorbed the role of the chief phrygian god sabazios in the syncretic deity known in rome as sabazius the seleucid ruler antiochus iv epiphanes erected a statue of zeus olympios in the judean temple in jerusalem 314 hellenizing jews referred to this statue as baal shamen in english lord of heaven 315 zeus is also identified with the hindu deity indra not only they are the king of gods but their weapon thunder is similar 316 zeus and the sun zeus is occasionally conflated with the hellenic sun god helios who is sometimes either directly referred to as zeus eye 317 or clearly implied as such hesiod for instance describes zeus eye as effectively the sun 318 this perception is possibly derived from earlier proto indo european religion in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of dyḗus pḥatḗr see hvare khshaeta 319 euripides in his now lost tragedy mysians described zeus as sun eyed and helios is said elsewhere to be the brilliant eye of zeus giver of life 320 in another of euripides tragedies medea the chorus refers to helios as light born from zeus 321 although the connection of helios to zeus does not seem to have basis in early greek cult and writings nevertheless there are many examples of direct identification in later times 322 the hellenistic period gave birth to serapis a greco egyptian deity conceived as a chthonic avatar of zeus whose solar nature is indicated by the sun crown and rays the greeks depicted him with 323 frequent joint dedications to zeus serapis helios have been found all over the mediterranean 323 for example the anastasy papyrus now housed in the british museum equates helios to not just zeus and serapis but also mithras 324 and a series of inscriptions from trachonitis give evidence of the cult of zeus the unconquered sun 325 there is evidence of zeus being worshipped as a solar god in the aegean island of amorgos based on a lacunose inscription ζεὺς ἥλ ιο ς zeus the sun meaning sun elements of zeus worship could be as early as the fifth century bc 326 the cretan zeus tallaios had solar elements to his cult talos was the local equivalent of helios

1502 divine retribution is a major theme in the hellenic world view providing the unifying theme of the tragedies of sophocles and many other literary works 5 hesiod states also deadly nyx bore nemesis an affliction to mortals subject to death theogony 223 though perhaps an interpolated line nemesis appears in a still more concrete form in a fragment of the epic cypria she is implacable justice that of zeus in the olympian scheme of things although it is clear she existed prior to him as her images look similar to several other goddesses such as cybele rhea demeter and artemis 6 as the goddess of rhamnous nemesis was honored and placated in an archaic sanctuary in the isolated district of rhamnous in northeastern attica there she was a daughter of oceanus the primeval river ocean that encircles the world pausanias noted her iconic statue there it included a crown of stags and little nikes and was made by pheidias after the battle of marathon 490 bc crafted from a block of parian marble brought by the overconfident persians who had intended to make a memorial stele after their expected victory 7 her cult may have originated at smyrna she is portrayed as a winged goddess wielding a whip or a dagger the poet mesomedes wrote a hymn to nemesis in the early second century ad where he addressed her nemesis winged balancer of life dark faced goddess daughter of justice and mentioned her adamantine bridles that restrain the frivolous insolences of mortals in early times the representations of nemesis resembled aphrodite who sometimes bears the epithet nemesis

and as such is akin to atë and the erinyes she was sometimes called adrasteia probably meaning one from whom there is no escape her epithet erinys implacable is specially applied to demeter and the phrygian mother goddess cybele family edit nemesis has been described as the daughter of oceanus erebus or zeus 8 but according to hyginus she was a child of erebus and nyx she has also been described by hesiod as the daughter of nyx alone in the theogony nemesis is the sister of the moirai the fates the keres black fates the oneiroi dreams eris discord and apate deception some made her the daughter of zeus by an unnamed mother 9 in several traditions nemesis was seen as the mother of helen of troy by zeus adopted and raised by leda and tyndareus 10 one source of the myth says that nemesis was the mother of the telchines by tartaros who others say were children of pontus and gaea or thalassa bacchylides fragment 52 from tzetzes on theogony trans campbell vol greek lyric iv greek

nemesis and zeus edit in some traditions nemesis is the mother of helen of troy rather than the mortal queen leda this narrative is first found in the lost epic cypria the prelude of the iliad according to its author stasinus of cyprus helen was born from the rape of nemesis by zeus zeus fell in love with nemesis here presented as his daughter and pursued her only for her to flee in shame she took several forms to escape zeus but he eventually captured her 9 pseudo apollodorus speaks of a single transformation into a goose while zeus turned into a swan to hunt her down and raped her producing an egg that was given to the queen of sparta helen hatched from the egg and was raised by leda 11 12 in another variation zeus desired nemesis but could not persuade her to sleep with him so he tasked aphrodite to transform into an eagle and mock chase him while he transformed into a swan nemesis pitying the poor swan offered it refuge in her arms and fell into a deep sleep while asleep zeus raped her and in time she bore an egg which was transported to leda by hermes 13 according to eratosthenes in his catasterismi this version was presented by cratinus 14 narcissus edit nemesis enacted divine retribution on narcissus for his vanity after he rejected the advances of the nymph echo nemesis lured him to a pool where he caught sight of his own reflection and fell in love with it eventually dying 15 aura edit in nonnus epic dionysiaca aura one of artemis virgin attendants questioned her mistress virginity due to the feminine and curvaceous shape of her body aura claimed that no goddess or woman with that sort of figure would be a virgin and asserted her own superiority over the goddess thanks to her own lean and boyish silhouette artemis enraged went to nemesis and asked for revenge nemesis promised to the goddess that aura would have her punishment and that the punishment would be to lose the virginity she took such pride in nemesis then contacted eros the god of love and he struck dionysus with one of his arrows dionysus fell madly in love with aura and when she rebuffed his advances he got her drunk tied her up and raped her as she lay unconscious bringing nemesis plan to a success 16 local cult edit a festival called nemeseia by some identified with the genesia was held at athens its object was to avert the nemesis of the dead who were supposed to have the power of punishing the living if their cult had been in any way neglected sophocles electra 792 e rohde psyche 1907 i 236 note i smyrna edit nemesis on a brass sestertius of hadrian struck at rome ad 136 at smyrna there were two manifestations of nemesis more akin to aphrodite than to artemis the reason for this duality is hard to explain it is suggested that they represent two aspects of the goddess the kindly and the implacable or the goddesses of the old city and the new city refounded by alexander the martyrology acts of pionius set in the decian persecution of ad 250 51 mentions a lapsed smyrnan christian who was attending to the sacrifices at the altar of the temple of these nemeses rome edit nemesis was one of several tutelary deities of the drill ground as nemesis campestris modern scholarship offers little support for the once prevalent notion that arena personnel such as gladiators venatores and bestiarii were personally or professionally dedicated to her cult rather she seems to have represented a kind of imperial fortuna who dispensed imperial retribution on the one hand and imperially subsidized gifts on the other both were functions of the popular gladiatorial ludi held in roman arenas 17 she is shown on a few examples of imperial coinage as nemesis pax mainly under claudius and hadrian in the third century ad there is evidence of the belief in an all

biography edit bekka is the daughter of himon one of the new gods whose achievements include invention of the sentient mother box computers and discovery of the x element that fueled his co creation of the teleporting boom tubes alongside fellow scientist metron for many years bekka lived with her father in secret on apokolips as himon organized an underground uprising against darkseid s tyrannical rule hunted for his role in this planned insurgence himon took extra care to shield bekka from darkseid s notice himon never imagined that bekka would fall in love with orion darkseid s own son when he stumbled into their lives after healing the wounded dog of war himon and bekka aided orion in freeing his mother tigra from imprisonment for this act himon was seemingly slain by darkseid bekka accompanies orion and tigra to new genesis where her love continues to soothe the savagery that lurks within the dog of war in the storyline torment in superman batman 37 42 august 2007 january 2008 bekka and batman help superman escape from a fictional planet called tartaros where superman is being held prisoner by desaad during the rescue mission she and batman fall in love and her affection causes batman to reflect on the lack of love he has forced himself to endure bekka likens her spell of desire to a siren s call but says that it affects her as well in the end she leaves with orion when he comes to get her in her home while thinking that staying with orion she will forget batman some unknown person approaches her and she is then apparently killed as part of death of the new gods in death of the new gods it is initially revealed that her killer and the killer of all the new gods is none other than her father himon however the killer is later shown to actually be the infinity man disguised as himon 1 the new 52 edit in september 2011 dc comics rebooted the continuity of its books in an initiative called the new 52 in this new timeline bekka was born a daughter of genesisian scientist himon and she held a subconscious power over the emotional attraction in others one so powerful that not only would people uncontrollably fight over her affections or follow her lead to a fault men and women alike could and would do anything she asked of them inadvertently making her life rather harsh eventually this charm drew the attentions of izaya current and longstanding leader of the new gods so potent was this charm that while he was resistant to it he could see the potential it would have on the battlefield 2 a charm that would be honed refined and become more focused with age eventually growing in power and magnitude that it d enabled her to bolster her lieges armies and could potentially have wrested control of his throne if tested godhead edit bekka is presented within the cities of new genesis among a council of elite new gods under the direct command of highfather called the council of eight serving as a member of his elite warrior guard when called forth at the command of their monarch bekka communes secretly with orion regarding his approach towards recruiting the lanterns and acquisition of the life equation orion states that they would be stupid to refuse his offer but she retorts that if they refused would they force them to join the revaluation stuns the latter to silence 3 after a quick reprimand by the all hearing highfather the council is dispatched all across the prime earth universe to retrieve a ring from the various lantern sects citation needed bekka being dispatched to new korugar where the sinestro corps reside after having dispatched arkillo with lopping off some fingers and taking his ring she heads back to new genesis all while garnering the interests of their leader thaal sinestro after handing her ring in along with the others to lord izaya they head out to test this new power they ve acquired in the belief that the seven lights will yield the ultimate power he seeks but when this test fails after trying to convert a gutter slum planet into a vassal for the new gods only to create horrendous monsters in their wake her sovereign orders the council to find the white lantern who is currently in possession of what he desires and to seek out the rest of the light wielders to corral as well as contain deeming them too dangerous to be left loose bekka and her vanguard are found on the planet nok laying siege to the indigo tribe she begs their leader indigo 1 to surrender nearly winning her over using her power only then to be blasted by the oncoming sinestro corps the shock is short lived however and she her forces soon retake the advantage slaughtering dozens of fear lanterns in the ensuing battle 4 seeking to capitalize on this sinestro himself detonates his rings and corpsmen from outer orbit ordering his more trusted group to pull out while the rest are used as dirty bombs to cover theirs the gl stragglers and whats left of the nomadic lanterns of the violet light s escape enraged at the callous fear lantern masters tactics and the deaths of her allies and enemies in his service bekka swears bloody vengeance against him and his entire corps in another corner of space she can be seen floating through the debris of ruined pirate ships sent as a distraction and a form of invite to bekka by the sinestro corps leader who appears to her as a glowing yellow construct to convey a message still inflamed by his tactics taunting the fear lantern by stating how the new gods have all but captured the rest of the light users stating defeat is inevitable citation needed however sinestro only retorts by adding that all they had to do was ask and many of the corps would have willingly offered to help in their quest against darkseid but instead they went and pressured the various corps into submission causing the conflict in the first place bekka orders her men to join in the search for the remaining lanterns and to seek out the controller on the other end of the apparition speaking to her after they leave professing their love sinestro marvels at how she can coax their loyalties the way she does going onto say that he did not send those space pirates to delay her advance but to profess he liked her influential work wondering why the construct sinestro sent is still following her he goes onto say that while it would be interesting a face to face encounter is out of the question considering her odd talents when she brought the notion up although he also says if bekka wished to be rid of him she could have just as easily ported away using a boom tube by now when questioned as to why he remained if it was not to broker terms of surrender the construct elaborates that it is because he sees prime corpsmen material in her as the light form fades away revealing a qwardian power ring citation needed back on new genesis bekka stands guard with hylat as highfather preps a boom tube to earth readying to conscript its populace into his armies bekka professes he underestimates the passions of the human race seeing as how fervently the lantern corps have resisted them to a point izaya rebuffed her claims stating they were now invisible with the life equation in hand and wondered if their fears should be more concerned with more internal treachery given malhedron s turn table antics as if to quote her fears sinestro soon appeared within highfather s war council nodding in compliance with her on the will and grit of earth s people after sinestro fled the scene from highfather s thrashing she claims he is escaping only to hear her war chiefs reassurance that he is heading where the tube s passage will lead him right to earth 5 sinestro corps edit on the warpath for one who had attacked and desecrated his fellow korugarians using ater clementia black mercies sinestro found himself overpowered by the warlord mongul and his apex league leaving him at the mercy of the conqueror and warworld having sent a distress beacon to any and all able yellow lanterns bekka soon arrives into battle brandishing the colors of a fear lantern after having accepted invite into the corps by the ring given to her 6 as her rings energies are drained by the weaponized satellite bekka resorts to going hand to hand with the despotic mongul as the other fear lanterns floundered without their power proving to be on equal footing with the tyrant aided by former enemies who re charmed by her siren call among them being the apex league members as well as mongul s own assault forces but lost her advantage as mongul gained the upper hand immune to her enchantress abilities luckily she found both hers and the powers of the fear lantern corps restored sinestro showing up binding mongul and jettisoning him into deep space as a lure for an anti emotion cult called the pailing a form of good will to the apex league whose home worlds of which were razed by citation needed afterwards bekka had words with sinestro stating her disapproval of summons who noted that in spite of this bekka came anyway of her own accord as the corps assembled bekka laid witness as they took claim of warworld for their own 7 after it was disclosed that there was a traitor within the sinestro corps bekka along with a host of other ring wielders were put onto high alert as lyssa drak retells the various life s stories of members of the corps present bekka snaps angrily at her and sinestro for invading her privacy only to learn that once a ring finds its host everything about the new wielder of fear becomes known to her as the lore keeper of parallax and the sinestro corps 2 on the way to monitoring new korugar s unstable core sinestro was informed that his daughter was scheming behind his back 8 after a short altercation ending with her introduction into sinestro s faction of lanterns bekka is present along with the entire roster of fear lanterns as soranik natu s initiation after a while the new god confronted him again on the matter of how and why he initiated her into corps accusing him of garnering weapons in an upcoming war citation needed sinestro proclaims while bekka believes both she and warworld are but weapons in his arsenal he proclaims neither are really a source of power for him 9 a trait he intends to show her just as the planet begins to fall apart around them the irate goddess thinking to herself she could easily kill him and pretend her involvement with the guy never happened she followed him to the planets core where he showcased the power he boasted of before in the fear entity parallax using its power bekka saw first hand how sinestro forfeited his ultimate asset to stabilize his new homeworld s core leaving him vulnerable for the very first time in decades he showcases it to her as his token of reassurance giving her an ultimate weapon a secret to keep to herself or share at her leisure citation needed powers and abilities edit pre and post crisis edit like all the new gods bekka has superior strength speed endurance immortality and is nigh impervious to physical afflictions including the immunity to diseases she is also a gifted scientist just like her father having memorized how to utilize and create her own mother box s as well as invent a host of other new genesis devices like a phase shifter device built into her suit which allows her to become invisible and intangible as well as cloak the presence of others around her also she is a skilled warrior and adept at hand to hand combat able to utilize both new genesisian and apokoliptian weaponry 10 her god power being a goddess of love of sorts revolves around emotional manipulation and compulsion able to draw out and amplify resting or repressed feelings in individual beings around her and move them to act on it as was the case with orion and batman two largely emotionally repressed beings who denied themselves the embrace of love or compassion in any of its forms the only way to break the spell of her attractive compulsion is to consummate it in physical union 11 she also possesses some kind of force projection that knocked over a horde of parademons or badly concuss a mind controlled superman bekka also has a healing touch enabling her to expedite the regeneration process of the fatally wounded variety citation needed the new 52 edit in the new 52 initiative bekka s power and status as a new god remains relatively the same though she might be stronger and faster than her previous incarnation seeing as how she could battle and fend off mongul of warworld for a time 7 other than that her empathetic abilities are magnified to the point where she can move countless dozens if not thousands of people in accordance with her whims if she sees fit becoming a sort of empathetic beacon who can move and sway love and devotion directed towards her eliciting complacent obedience getting countless others following her lead without question and inadvertently makes them fight over her affections as a consequence she s also able to fly under her own power and survive in hostile environments like the void of space with ease citation needed skills and equipment edit bekka brandishes her skill as a new genesis warrior in her graceful mastery of the sword being an able combatant capable of ripping through countless green lanterns on the battlefield as well as dispatching some of their more seasoned veterans with ease she uses her twin mother box blades in combat which can project concussion beams open boom tubes and cut well through most anything their edges meet citation needed on top of all this she also wields a yellow power ring which is functionally similar to those of the green lanterns granting her flight the ability to survive in any environment and the ability to create constructs of any shape and size as with all power rings it must be regularly recharged with the aid of a power battery that is shaped like a lantern citation needed in other media edit bekka as seen in justice league gods and monsters an alternate universe version of bekka appears in the animated film justice league gods and monsters voiced by tamara taylor this version is depicted as the wife of orion with their marriage being ostensibly used as a peace treaty between their respective families and planets of new genesis and apokolips however bekka s family slaughtered orion and his family forcing her to escape using a sword equipped with a mother box that orion gifted her after arriving on earth she went on to become her universe s version of wonder woman and found the justice league before eventually returning to space to face her past this version of bekka also appears in the animated companion web series justice league gods and monsters chronicles voiced again by tamara taylor she is dispatched to save steve trevor from kobra while they were preparing their android giganta to assassinate president elect amanda waller see also edit himon bekka s father list of

osborn 1924 mammonteus a mammoth is any species of the extinct elephantid genus mammuthus one of the many genera that make up the order of trunked mammals called proboscideans the various species of mammoth were commonly equipped with long curved tusks and in northern species a covering of long hair they lived from the pliocene epoch from around 5 million years ago into the holocene at about 4 000 years ago and various species existed in africa europe asia and north america they were members of the family elephantidae which also contains the two genera of modern elephants and their ancestors mammoths are more closely related to living asian elephants than african elephants the oldest representative of mammuthus the south african mammoth m subplanifrons appeared around 5 million years ago during the early pliocene in what is now southern and eastern africa descendant species of these mammoths moved north and continued to propagate into numerous subsequent species eventually covering most of eurasia before migrating into north america around 1 5 1 3 million years ago becoming ancestral to the columbian mammoth m columbi the last species to emerge the woolly mammoth m primigenius developed about 400 000 years ago in east asia with some surviving on russia s wrangel island in the arctic ocean as well as possibly the taymyr peninsula on mainland siberia until as recently as roughly 3 700 to 4 000 years ago still extant during the construction of the great pyramid of ancient egypt contents 1 evolution 2 etymology and early observations 3 description 4 diet 5

around the tethys sea area the closest relatives of the proboscidea are the sirenians and the hyraxes the family elephantidae is known to have existed six million years ago in africa and includes the living elephants and the mammoths among many now extinct clades the mastodon is only a distant relative of the mammoths and part of the separate mammutidae family which diverged 25 million years

mammoths comparison of a woolly mammoth left and an american mastodon right since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities it is possible to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus through morphological studies mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges on their molars the primitive species had few ridges and the amount increased gradually as new species evolved and replaced the former ones at the same time the crowns of the teeth became longer and the skulls become higher from top to bottom and shorter from the back to the front over time to accommodate this 5 tooth of m africanavus one of the earliest known species of mammoth from north africa the first known members of the genus mammuthus are the african species mammuthus subplanifrons from the pliocene and mammuthus africanavus from the pleistocene the former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms mammoths entered europe around 3 million years ago the earliest known type has been named m rumanus which spread across europe and china only its molars are known which show it had 8 10 enamel ridges a population evolved 12 14 ridges and split off from and replaced the earlier type becoming m meridionalis in turn this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth m trogontherii with 18 20 ridges which evolved in east asia ca 1 8 million years ago steppe mammoth populations replaced m meridionalis in europe between 1 and 0 7 million years ago the columbian mammoth m columbi evolved from a population of m trogontherii that had entered north america over 1 million years ago 6 mammoths derived from m trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges between 800 000 and 400 000 years ago in siberia becoming the woolly mammoth m primigenius the woolly mammoth would replace the steppe mammoth in europe during the late middle pleistocene around 200 000 years ago 5 a 2011 genetic study showed that two examined specimens of the columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths this suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring it also suggested that a north american form known as m jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species 7 by the late pleistocene mammoths in continental eurasia had undergone a major transformation including a shortening and heightening of the cranium and mandible increase in molar hypsodonty index increase in plate number and thinning of dental enamel due to this change in physical appearance it became customary to group european mammoths separately into distinguishable clusters early pleistocene mammuthus meridionalis middle pleistocene mammuthus trogontherii late pleistocene mammuthus primigenius there is speculation as to what caused this variation within the three chronospecies variations in environment climate change and migration surely played roles in the evolutionary process of the mammoths take m primigenius for example woolly mammoths lived in opened grassland biomes the cool steppe tundra of the northern hemisphere was the ideal place for mammoths to thrive because of the resources it supplied with occasional warmings during the ice age climate would change the landscape and resources available to the mammoths altered accordingly 5 8 9 in february 2021 scientists reported that dna from million year old mammoth remains had become the oldest ever sequenced 10 11 etymology and early observations paleolithic painting of mammoth from the rouffignac cave the word mammoth was first used in europe during the early 17th century when referring to maimanto tusks discovered in siberia 12 john bell 13 who was on the ob river in 1722 said that mammoth tusks were well known in the area they were called mammon s horn and were often found in washed out river banks some local people claimed to have seen a living mammoth but they came out only at night and always disappeared under water when detected he bought one and presented it to hans sloan who pronounced it an elephant s tooth the folklore of some native peoples of siberia who would routinely find mammoth bones and sometimes frozen mammoth bodies in eroding river banks had various interesting explanations for these finds among the khanty people of the irtysh river basin a belief existed that the mammoth was some kind of a water spirit according to other khanty the mammoth was a creature that lived underground burrowing its tunnels as it went and would die if it accidentally came to the surface 14 the concept of the mammoth as an underground creature was known to the chinese who received some mammoth ivory from the siberian natives accordingly the creature was known in china as yǐn shǔ 隐鼠 the hidden rodent 15 thomas jefferson who famously had a keen interest in paleontology is partially responsible for transforming the word mammoth from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size the first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a large wheel of cheese the cheshire mammoth cheese given to jefferson in 1802 16 description restoration of a steppe mammoth like their modern relatives mammoths were quite large the largest known species reached heights in the region of 4 m 13 1 ft at the shoulder and weights of up to 8 tonnes 8 8 short tons while exceptionally large males may have exceeded 12 tonnes 13 2 short tons however most species of mammoth were only about as large as a modern asian elephant which are about 2 5 m to 3 m high at the shoulder and rarely exceeding 5 tonnes both sexes bore tusks a first small set appeared at about the age of six months and these were replaced at about 18 months by the permanent set growth of the permanent set was at a rate of about 2 5 to 15 2 cm 1 to 6 in per year 17 size of various mammoth species compared with a human based on studies of their close relatives the modern elephants mammoths probably had a gestation period of 22 months resulting in a single calf being born their social structure was probably the same as that of african and asian elephants with females living in herds headed by a matriarch whilst bulls lived solitary lives or formed loose groups after sexual maturity 18 scientists discovered and studied the remains of a mammoth calf and found that fat greatly influenced its form and enabled it to store large amounts of nutrients necessary for survival in temperatures as low as 50 c 58 f 19 the fat also allowed the mammoths to increase their muscle mass allowing the mammoths to fight against enemies and live longer 20 woolly mammoths evolved a suite of adaptations for arctic life including morphological traits such as small ears and tails to minimize heat loss a thick layer of subcutaneous fat long thick fur and numerous sebaceous glands for insulation as well as a large brown fat hump like deposit behind the neck that may have functioned as a heat source and fat reservoir during winter 21 diet depending on the species or race of mammoth the diet differed somewhat depending on location although all mammoths ate similar things for the columbian mammoth m columbi the diet was mainly grazing american columbian mammoths fed primarily on cactus leaves trees and shrubs these assumptions were based on mammoth feces and mammoth teeth mammoths like modern day elephants have hypsodont molars these features also allowed mammoths to live an expansive life because of the availability of grasses and trees 22 for the mongochen mammoth its diet consisted of herbs grasses larch and shrubs and possibly alder these inferences were made through the observation of mammoth feces which scientists observed contained non arboreal pollen and moss spores 23 european mammoths had a major diet of c3 carbon fixation plants this was determined by examining the isotopic data from the european mammoth teeth 24 the arctic tundra and steppe where the mammoths lived appears to have been dominated by forbs not grass these were richer in protein and easier to digest than grasses and wooden plants which came to dominate the areas when the climate became wetter and warmer this could have been a major contributor to why the arctic megafauna went extinct 25 26 27 the yamal baby mammoth lyuba found in 2007 in the yamal peninsula in western siberia suggests that baby mammoths as do modern baby elephants ate the dung of adult animals the evidence to show this is that the dentition teeth of the baby mammoth had not yet fully developed to chew grass furthermore there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby s mother coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation which the baby mammoth would then consume spores might have gotten into its stomach while grazing for the first few times coprophagy may be an adaptation serving to populate the infant s gut with the needed microbiome for digestion mammoths alive in the arctic during the last glacial maximum consumed mainly forbs such as artemisia graminoids were only a minor part of their diet 28 extinction lyuba a mummified woolly mammoth calf at the field museum of natural history in chicago the woolly mammoth m primigenius was the last species of the genus most populations of the woolly mammoth in north america and eurasia as well as all the columbian mammoths m columbi in north america died out around the time of the last glacial retreat as part of a mass extinction of megafauna in northern eurasia and the americas until recently the last woolly mammoths were generally assumed to have vanished from europe and southern siberia about 12 000 years ago but new findings show some were still present there about 10 000 years ago slightly later the woolly mammoths also disappeared from continental northern siberia 29 a small population survived on st paul island alaska up until 3750 bc 30 31 32 and the small 33 mammoths of wrangel island survived until about 2000 bc 34 35 recent edna research of sediments indicates mammoths survived in north central siberia at least as late as 2000 bc in continental northeast siberia until at least 5300 bc and until at least 6600 bc in north america 36 the warming trend holocene that occurred 12 000 years ago accompanied by a glacial retreat and rising sea levels has been suggested as a contributing factor forests replaced open woodlands and grasslands across the continent the available habitat would have been reduced for some megafaunal species such as the mammoth however such climate changes were nothing new numerous very similar warming episodes had occurred previously within the ice age of the last several million years without producing comparable megafaunal extinctions so climate alone is unlikely to have played a decisive role 37 38 the spread of advanced human hunters through northern eurasia and the americas around the time of the extinctions however was a new development and thus might have contributed significantly 37 38 mammuthus primigenius hebior mammoth specimen bearing tool butcher marks whether the general mammoth population died out for climatic reasons or due to overhunting by humans is controversial 39 during the transition from the late pleistocene epoch to the holocene epoch there was shrinkage of the distribution of the mammoth because progressive warming at the end of the pleistocene epoch changed the mammoth s environment the mammoth steppe was a periglacial landscape with rich herb and grass vegetation that disappeared along with the mammoth because of environmental changes in the climate mammoths had moved to isolated spots in eurasia where they disappeared completely also it is thought that late paleolithic and mesolithic human hunters might have affected the size of the last mammoth populations in europe 40 there is evidence to suggest that humans did cause the mammoth extinction although there is no definitive proof it was found that humans living south of a mammoth steppe learned to adapt themselves to the harsher climates north of the steppe where mammoths resided it was concluded that if humans could survive the harsh north climate of that particular mammoth steppe then it was possible humans could hunt and eventually extinguish mammoths everywhere another hypothesis suggests mammoths fell victim to an infectious disease a combination of climate change and hunting by humans may be a possible explanation for their extinction homo erectus is known to have consumed mammoth meat as early as 1 8 million years ago 41 though this may mean only successful scavenging rather than actual hunting later humans show greater evidence for hunting mammoths mammoth bones at a 50 000 year old site in south britain suggest that neanderthals butchered the animals 42 while various sites in eastern europe dating from 15 000 to 44 000 years old suggest humans probably homo sapiens built dwellings using mammoth bones the age of some of the earlier structures suggests that neanderthals began the practice 43 however the american institute of biological sciences notes that bones of dead elephants left on the ground and subsequently trampled by other elephants tend to bear marks resembling butchery marks which have allegedly been misinterpreted as such by archaeologists 44 in 2021 a study using ancient environmental dna concluded that the extinction of the mammoth was primarily caused by dramatic vegetation changes at the end of the last glacial maximum due to a changed climate and precipitation regime during the last glacial maximum the arctic would have had a homogeneous flora consisting of mammoth steppe associated plants supporting a unique community of grazing mammals including the mammoth increased precipitation following the end of the lgm caused caused a significant paludification of the steppe which has been linked to a general decrease in species diversity of the region s former inhabitants and not just mammoths in addition the study found mammoths to have persisted on the mainland for far longer than previously thought with their shrinking distribution roughly tracking the shrinkage of the mammoth steppe their final mainland refugium the taymyr peninsula was roughly concurrent with the wrangel population the close relationship between decreasing mammoth populations and steppe as well as the lack of a sudden decline that would be associated with the human overkill hypothesis indicates that humans and mammoths may have coexisted for millennia and thus humans may have only played a minor role in the species extinction 36 many hypotheses also seek to explain the regional extinction of mammoths in specific areas scientists have speculated that the mammoths of saint paul island alaska an isolated enclave where mammoths survived until about 8 000 years ago died out as the island shrank by 80 90 when sea levels rose eventually making it too small to support a viable population 45 similarly genome sequences of the wrangel island mammoths indicate a sharp decline in genetic diversity though the extent to which this played a role in their extinction is still unclear 46 another hypothesis said to be the cause of mammoth extinction in siberia comes from the idea that many may have drowned while traveling to the northern river many of these mammoths broke through the ice and drowned this also explains bones remains in the arctic coast and some of the new siberian islands citation needed dwarfing occurred with the pygmy mammoth on the outer channel islands of california but at an earlier period those animals were very likely killed by early paleo native americans and habitat loss caused by a rising sea level that split santa rosae into the outer channel islands 47 mammoth elephant hybrid main article mammoth cloning one proposed scientific use of this preserved genetic material is to recreate living mammoths this has long been discussed theoretically but has only recently become the subject of formal effort due to advances in molecular biology techniques and cloning of mammals 48 49 50 according to one research team a mammoth cannot be recreated but they will try to eventually grow in an artificial womb a hybrid elephant with some woolly mammoth traits 51 52 comparative genomics shows that the mammoth genome matches 99 of the elephant genome so some researchers aim to engineer an elephant with some mammoth genes that code for the external appearance and traits of a mammoth 53 the outcome would be an elephant mammoth hybrid with no more than 1 mammoth genes 53 other projects are working on gradually adding mammoth genes to

enchantress and a minor goddess in ancient greek mythology and religion 1 she is either a daughter of the titan helios and the oceanid nymph perse or the goddess hecate and aeëtes circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs through the use of these and a magic wand or staff she would transform her enemies or those who offended her into animals the best known of her legends is told in homer s odyssey when odysseus visits her island of aeaea on the way back from the trojan war and she changes most of his crew into swine he manages to persuade her to return them to human shape lives with her for a year and has sons by her including latinus and telegonus her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of picus an italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances another story tells of her falling in love with the sea god glaucus who prefers the nymph scylla to her in revenge circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a dreadful monster depictions even in classical times diverged from the detail in homer s narrative which was later to be reinterpreted morally as a cautionary story against drunkenness early philosophical questions were also raised about whether the change from being a human endowed with reason to being an unreasoning beast might not be preferable after all and the resulting debate was to have a powerful impact during the renaissance circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female in the eyes of those from a later age this behaviour made her notorious both as a magician and as a type of sexually free woman she has been frequently depicted as such in all the arts from the renaissance down to modern times western paintings established a visual iconography for the figure but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning circe that appear in ovid s metamorphoses the episodes of scylla and picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire contents 1 classical literature 1 1 family and attributes 1 2 pre odyssey 1 3 homer s odyssey 1 4 post odyssey 1 5

oceanid nymphs 2 in orphic argonautica her mother is called asterope instead 3 her brothers were aeëtes keeper of the golden fleece and father of medea and perses her sister was pasiphaë the wife of king minos and mother of the minotaur 4 other accounts make her and her niece medea the daughters of hecate the goddess of witchcraft 5 by aeëtes 6 usually said to be her brother instead she was often confused with calypso due to her shifts in behavior and personality and the association that both of them had with odysseus 7 according to greek legend circe lived on the island of aeaea although homer is vague when it comes to the island s whereabouts in his epic poem argonautica the early 3rd bc author apollonius of rhodes locates aeaea somewhere south of aethalia elba within view of the tyrrhenian shore that is the western coast of italy 8 in the same poem circe s brother aeëtes describes how circe was transferred to aeaea i noted it once after taking a ride in my father helios chariot when he was taking my sister circe to the western land and we came to the coast of the tyrrhenian mainland where she dwells to this day very far from the colchian land 9 a scholiast on apollonius rhodius claims that apollonius is following hesiod s tradition in making circe arrive in aeaea on helios chariot 10 while valerius flaccus writes that circe was borne away by winged dragons 11 roman poets associated her with the most ancient traditions of latium and made her home to be on the promontory of circeo 12 homer describes circe as a dreadful goddess with lovely hair and human speech 13 apollonius writes that she just like every other descendant of helios had flashing golden eyes that shot out rays of light 14 with the author of argonautica orphica noting that she had hair like fiery rays 15 ovid s the cure for love implies that circe might have been taught the knowledge of herbs and potions from her mother perse who seems to have had similar skills 16 pre odyssey edit circe and scylla in john william waterhouse s circe invidiosa 1892 in the argonautica apollonius relates that circe purified the argonauts for the murder of medea s brother absyrtus 17 possibly reflecting an early tradition 18 in this poem the argonauts find circe bathing in salt water the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval beasts not resembling the beasts of the wild nor yet like men in body but with a medley of limbs 19 circe invites jason medea and their crew into her mansion uttering no words they show her the still bloody sword they used to cut absyrtus down and circe immediately realizes they ve visited her to be purified of murder she purifies them by slitting the throat of a suckling pig and letting the blood drip on them afterwards medea tells circe their tale in great detail albeit omitting the part of absyrtus murder nevertheless circe is not fooled and greatly disapproves of their actions however out of pity for the girl and on account of their kinship she promises not to be an obstacle on their way and orders jason and medea to leave her island immediately 20 the sea god glaucus was in love with a beautiful maiden scylla but she spurned his affections no matter how he tried to win her heart glaucus went to circe and asked her for a magic potion to make scylla fall in love with him too but circe was smitten by glaucus herself and fell in love with him but glaucus did not love her back and turned her offer of marriage down enraged circe used her knowledge of herbs and plants to take her revenge she found the spot where scylla usually took her bath and poisoned the water when scylla went down to it to bathe dogs sprang from her thighs and she was transformed into the familiar monster from the odyssey 21 22 in another similar story picus was a latian king whom circe turned into a woodpecker 23 he was the son of saturn and a king of latium he fell in love and married a nymph canens to whom he was utterly devoted one day as he was hunting boars he came upon circe who was gathering herbs in the woods circe fell immediately in love with him but picus just like glaucus before him spurned her and declared that he would remain forever faithful to canens circe furious turned picus into a woodpecker 24 his wife canens eventually wasted away in her mourning 25 during the war between the gods and the giants one of the giants picolous fled the battle against the gods and came to aeaea circe s island he attempted to chase circe away only to be killed by helios circe s ally and father 26 from the blood of the slain giant an herb came into existence moly named thus from the battle malos and with a white coloured flower either for the white sun who had killed picolous or the terrified circe who turned white 27 28 the very plant which mortals are unable to pluck from the ground that hermes would later give to odysseus in order to defeat circe 29 homer s odyssey edit frederick s church s circe 1910 in homer s odyssey an 8th century bc sequel to his trojan war epic iliad circe is initially described as a beautiful goddess living in a palace isolated in the midst of a dense wood on her island of aeaea around her home prowl strangely docile lions and wolves she lures any who land on the island to her home with her lovely singing while weaving on an enormous loom but later drugs them so that they change shape 30 one of her homeric epithets is polypharmakos knowing many drugs or charms 31 annibale carracci s ulysses and circe c 1590 at farnese palace circe invites the hero odysseus crew to a feast of familiar food a pottage of cheese and meal sweetened with honey and laced with wine but also mixed with one of her magical potions that turns them into swine only eurylochus who suspects treachery does not go in he escapes to warn odysseus and the others who have remained with the ship before odysseus reaches circe s palace hermes the messenger god sent by the goddess of wisdom athena intercepts him and reveals how he might defeat circe in order to free his crew from their enchantment hermes provides odysseus with moly to protect him from circe s magic he also tells odysseus that he must then draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her from there as hermes foretold circe would ask odysseus to bed but hermes advises caution for the treacherous goddess could still unman him unless he has her swear by the names of the gods that she will not take any further action against him following this advice odysseus is able to free his men after they have all remained on the island for a year circe advises odysseus that he must first visit the underworld something a mortal has never yet done 32 in order to gain knowledge about how to appease the gods return home safely and recover his kingdom circe also advises him on how this might be achieved and furnishes him with the protections he will need and the means to communicate with the dead on his return she further advises him about two possible routes home warning him however that both carry great danger post odyssey edit angelica kauffman s painting of circe enticing odysseus 1786 towards the end of hesiod s theogony c 700 bc it is stated that circe bore odysseus three sons agrius otherwise unknown latinus and telegonus who ruled over the tyrsenoi that is the etruscans the telegony an epic now lost relates the later history of the last of these circe eventually informed her son who his absent father was and when he set out to find odysseus gave him a poisoned spear when telegonus arrived in ithaca odysseus was away in thesprotia fighting the brygi telegonus began to ravage the island odysseus came to defend his land with the weapon circe gave him telegonus killed his father unknowingly telegonus then brought back his father s corpse to aeaea together with penelope and odysseus son by her telemachus after burying odysseus circe made the other three immortal circe married telemachus and telegonus married penelope 33 by the advice of athena 34 according to an alternative version depicted in lycophron s 3rd century bc poem alexandra and john tzetzes scholia on it circe used magical herbs to bring odysseus back to life after he had been killed by telegonus odysseus then gave telemachus to circe s daughter cassiphone in marriage sometime later telemachus had a quarrel with his mother in law and killed her cassiphone then killed telemachus to avenge her mother s death on hearing of this odysseus died of grief dionysius of halicarnassus 1 72 5 cites xenagoras the 2nd century bc historian as claiming that odysseus and circe had three different sons rhomos anteias and ardeias who respectively founded three cities called by their names rome antium and ardea in the later 5th century ce epic dionysiaca its author nonnus mentions phaunus circe s son by the sea god poseidon 35 36 other works edit three ancient plays about circe have been lost the work of the tragedian aeschylus and of the 4th century bc comic dramatists ephippus of athens and anaxilas the first told the story of odysseus encounter with circe vase paintings from the period suggest that odysseus half transformed animal men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs fragments of anaxilas also mention the transformation and one of the characters complains of the impossibility of scratching his face now that he is a pig 37 the theme of circe turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers in his episodic work the sorrows of love first century bc parthenius of nicaea interpolated another episode into the time that odysseus was staying with circe pestered by the amorous attentions of king calchus the daunian the sorceress invited him to a drugged dinner that turned him into a pig and then shut him up in her sties he was only released when his army came searching for him on the condition that he would never set foot on her island again 38 among latin treatments virgil s aeneid relates how aeneas skirts the italian island where circe dwells and hears the cries of her many male victims who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts the roars of lions that refuse the chain the grunts of bristled boars and groans of bears and herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors ears 39 in ovid s 1st century poem metamorphoses the fourth episode covers circe s encounter with ulysses the roman name of odysseus whereas book 14 covers the stories of picus and glaucus plutarch took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators contained in his 1st century moralia is the gryllus episode in which circe allows odysseus to interview a fellow greek turned into a pig after his interlocutor informs odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human they engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue 40 ancient cult edit strabo writes that a tomb shrine of circe was attended in one of the pharmacussae islands off the coast of attica typical for hero worship 41 circe was also venerated in mount circeo in the italian peninsula which took its name after her according to ancient legend strabo says that circe had a shrine in the small town and that the people there kept a bowl they claimed belonged to odysseus 42 the promontory is occupied by ruins of a platform attributed with great probability to a temple of venus or circe 43 later literature edit circea in boccaccio s c 1365 de claris mulieribus a catalogue of famous women from a 1474 edition giovanni boccaccio provided a digest of what was known of circe during the middle ages in his de mulieribus claris famous women 1361 1362 while following the tradition that she lived in italy he comments wryly that there are now many more temptresses like her to lead men astray 44 there is a very different interpretation of the encounter with circe in john gower s long didactic poem confessio amantis 1380 ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than circe and through this means he leaves her pregnant with telegonus most of the account deals with the son s later quest for and accidental killing of his father drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery 45 the story of ulysses and circe was retold as an episode in georg rollenhagen s german verse epic froschmeuseler the frogs and mice magdeburg 1595 in this 600 page expansion of the pseudo homeric batrachomyomachia it is related at the court of the mice and takes up sections 5 8 of the first part 46 in lope de vega s miscellany la circe con otras rimas y prosas 1624 the story of her encounter with ulysses appears as a verse epic in three cantos 47 this takes its beginning from homer s account but it is then embroidered in particular circe s love for ulysses remains unrequited as circe s palace nathaniel hawthorne retold the homeric account as the third section in his collection of stories from greek mythology tanglewood tales 1853 the transformed picus continually appears in this trying to warn ulysses and then eurylochus of the danger to be found in the palace and is rewarded at the end by being given back his human shape in most accounts ulysses only demands this for his own men 48 in her survey of the transformations of circe judith yarnall comments of this figure who started out as a comparatively minor goddess of unclear origin that what we know for certain what western literature attests to is her remarkable staying power these different versions of circe s myth can be seen as mirrors sometimes clouded and sometimes clear of the fantasies and assumptions of the cultures that produced them after appearing as just one of the characters that odysseus encounters on his wandering circe herself in the twists and turns of her story through the centuries has gone through far more metamorphoses than those she inflicted on odysseus s companions 49 reasoning beasts edit giovanni battista trotti s fresco of circe returning ulysses followers to human form c 1610 one of the most enduring literary themes connected with the figure of circe was her ability to change men into animals there was much speculation concerning how this could be whether the human consciousness changed at the same time and even whether it was a change for the better the gryllus dialogue was taken up by another italian writer giovan battista gelli in his la circe 1549 this is a series of ten philosophical and moral dialogues between ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals ranging from an oyster to an elephant in which circe sometimes joins most argue against changing back only the last animal a philosopher in its former existence wants to the work was translated into english soon after in 1557 by henry iden 50 later the english poet edmund spenser also made reference to plutarch s dialogue in the section of his faerie queene 1590 based on the circe episode which appears at the end of book ii sir guyon changes back the victims of acrasia s erotic frenzy in the bower of bliss most of whom are abashed at their fall from chivalric grace but one above the rest in speciall that had an hog beene late hight grille by name repined greatly and did him miscall that had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall 51 dosso dossi s circe and her lovers in a landscape c 1525 two other italians wrote rather different works that centre on the animal within the human one was niccolò machiavelli in his unfinished long poem l asino d oro the golden ass 1516 the author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by circe s herd of beasts after spending a night of love with him she explains the characteristics of the animals in her charge the lions are the brave the bears are the violent the wolves are those forever dissatisfied and so on canto 6 in canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration a cat that has allowed its prey to escape an agitated dragon a fox constantly on the look out for traps a dog that bays the moon aesop s lion in love that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws there are also emblematic satirical portraits of various florentine personalities in the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that like the gryllus of plutarch does not want to be changed back and condemns human greed cruelty and conceit 52 the other italian author was the esoteric philosopher giordano bruno who wrote in latin his cantus circaeus the incantation of circe was the fourth work on memory and the association of ideas by him to be published in 1582 it contains a series of poetic dialogues in the first of which after a long series of incantations to the seven planets of the hermetic tradition most humans appear changed into different creatures in the scrying bowl the sorceress circe is then asked by her handmaiden moeris about the type of behaviour with which each is associated according to circe for instance fireflies are the learned wise and illustrious amidst idiots asses and obscure men question 32 in later sections different characters discuss the use of images in the imagination in order to facilitate use of the art of memory which is the real aim of the work 53 french writers were to take their lead from gelli in the following century 54 antoine jacob wrote a one act social comedy in rhyme les bestes raisonnables the reasoning beasts 1661 which allowed him to satirise contemporary manners on the isle of circe ulysses encounters an ass that was once a doctor a lion that had been a valet a female doe and a horse all of whom denounce the decadence of the times the ass sees human asses everywhere asses in the town square asses in the suburbs asses in the provinces asses proud at court asses browsing in the meadows military asses trooping asses tripping it at balls asses in the theatre stalls to drive the point home in the end it is only the horse formerly a courtesan who wants to return to her former state wilhelm schubert van ehrenberg s ulysses at the palace of circe 1667 the same theme occupies la fontaine s late fable the companions of ulysses xii 1 1690 which also echoes plutarch and gelli once transformed every animal which includes a lion a bear a wolf and a mole protests that their lot is better and refuses to be restored to human shape 55 charles dennis shifted this fable to stand at the head of his translation of la fontaine select fables 1754 but provides his own conclusion that when mortals from the path of honour stray and the strong passions over reason sway what are they then but brutes tis vice alone that constitutes th enchanting wand and magic bowl the exterior form of man they wear but are in fact both wolf and bear the transformation s in the soul 56 louis fuzelier and marc antoine legrand titled their comic opera of 1718 les animaux raisonnables it had more or less the same scenario transposed into another medium and set to music by jacques aubert circe wishing to be rid of the company of ulysses agrees to change back his companions but only the dolphin is willing the others who were formerly a corrupt judge now a wolf a financier a pig an abused wife a hen a deceived husband a bull and a flibbertigibbet a linnet find their present existence more agreeable circe by john collier 19th century the venetian gasparo gozzi was another italian who returned to gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose dialoghi dell isola di circe dialogues from circe s island published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764 in this moral work the aim of ulysses in talking to the beasts is to learn more of the human condition it includes figures from fable the fox and the crow xiii and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance far from needing the intervention of circe the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island the philosopher here is not gelli s elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness like bruno s fireflies vi the only one who wishes to change in gozzi s work is the bear a satirist who had dared to criticize circe and had been changed as a punishment ix there were two more satirical dramas in later centuries one modelled on the gryllus episode in plutarch occurs as a chapter of thomas love peacock s late novel gryll grange 1861 under the title aristophanes in london half greek comedy half elizabethan masque it is acted at the grange by the novel s characters as a christmas entertainment in it spiritualist mediums raise circe and gryllus and try to convince the latter of the superiority of modern times which he rejects as intellectually and materially regressive 57 an italian work drawing on the transformation theme was the comedy by ettore romagnoli la figlia del sole the daughter of the sun 1919 hercules arrives on the island of circe with his servant cercopo and has to be rescued by the latter when he too is changed into a pig but since the naturally innocent other animals had become corrupted by imitating human vices the others who had been changed were refused when they begged to be rescued also in england austin dobson engaged more seriously with homer s account of the transformation of odysseus companions when though head face and members bristle into swine still cursed with sense their mind remains alone 58 dobson s the prayer of the swine to circe 59 1640 depicts the horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human consciousness unchanged there appears to be no relief for only in the final line is it revealed that odysseus has arrived to free them but in matthew arnold s dramatic poem the strayed reveller 1849 60 in which circe is one of the characters the power of her potion is differently interpreted the inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality between divine clarity and the poet s participatory and tragic vision of life in the poem circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy wreathed bowl on awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced he craves for it to be continued 61 sexual politics edit with the renaissance there began to be a reinterpretation of what it was that changed the men if it was not simply magic for socrates in classical times it had been gluttony overcoming their self control 62 but for the influential emblematist andrea alciato it was unchastity in the second edition of his emblemata 1546 therefore circe became the type of the prostitute his emblem 76 is titled cavendum a meretricibus its accompanying latin verses mention picus scylla and the companions of ulysses and concludes that circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason 63 his english imitator geoffrey whitney used a variation of alciato s illustration in his own choice of emblemes 1586 but gave it the new title of homines voluptatibus transformantur men are transformed by their passions 64 this explains her appearance in the nighttown section named after her in james joyce s novel ulysses written in the form of a stage script it makes of circe the brothel madam bella cohen bloom the book s protagonist fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man tamer named mr bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him like a horse 65 by the 19th century circe was ceasing to be a mythical figure poets treated her either as an individual or at least as the type of a certain kind of woman the french poet albert glatigny addresses circé in his les vignes folles 1857 and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream the magnet of masochistic fantasies 66 louis nicolas ménard s sonnet in rêveries d un païen mystique 1876 describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look but appearance belies the accursed reality 67 poets in english were not far behind in this lurid portrayal lord de tabley s circe 1895 is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip a flaunting bloom naked and undivine with freckled cheeks and splotch d side serpentine a gipsy among flowers 68 the kingdom of sorceress circe by angelo caroselli c 1630 that central image is echoed by the blood striped flower of t s eliot s student poem circe s palace 1909 in the harvard advocate circe herself does not appear her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond panthers pythons and peacocks that look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago 69 rather than a temptress she has become an emasculatory threat 70 several female poets make circe stand up for herself using the soliloquy form to voice the woman s position the 19th century english poet augusta webster much of whose writing explored the female condition has a dramatic monologue in blank verse titled circe in her volume portraits 1870 71 there the sorceress anticipates her meeting with ulysses and his men and insists that she does not turn men into pigs she merely takes away the disguise that makes them seem human but any draught pure water natural wine out of my cup revealed them to themselves and to each other change there was no change only disguise gone from them unawares the mythological character of the speaker contributes at a safe remove to the victorian discourse on women s sexuality by expressing female desire and criticizing the subordinate role given to women in heterosexual politics 72 two american poets also explored feminine psychology in poems ostensibly about the enchantress leigh gordon giltner s circe was included in her collection the path of dreams 1900 the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned into swine by her spell but then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman very much in the french vein once more it concludes a circe s spells transform men into swine 73 this is no passive victim of male projections but a woman conscious of her sexual power so too is hilda doolittle s circe from her collection hymen 1921 in her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored then mourns the one instance when she failed in not naming ulysses himself doolittle universalises an emotion with which all women might identify 74 at the end of the century british poet carol ann duffy wrote a monologue entitled circe which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of nereids and nymphs in this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked 75 another indication of the progression in interpreting the circe figure is given by two poems a century apart both of which engage with paintings of her the first is the sonnet that dante gabriel rossetti wrote in response to edward burne jones the wine of circe in his volume poems 1870 it gives a faithful depiction of the painting s pre raphaelite mannerism but its description of circe s potion as distilled of death and shame also accords with the contemporary male identification of circe with perversity this is further underlined by his statement in a letter that the black panthers there are images of ruined passion and by his anticipation at the end of the poem of passion s tide strown shore where the disheveled seaweed hates the sea 76 the australian a d hope s circe after the painting by dosso dossi on the other hand frankly admits humanity s animal inheritance as natural and something in which even circe shares in the poem he links the fading rationality and speech of her lovers to her own animal cries in the act of love 77 circe the temptress by charles hermans c 1859 1924 there remain some poems that bear her name that have more to do with their writers private preoccupations than with reinterpreting her myth the link with it in margaret atwood s circe mud poems first published in you are happy 1974 is more a matter of allusion and is nowhere overtly stated beyond the title it is a reflection on contemporary gender politics that scarcely needs the disguises of augusta webster s 78 with two other poems by male writers it is much the same louis macneice s for example whose circe appeared in his first volume poems london 1935 or robert lowell s whose ulysses and circe appeared in his last day by day new york 1977 both poets have appropriated the myth to make a personal statement about their broken relationships 79 parallels and sequels edit several renaissance epics of the 16th century include lascivious sorceresses based on the circe figure these generally live in an isolated spot devoted to pleasure to which lovers are lured and later changed into beasts they include the following alcina in the orlando furioso mad roland 1516 1532 of ludovico ariosto set at the time of charlemagne among its many sub plots is the episode in which the saracen champion ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress and has to be freed from her magic island 80 the lovers of filidia in il tancredi 1632 by ascanio grandi 1567 1647 have been changed into monsters and are liberated by the virtuous tancred 81 armida in torquato tasso s la gerusalemme liberata jerusalem delivered 1566 1575 published 1580 is a saracen sorceress sent by the infernal senate to sow discord among the crusaders camped before jerusalem where she succeeds in changing a party of them into animals planning to assassinate the hero rinaldo she falls in love with him instead and creates an enchanted garden where she holds him a lovesick prisoner who has forgotten his former identity 82 acrasia in edmund spenser s faerie queene mentioned above is a seductress of knights and holds them enchanted in her bower of bliss later scholarship has identified elements from the character of both circe and especially her fellow enchantress medea as contributing to the development of the mediaeval legend of morgan le fay 83 in addition it has been argued that the fairy titania in william shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream 1600 is an inversion of circe 84 titania daughter of the titans was a title by which the sorceress was known in classical times in this case the tables are turned on the character who is queen of the fairies she is made to love an ass after rather than before he is transformed into his true animal likeness william blake s 1815 watercolour of comus and his animal headed revellers it has further been suggested that john milton s mask presented at ludlow castle 1634 is a sequel to tempe restored a masque in which circe had figured two years earlier and that the situation presented there is a reversal of the greek myth 85 at the start of the masque the character comus is described as the son of circe by bacchus god of wine and the equal of his mother in enchantment he too changes travelers into beastly forms that roll with pleasure in a sensual sty having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair he stands over her wand in hand and presses on her a magical cup representing sexual pleasure and intemperance which she repeatedly refuses arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity 86 the picture presented is a mirror image of the classical story in place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue in the 20th century the circe episode was to be re evaluated in two poetic sequels to the odyssey in the first of these giovanni pascoli s l ultimo viaggio the last voyage 1906 the aging hero sets out to rediscover the emotions of his youth by retracing his journey from troy only to discover that the island of eea is deserted what in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and circe s song was now no more than the sound of the sea wind in autumnal oaks cantos 16 17 87 this melancholy dispelling of illusion is echoed in the odyssey a modern sequel 1938 by nikos kazantzakis the fresh voyage in search of new meaning to life recorded there grows out of the hero s initial rejection of his past experiences in the first two sections the circe episode is viewed by him as a narrow escape from death of the spirit with twisted hands and thighs we rolled on burning sands a hanging mess of hissing vipers glued in sun farewell the brilliant voyage ended prow and soul moored in the muddy port of the contented beast o prodigal much traveled soul is this your country his escape from this mire of sensuality comes one day when the sight of some fishermen a mother and her baby enjoying the simple comforts of food and drink recalls him to life its duties and delights 88 where the attempt by pascoli s hero to recapture the past ended in failure kazantzakis odysseus already realising the emptiness of his experiences journeys into what he hopes will be a fuller future visual representations edit ancient art edit circe on a 490 480 bc oil jar athens national archaeological museum scenes from the odyssey are common on greek pottery the circe episode among them the two most common representations have circe surrounded by the transformed sailors and odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword in the case of the former the animals are not always boars but also include for instance the ram dog and lion on the 6th century bc boston kylix 89 often the transformation is only partial involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail while the rest of the body is human in describing an otherwise obscure 5th century greek bronze in the walters art museum that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig 90 the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict someone bewitched other than as a man with an animal head 91 in these scenes circe is shown almost invariably stirring the potion with her wand although the incident as described in homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves 92 one exception is the berlin amphora on which the seated circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man 93 in the second scene odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword as homer describes it however he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well as in the athens lekythos 94 while homer reports that it was a bow he had slung over his shoulder 95 in this episode circe is generally shown in flight and on the erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her 96 two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the homeric detail of circe s handloom 97 at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked 98 in the 5th century skyphos from boeotia an apparently crippled odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl 99 in the other a pot bellied hero brandishes a sword while circe stirs her potion both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter little remains of these now beyond a few lines by aeschylus ephippus of athens and anaxilas other vase paintings from the period suggest that odysseus half transformed animal men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs 100 the reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot later writers were to follow socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness 101 other artefacts depicting the story include the chest of cypselus described in the travelogue by pausanias among its many carvings there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch i was of opinion that they were odysseus and circe basing my view upon the number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing for the women are four and they are engaged on the tasks which homer mentions in his poetry 102 the passage in question describes how one of them threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top another drew silver tables up to the chairs and laid out golden dishes while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl and served it in golden cups the fourth fetched water and lit a roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron 103 this suggests a work of considerable detail while the etruscan coffin preserved in orvieto s archaeological museum has only four figures at the centre odysseus threatens circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero s shoulder 104 a bronze mirror relief in the fitzwilliam museum is also etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters there a pig is depicted at circe s feet while odysseus and elpenor approach her swords drawn 105 portraits in character edit during the 18th century painters began to portray individual actors in scenes from named plays there was also a tradition of private performances with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes among these was thomas jefferys a collection of the dresses of different nations antient and modern 1757 72 which included a copperplate engraving of a crowned circe in loose dress holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left 106 evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character of which one of the earliest was the pastel by daniel gardner 1750 1805 of miss elliot as circe the artist had been a pupil of both george romney and joshua reynolds who themselves were soon to follow his example on the 1778 engraving based on gardner s portrait appear the lines from milton s comus the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup whoever tasted lost his upright shape and downward fell into a grovelling swine in compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house as in the jefferys plate she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left in hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role miss elliot is playing 107 the subjects of later paintings impersonating circe have a history of sexual experience behind them starting with mary spencer in the character of circe by william caddick which was exhibited at the royal academy in 1780 the subject here was the mistress of the painter george stubbs 108 a portrait of mrs nesbitt as circe by reynolds followed in 1781 though this lady s past was ambiguous she had connections with those in power and was used by the government as a secret agent in the painting she is seated sideways wearing a white loose fitting dress with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left a monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee 109 while the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character george romney s c 1782 portrait of emma hamilton as circe it was used to illustrate numerous books including wuthering heights soon afterwards the notorious emma hamilton was to raise this to an art form partly by the aid of george romney s many paintings of her impersonations romney s preliminary study of emma s head and shoulders at present in the tate gallery with its piled hair expressive eyes and mouth is reminiscent of samuel gardener s portrait of miss elliot 110 in the full length lady hamilton as circe at waddesdon manor she is placed in a wooded landscape with wolves snarling to her left although the tiger originally there has now been painted out her left arm is raised to cast a spell while the wand points downward in her right 111 after emma moved to naples and joined lord hamilton she developed what she called her attitudes into a more public entertainment specially designed loose fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from classical mythology these developed from mere poses with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed into small wordless charades 112 the tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries one of the photographic series by julia margaret cameron a pupil of the painter george frederic watts was of mythical characters for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models young kate keown sat for the head of circe in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character s use of wine to bring a change in personality 113 the society portrait photographer yevonde middleton also known as madame yevonde was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball as the foundation for her own series of mythological portraits in colour its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes there baroness dacre is pictured as circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large baroque porcelain goblet 114 a decade earlier the illustrator charles edmund brock extended into the 20th century what is almost a pastiche of the 18th century conversation piece in his circe and the sirens 1925 in this the honourable edith chaplin 1878 1959 marchioness of londonderry and her three youngest daughters are pictured in a garden setting grouped about a large pet goat 115 three women painters also produced portraits using the convention of the sitter in character the earliest was beatrice offor 1864 1920 whose sitter s part in her 1911 painting of circe is suggested by the vine leaf crown in her long dark hair the snake twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm 116 mary cecil allen was of australian origin 117 but was living in the united states at the time miss audrey stevenson as circe was painted 1930 though only a head and shoulders sketch its colouring and execution suggest the sitter s lively personality 118 rosemary valodon born 1947 from the same country painted a series of australian personalities in her goddess series margarita georgiadis as circe 1991 is a triptych the central panel of which portrays an updated naked femme fatale reclining in tropical vegetation next to a pig s head 119 one painting at least depicts an actress playing the part of circe this is franz von stuck s striking portrait of tilla durieux as circe 1913 she played this part in a viennese revival of calderon s play in 1912 and there is a publicity still of her by isidor hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown 120 her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of van stuck s enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl it suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past a nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of mme geneviève vix as circe in the light opera by lucien hillenacher at the opéra comique in paris 121 the posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical a later example is the still of silvana mangano in her part as circe in the 1954 film ulysses which is as cunningly posed for effect musical treatments edit cantata and song edit wright barker s 1889 painting of circe as musician beside the verse dramas with their lyrical interludes on which many operas were based there were poetic texts which were set as secular cantatas one of the earliest was alessandro stradella s la circe in a setting for three voices that bordered on the operatic it was first performed at frascati in 1667 to honour cardinal leopoldo de medici and contained references to its surroundings in the opening recitative circe explains that it was her son telegonus who founded frascati the other characters with whom she enters into dialogue are the south wind zeffiro and the local river algido 122 in the following century antonio vivaldi s cantata all ombra di sospetto in the shadow of doubt rv 678 is set for a single voice and depicts circe addressing ulysses the countertenor part is accompanied by flute harpsichord cello and theorbo and features two recitatives and two arias the piece is famous for the dialogue created between flute and voice conjuring the moment of flirtation before the two become lovers 123 the most successful treatment of the ulysses episode in french was jean baptiste rousseau s poem circé 1703 that was specifically written to be a cantata the different verse forms employed allow the piece to be divided by the musicians that set it in order to express a variety of emotions the poem opens with the abandoned circe sitting on a high mountain and mourning the departure of ulysses the sorceress then calls on the infernal gods and makes a terrible sacrifice a myriad vapours obscure the light the stars of the night interrupt their course astonished rivers retreat to their source and even death s god trembles in the dark but though the earth is shaken to its core love is not to be commanded in this way and the wintery fields come back to life 124 the earliest setting was by jean baptiste morin in 1706 and was popular for most of the rest of the century one of its final moralising minuets ce n est point par effort qu on aime love won t be forced was often performed independently and the score reprinted in many song collections the flautist michel blavet arranged the music for this and the poem s final stanza dans les champs que l hiver désole in the fields that winter wastes for two flutes in 1720 the new setting of the cantata three years later by francois collin de blamont was equally successful and made the name of its nineteen year old composer originally for voice and bass continuo it was expanded and considerably revised in 1729 with parts for flute violin and viol added 125 towards the end of the century the choral setting by georges granges de fontenelle 1769 1819 was equally to bring its young composer fame 126 rousseau s poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities set for mezzo soprano and full orchestra it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer luigi cherubini in 1789 franz seydelmann set it for soprano and full orchestra in dresden in 1787 at the request of the russian ambassador to the saxon court prince alexander belosselsky who spoke highly of seydelmann s work a later setting by austrian composer sigismond von neukomm for soprano and full orchestra op 4 1810 was judged favorably by french musicologist jacques chailley in his 1966 article for the journal revue des études slaves 127 128 recent treatments of the circe theme include the irish composer gerard victory s radio cantata circe 1991 1973 75 david gribble s a threepenny odyssey a fifteen minute cantata for young people which includes the episode on circe s isle and malcolm hayes odysseus remembers 2003 04 which includes parts for circe anticleia and tiresias gerald humel s song cycle circe 1998 grew out of his work on his 1993 ballet with thomas höft the latter subsequently wrote seven poems in german featuring circe s role as seductress in a new light here it is to freedom and enlightenment that she tempts her hearers 129 another cycle of seven songs for high voice and piano 2008 by the american composer martin hennessey includes the poem circe s power from louise glück s meadowlands 1997 130 there have also been treatments of circe in popular music in particular the relation of the odysseus episode in friedrich holländer s song of 1958 131 in addition text in homeric greek is included in the circe s island episode in david bedford s the odyssey 1976 132 this was the ancestor of several later electronic suites that reference the odysseus legend with circe titles among them having little other programmatic connection with the myth itself classical ballet and programmatic music edit after classical ballet separated from theatrical spectacle into a wordless form in which the story is expressed solely through movement the subject of circe was rarely visited it figured as the first episode of three with mythological themes in les fêtes nouvelles new shows staged by sieur duplessis le cadet in 1734 but the work was taken off after its third performance and not revived 133 the choreographer antoine pitrot also staged ulysse dans l isle de circée describing it as a ballet sérieux heroï pantomime in 1764 134 thereafter there seems to be nothing until the revival of ballet in the 20th century circe enchanting ulysses in the 2012 revival of martha graham s circe in 1963 the american choreographer martha graham created her circe with a score by alan hovhaness its theme is psychological representing the battle with animal instincts the beasts portrayed extend beyond swine and include a goat a snake a lion and a deer 135 the theme has been described as one of highly charged erotic action although set in a world where sexual frustration is rampant 136 in that same decade rudolf brucci composed his kirka 1967 in croatia there is a circe episode in john harbison s ulysses act 1 scene 2 1983 in which the song of the enchantress is represented by ondes martenot and tuned percussion 137 after the sailors of ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell a battle of wills follows between circe and the hero though the men are changed back ulysses is charmed by her in his turn in 1993 a full scale treatment of the story followed in gerald humel s two act circe und odysseus also psychological in intent it represents circe s seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful the part played by the geometrical set in its berlin production was particularly notable 138 while operas on the subject of circe did not cease they were overtaken for a while by the new musical concept of the symphonic poem which whilst it does not use a sung text similarly seeks a union of music and drama 139 a number of purely musical works fall into this category from the late 19th century onwards of which one of the first was heinrich von herzogenberg s odysseus op 16 1873 a wagnerian symphony for large orchestra dealing with the hero s return from the trojan war its third section is titled circe s gardens die gärten der circe in the 20th century ernst boehe s cycle aus odysseus fahrten from odysseus voyage op 6 1903 was equally programmatic and included the visit to circe s isle die insel der circe as its second long section after a depiction of the sea voyage a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment suggesting circe s seductive attempt to hold odysseus back from traveling further 140 alan hovhaness circe symphony no 18 op 204a 1963 is a late example of such programmatic writing it is in fact only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year with the addition of more strings a second timpanist and celesta with the exception of willem frederik bon s prelude for orchestra 1972 most later works have been for a restricted number of instruments they include hendrik de regt s circe op 44 1975 for clarinet violin and piano christian manen s les enchantements de circe op 96 1975 for bassoon and piano and jacques lenot s cir c é 1986 for oboe d amore the german experimental musician dieter schnebel s circe 1988 is a work for harp the various sections of which are titled signale signals säuseln whispers verlockungen enticements pein pain schläge strokes and umgarnen snare which give some idea of their programmatic intent thea musgrave s circe for three flutes 1996 was eventually to become the fourth piece in her six part voices from the ancient world for various combinations of flute and percussion 1998 her note on these explains that their purpose is to describe some of the personages of ancient greece and that circe was the enchantress who changed men into beasts 141 a recent reference is the harpsichordist fernando de luca s sonata ii for viola da gamba titled circe s cave l antro della maga circe opera edit

video a construction worker uses a jackhammer in japan a jackhammer pneumatic drill or demolition hammer in british english is a pneumatic or electro mechanical tool that combines a hammer directly with a chisel it was invented by william mcreavy who then sold the patent to charles brady king 1 hand held jackhammers are generally powered by compressed air but some are also powered by electric motors larger jackhammers such as rig mounted hammers used on construction machinery are usually hydraulically powered these tools are typically used to break up rock pavement and concrete a jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down the hammer is first driven down to strike the chisel and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle the effectiveness of the jackhammer is dependent on how much force is applied to the tool it is generally used like a hammer to break the hard surface or rock in construction works and it is not considered under earth moving equipment along with its accessories i e pusher leg lubricator in british english electromechanical versions are colloquially known as kangos contents 1 history 2

patented by samuel miller in 1806 the drill used steam only for raising the drill 2 pneumatic drills were developed in response to the needs of mining quarrying excavating and tunneling a pneumatic drill was proposed by a c brunton in 1844 3 4 in 1846 a percussion drill that could be worked by steam or atmospheric pressure obtained from a vacuum was patented in britain by thomas clarke mark freeman and john varley 5 the first american percussion drill was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by jonathan j couch of philadelphia pennsylvania 6 in that drill the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine the piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face it was an experimental model in 1849 couch s assistant joseph w fowle filed a patent caveat for a percussion drill of his own design in fowle s drill the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder specifically the drill bit was connected to the piston s crosshead the drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened 7 by 1850 or 1851 fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill making it the first true pneumatic drill 8 the demand for pneumatic drills was driven especially by miners and tunnelers because steam engines needed fires to operate and the ventilation in mines and tunnels was inadequate to vent the fires fumes as well mines and tunnels might contain flammable explosive gases such as methane there was also no way to convey steam over long distances such as from the surface to the bottom of a mine without it condensing by contrast compressed air could be conveyed over long distances without loss of its energy and after the compressed air had been used to power equipment it could ventilate a mine or tunnel in europe since the late 1840s the king of sardinia carlo alberto had been contemplating the excavation of a 12 kilometer 7 5 mi tunnel through mount fréjus to create a rail link between italy and france which would cross his realm 9 10 the need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and that sparked research in europe on pneumatic rock drills a frenchman françois cavé fr designed a rock drill that used compressed air which he patented in 1851 however the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke so it was not successful 11 in 1854 in england thomas bartlett made and then patented 1855 a rock drill the bit of which was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine in 1855 bartlett demonstrated his drill powered by compressed air to officials of the mount fréjus tunnel project 12 in 1855 a german schumann invented a similar pneumatic rock drill in freiburg germany 13 by 1861 bartlett s drill had been refined by the savoy born engineer germain sommeiller 1815 1871 and his colleagues grandis and grattoni 14 thereafter many inventors refined the pneumatic drill 15 sommeiller took his drill to the lengthy gotthard pass tunnel then being built to link railways between switzerland and italy under the alps from there mining and railway tunnelling expanded two equipment manufacturing companies atlas copco and ingersoll rand became dominant in the provision of compressed air drilling apparatus in europe and america respectively each holding significant patents terminology edit the word jackhammer is used in north american english and australia while pneumatic drill is used colloquially elsewhere in the english speaking world although strictly speaking a pneumatic drill refers to a pneumatically driven jackhammer 16 in britain electromechanical versions are colloquially known by the name of kangos 17 the term comes from the former british brand name now owned by milwaukee tools 18 use edit a gasoline powered breaker on a demolition site a full sized portable jackhammer is impractical for use against walls and steep slopes except by a very strong person as the user would have to both support the weight of the tool and push the tool back against the work after each blow a technique developed by experienced workers is a two man team to overcome this obstacle of gravity one operates the hammer and the second assists by holding the hammer either on his shoulders or cradled in his arms both use their combined weight to push the bit into the workface this method is commonly referred to as horizontal jackhammering another method is overhead jackhammering requiring strength conditioning and endurance to hold a smaller jackhammer called a rivet buster over one s head to make overhead work safer a platform can be used one such platform is a positioner actuator manipulator pam this unit takes all the weight and vibration from the user types edit pneumatic edit a compressor for running a pneumatic jackhammer a pneumatic jackhammer also known as a pneumatic drill or pneumatic hammer 19 is a jackhammer that uses compressed air as the power source the air supply usually comes from a portable air compressor driven by a diesel engine reciprocating compressors were formerly used the unit comprised a reciprocating compressor driven through a centrifugal clutch by a diesel engine the engine s governor provided only two speeds idling when the clutch was disengaged maximum when the clutch was engaged and the compressor was running modern versions use rotary compressors and have more sophisticated variable governors the unit is usually mounted on a trailer and sometimes includes an electrical generator to supply lights or electric power tools additionally some users of pneumatic jackhammers may use a pneumatic lubricator which is placed in series with the air hose powering the air hammer this increases the life and performance of the jackhammer electro mechanical or electropneumatic edit a single phase demolition breaker this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2010 an electropneumatic hammer is often called a rotary hammer because it has an electric motor which rotates a crank the hammer has two pistons a drive piston and a free flight piston the crank moves the drive piston back and forth in the same cylinder as the flight piston the drive piston never touches the flight piston instead the drive piston compresses air in the cylinder which then propels the flight piston against a striker which contacts the drill bit 20 electric powered tools come in a variety of sizes about 12 65 lb 5 4 29 5 kg they require an external power source but do not require a compressor although in the past these tools did not have the power of an air or pneumatic hammer this is changing with newer brushless motor tools coming close to the power of a pneumatic tool and in some cases even matching it electric powered tools are useful for locations where access to a compressor is limited or impractical such as inside a building in a crowded construction site or in a remote location and it is not uncommon under earth moving equipment or tool electropneumatic tools use a variety of chucks for attaching chisels but the most common are sds max 7 8 in hex te s and 1 1 8 in hex the connection end size is also related to the breaking energy of the tool for example the bosch and hilti 12 lb 5 4 kg tools both use sds max while the bosch hilti and makita 65 lb 29 kg tools all use 1 1 8 in hex connection see hammer drills for more on electropneumatic hammering hydraulic edit an excavator mounted hydraulic jackhammer being used to break up concrete note it is adding the weight of the forward half and boom of the machine to aid the driver s effectiveness a hydraulic breaker may be fitted to heavy equipment such as an excavator or backhoe and is widely used for roadwork quarrying construction sitework and general demolition 21 these larger machine mounted breakers are known as rig mounted or machine mounted breakers such tools can be used horizontally as they do not require the assist of gravity to do their work they typically use a hydraulic motor driving a sealed pneumatic hammer system as a hydraulically activated hammer would both develop a low strike speed and potentially transfer unacceptable shock loads to the pump system contrast this with a steam mechanical or hydraulically driven pile driver advances in technology have allowed for portable hydraulic breakers the jackhammer is connected with hydraulic hoses to a portable hydraulic powerpack either a petrol or diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump or a mini excavator or skid steer via a power take off driveshaft to the machine s hydraulic system hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors making the kit smaller cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version pneumatic or hydraulic tools are particularly likely to be used in underground mines where there is an explosion risk such as with coal since they do not required high voltage electricity to work eliminating much of the danger of spark induced detonation bits edit bit types include spade provides flat finish for concrete or edging in asphalt or dirt flat tip allows direction control or finer edge finish point general breaking stake driver drives concrete form stakes scabbler finishes surface smooth or for cleaning prior to bonding flex chisel flexible metal blade attached to shank with bolts for tile removal and scraping bushing tool multiple carbide points for cleaning up seams and knocking down rough spots in concrete sharpening chisels may be resharpened in a shop or with an angle grinder with grinding disc after resharpening they must then be heat treated to restore the integrity of the steel before use self sharpening polygon and flat chisels are also available health

with the explosive air exhaust makes pneumatic jackhammers dangerously loud emitting more than 120 db spl near the operator s ears 22 sound blocking earmuffs and earplugs must be worn by the operator to prevent a form of hearing loss of which tinnitus is the main symptom although some pneumatic jackhammers now have a silencer around the barrel of the tool loud air exhaust hammer blows themselves and compressor engine sounds remain unmuffled use has been linked to raynaud syndrome in particular prolonged exposure to the pronounced vibration conducted by the tool can lead to a secondary form of the syndrome known as vibration white finger 23 applying athletic tape is not very effective in preventing white finger but seems to help alleviate some of its discomfort pneumatic drill usage can also lead to a predisposition for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome air hose connection on pneumatic drill some manufacturers of electro pneumatic tools now offer vibration reduction systems to reduce the vibration felt by the operator for example hilti manufactures a jackhammer model that has approximately the same impact energy of a 60 lb 27 kg pneumatic hammer but the vibration felt by the operator is significantly less 7 m s2 other manufacturers such as makita dewalt and bosch also offer electric tools with vibration dampening in addition using a jackhammer to break up concrete pavement may expose the operator to hazardous dust containing respirable crystalline silica that may induce silicosis 24 the operator and those in the vicinity of the jackhammer operations should wear

differentiate him from captain marvel 2 fawcett staff artist mac raboy designed the new character named captain marvel jr using a more realistic style parting with c c beck s more cartoony artwork for the captain marvel stories 2 whereas captain marvel changed identities by saying shazam captain marvel jr says captain marvel to transform this was intended to serve as a frequent reminder to readers

of the 1595 atlas of mercator world map theatrum orbis terrarum theatre of the orb of the world by abraham ortelius 1570 blaeu s world map originally prepared by joan blaeu for his atlas maior published in the first book of the atlas van loon 1664 imperii orientalis et circumjacentium regionum by guillaume delisle 1742 an atlas is a collection of maps it is typically a bundle of maps of earth or of a region of earth atlases have traditionally been bound into book form but today many atlases are in multimedia formats in addition to presenting geographic features and political boundaries many atlases often feature geopolitical social religious and economic statistics they also have information about the map and places in it contents 1 etymology 2 history of atlases 3 types of atlases 4 selected atlases 5 see also 6 references 7 external links etymology edit the use of the word atlas in a geographical context dates from 1595 when the german flemish geographer gerardus mercator published atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe and the universe as created this title provides mercator s definition of the word as a description of the creation and form of the whole universe not simply as a collection of maps the volume that was published posthumously one year after his death is a wide ranging text but as the editions evolved it became simply a collection of maps and it is in that sense that the word was used from the middle of the 17th century the neologism coined by mercator was a mark of his respect for the titan atlas the king of mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer 1 history of atlases edit the first work that contained systematically arranged maps of uniform size representing the first modern atlas was prepared by italian cartographer pietro coppo in the early 16th century however it was not published at that time so it is conventionally not considered the first atlas rather that title is awarded to the collection of maps theatrum orbis terrarum by the brabantian cartographer abraham ortelius printed in 1570 however atlases published nowadays are quite different from those published in the 16th 19th centuries unlike today most atlases were not bound and ready for the customer to buy but their possible components were shelved separately the client could select the contents to their liking and have the maps coloured gilded or not the atlas was then bound thus early printed atlases with the same title page can be different in contents 2 states began producing national atlases in the 19th century 3 types of atlases edit a travel atlas is made for easy use during travel and often has

search queen of the amazons in greek mythology for other uses see hippolyte disambiguation hippolyta from promptuarii iconum insigniorum heracles obtaining the belt of hyppolita by nikolaus knüpfer in classical greek mythology hippolyta or hippolyte 1 hɪˈpɒlɪtə greek ἱππολύτη hippolytē was a daughter of ares and otrera queen of the amazons and a sister of antiope and melanippe she wore her father ares zoster the greek word found in the iliad and elsewhere meaning war belt 2 3 some traditional english translations have preferred the more feminine sounding girdle 1 hippolyta figures prominently in the myths of both heracles and theseus the myths about her are varied enough that they may therefore be about several different women 4 the name hippolyta comes from greek roots meaning horse and let loose 5 6 contents 1 legends 1 1 ninth labor of heracles 1 2 adventure of theseus 2 shakespeare character 3 classical literature sources 4 references 5 external links legends edit ninth labor of heracles edit in the myth of heracles hippolyta s belt ζωστὴρ ἱππολύτης was the object of his ninth labour he was sent to retrieve it for admete the daughter of king eurystheus 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 most versions of the myth indicate that hippolyta was so impressed with heracles that she gave him the belt without argument perhaps while visiting him on his ship then according to pseudo apollodorus the goddess hera making herself appear as one of the amazons spread a rumour among them that heracles and his crew were abducting their queen so the amazons attacked the ship in the fray that followed heracles slew hippolyta stripped her of the belt fought off the attackers and sailed away adventure of theseus edit in the myth of theseus the hero joined heracles in his expedition or went on a separate expedition later and was actually the one who had the encounter with hippolyta some versions say he abducted her some that heracles did the abducting but gave her to theseus as spoils and others say that she fell in love with theseus and betrayed the amazons by willingly leaving with him in any case she was taken to athens where she was wed to theseus in some renditions the other amazons became enraged at the marriage and attacked athens this was the attic war in which they were defeated by athenian forces under theseus or heracles in other renditions theseus later put hippolyta aside to marry phaedra so hippolyta rallied her amazons to attack the wedding ceremony when the defenders closed the doors on the attackers either hippolyta was killed theseus directly killed her in the fight she was accidentally killed by another amazon molpadia while fighting by theseus side or was accidentally killed by her sister penthesilea during this battle or in a separate incident this killer was in turn slain by theseus or achilles some stories paint theseus in a more favorable light saying that hippolyta was dead before he and phaedra were wed and this battle did not occur further complicating the narratives a number of ancient writers say the amazon in question was not hippolyta at all but her sister antiope melanippe or glauce moreover there are combined versions of the tale in which heracles abducts and kills hippolyta while theseus assisted by sthenelus and telamon abducts and marries antiope there are also stories that hippolyta or antiope later bore theseus a son hippolytus of athens 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 13 shakespeare character edit a wax sculpture of hippolyta at samsun in william shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream hippolyta is engaged to theseus the duke of athens in act i scene 1 she and he discuss their fast approaching wedding which will take place under the new moon in four days i i 2 theseus declares to hippolyta that although he wooed her with his sword he will wed her with pomp with triumph and with revelling and promises to begin a celebration that will continue until the wedding i i 19 the characterization of hippolyta in a midsummer night s dream as well as that of theseus like many other mytho historical characters found in shakespeare s plays is based on ancient biographical accounts found in plutarch s work parallel lives in the life of theseus according to plutarch it was hippolyta who concluded a four month long war between athens and the amazons with a peace treaty resulting in the marriage between theseus and hippolyta the dramatic representation of hippolyta and theseus in a midsummer night s dream however is entirely a product of the playwright s imagination the character of hippolyta

of pre civilization with amorality as such giganta s nature as a supposedly primitive human being was understood as granting her both animalistic and potentially malicious characteristics after

1998 in a story by wonder woman writer artist john byrne as a research scientist named dr doris zuel 3 no longer a gorilla mutated into a human form this post crisis version of the character was now a human being who transferred her consciousness into the body of a gorilla named giganta through a series of convoluted circumstances prescribed by several writers across several years zuel would subsequently transfer her consciousness again this time into the body of a red haired metahuman woman now possessing the ability to increase her size and mass zuel began using the gorilla s name

in size 14 compelling the villain to become less rational and more prone to violence she was corrected by her colleagues in the department of metahuman affairs they implied that giganta has overcome that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size 15 giganta in her one year later costume which she continued to use until the new 52 one year later giganta along with the cheetah and

enemies reappearing throughout the golden silver bronze and modern age of comics 2 over the decades dr psycho has undergone several minor updates as comics continuities have shifted and evolved though his distinctive physical appearance has remained largely faithful to artist harry g peter s original 1943 design after dc comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 in a publication event known as the

as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatreds as well as to be another embodiment of what he called less actively developed men emotionally misaligned who needed emotional reform by a love leader wonder woman william moulton marston s creation of doctor psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism marston a psychologist created doctor psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women the character was partly inspired by actor lon chaney man of a thousand faces and partly by marston s undergraduate advisor hugo münsterberg who was opposed to women s suffrage and feminism and was into metaphysics 3 doctor psycho was also one of several villains created for wonder woman who were occultists beguiling the masses for their own self enriching purposes as wonder woman s rogues and supporting cast were largely jettisoned during the period that robert kanigher wrote and edited the issues doctor psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the golden silver and bronze age adventures 4 the character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post crisis on infinite earths

7 upon his release he tortured and killed bradley who falsely confessed that marva was his willing accomplice psycho then kidnapped and tortured marva hypnotically compelling her to marry him and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments learning that he could use marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions at deception s urging he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of george washington claiming that women were hindering the war effort he also disguised himself as colonel darnell of military intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage with the aid of steve trevor and the holliday college girls wonder woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him

inventions impractical and his science a fake sivana took his family to the planet venus in a spaceship he had invented 10 there he stayed until his children were grown and earth not so backward as when he left it since his children were adults by 1940 his departure from earth would implicitly have been the late 1910s or early 1920s during his years away struggling to tame the venusian jungle

disambiguation man with a shield throwing a javelin javelin thrower bronze laconian style third quarter of the 6th century bc a javelin is a light spear designed primarily to be thrown historically as a ranged weapon but today predominantly for sport the javelin is almost always thrown by hand unlike the sling bow and crossbow which launch projectiles with the aid of a hand held mechanism however devices do exist to assist the javelin thrower in achieving greater distance such as spear throwers or the amentum a warrior or soldier armed primarily with one or more javelins is a javelineer the word javelin comes from middle english and it derives from old french javelin a diminutive of javelot which meant spear the word javelot probably originated from one of the celtic languages contents 1

prehistory edit there is archaeological evidence that javelins and throwing sticks were already in use by the last phase of the lower paleolithic seven spear like objects were found in a coal mine in the city of schöningen germany stratigraphic dating indicates that the weapons are about 400 000 years old 1 the excavated items were made of spruce picea trunk and were between 1 83 and 2 25 metres long they were manufactured with the maximum thickness and weight situated at the front end of the wooden shaft the frontal centre of gravity suggests that these weapons were used as javelins a fossilized horse shoulder blade with a projectile wound dated to 500 000 years ago was revealed in a gravel quarry in the village of boxgrove england studies suggested that the wound was probably caused by a javelin 2 3 4 classical age edit agrianian peltast this peltast holds three javelins one in his throwing hand and two in his pelte hand as additional ammunition ancient egypt edit in history of ancient egypt volume 1 1882 george rawlinson depicts the javelin as an offensive weapon used by the ancient egyptian military it was lighter in weight than that used by other nations he describes the ancient egyptian javelin s features it consisted of a long thin shaft sometimes merely pointed but generally armed with a head which was either leaf shaped or like the head of a spear or else four sided and attached to the shaft by projections at the angles 5 a strap or tasseled head was situated at the lower end of the javelin it allowed the javelin thrower to recover his javelin after throwing it 5 egyptian military trained from a young age in special military schools focusing on gymnastics to gain strength hardiness and endurance in childhood they learned to throw the javelin along with practicing archery and the battle axe when they grew older before entering a specific regiment 6 javelins were carried by egyptian light infantry as a main weapon and as an alternative to a spear or a bow and arrow generally along with a shield they also carried a curved sword a club or a hatchet as a side arm 7 an important part in battles is often assigned to javelin men whose weapons seem to inflict death at every blow 8 one or multiple javelins were also sometimes carried by egyptian war chariots in the quiver and or the bow case 9 beyond its military purpose the javelin was likely also a hunting instrument both to seek food and as a sport 10 this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it march 2009 ancient greece edit a depiction of a javelin thrower on an ancient greek vase ca 450 bc attributed to the painter of the brussels oinochoes the peltasts usually serving as skirmishers were armed with several javelins often with throwing straps to increase stand off power the peltasts hurled their javelins at the enemy s heavier troops the hoplite phalanx in order to break their lines so that their own army s hoplites could destroy the weakened enemy formation in the battle of lechaeum the athenian general iphicrates took advantage of the fact that a spartan hoplite phalanx operating near corinth was moving in the open field without the protection of any missile throwing troops he decided to ambush it with his force of peltasts by launching repeated hit and run attacks against the spartan formation iphicrates and his men were able to wear the spartans down eventually routing them and killing just under half this marked the first recorded occasion in ancient greek military history in which a force entirely made up of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites the thureophoroi and thorakitai who gradually replaced the peltasts carried javelins in addition to a long thrusting spear and a short sword javelins were often used as an effective hunting weapon the strap adding enough power to take down large game javelins were also used in the ancient olympics and other panhellenic games they were hurled in a certain direction and whoever hurled it the farthest as long as it hit tip first won that game ancient rome edit main article pilum republic and early empire edit reconstruction of a post marian pilum in 387 bc the gauls invaded italy inflicted a crushing defeat on the roman republican army and sacked rome after this defeat the romans undertook a comprehensive reform of their army and changed the basic tactical formation from the greek style phalanx armed with the hasta spear and the clipeus round shield to a more flexible three line formation the hastati stood in the first line the principes in the second line and the triarii in the third line while the triarii were still armed with hastae the hastati and the principes were rearmed with short swords and heavy javelins each soldier from the hastati and principes lines carried two javelins this heavy javelin known as a pilum plural pila was about two metres long overall consisting of an iron shank about 7 mm in diameter and 60 cm long with pyramidal head secured to a wooden shaft the iron shank was either socketed or more usually widened to a flat tang a pilum usually weighed between 2 and 5 pounds 0 9 and 2 3 kg citation needed with the versions produced during the empire being somewhat lighter pictorial evidence suggests that some versions of the weapon were weighted with a lead ball at the base of the shank in order to increase penetrative power but no archaeological specimens have been found 11 recent experiments have shown pila to have a range of about 30 metres although the effective range is only 15 to 20 metres pila were sometimes referred to as javelins but the archaic term for the javelin was verutum from the third century bc the roman legion added a skirmisher type of soldier to its tactical formation the velites were light infantry armed with short swords the gladius or pugio small round shields and several small javelins these javelins were called veruta singular verutum the velites typically drew near the enemy hurled javelins against their formation and then retreated behind the legion s heavier infantry the velites were considered highly effective in turning back war elephants on account of discharging a hail of javelins at some range and not presenting a block that could be trampled on or otherwise smashed unlike the close order infantry behind them at the battle of zama in 202 bc the javelin throwing velites proved their worth and were no doubt critical in helping to herd hannibal s war elephants through the formation to be slaughtered the velites would slowly have been either disbanded or re equipped as more heavily armed legionaries from the time when gaius marius and other roman generals reorganised the army in the late second and early first centuries bc their role would most likely have been taken by irregular auxiliary troops as the republic expanded overseas the verutum was a cheaper missile weapon than the pilum the verutum was a short range weapon with a simply made head of soft iron legionaries of the late republic and early empire often carried two pila with one sometimes being lighter than the other standard tactics called for a roman soldier to throw his pilum both if there was time at the enemy just before charging to engage with his gladius some pila had small hand guards to protect the wielder if he intended to use it as a melee weapon but it does not appear that this was common late empire edit in the late roman empire the roman infantry came to use a differently shaped javelin from the earlier pilum this javelin was lighter and had a greater range called a plumbata it resembled a thick stocky arrow fletched with leather vanes to provide stability and rotation in flight which increased accuracy to overcome its comparatively small mass the plumbata was fitted with an oval shaped lead weight socketed around the shaft just forward of the center of balance giving the weapon its name even so plumbatae were much lighter than pila and would not have had the armour penetration or shield transfixing capabilities of their earlier counterparts two or three plumbatae were typically clipped to a small wooden bracket on the inside of the large oval or round shields used at the time massed troops would unclip and hurl plumbatae as the enemy neared hopefully stalling their movement and morale by making them clump together and huddle under their shields with the enemy deprived of rapid movement and their visibility impaired by their own raised shields the roman troops were then better placed to exploit the tactical situation it is unlikely plumbatae were viewed by the romans as the killing blow but more as a means of stalling the enemy at ranges greater than previously provided by the heavier and shorter ranged pilum gaul edit the gallic cavalry used to hurl several javelin volleys to soften the enemy before a frontal attack the gallic cavalry used their javelins in a tactic similar to that of horse archers parthian shot the gauls knew how to turn on horseback to throw javelins backwards while appearing to retreat iberia edit the hispanic cavalry was a light cavalry armed with falcatas and several light javelins the cantabri tribes invented a military tactic to maximize the advantages of the combination between horse and javelin in this tactic the horsemen rode around in circles toward and away from the enemy continually hurling javelins the tactic was usually employed against heavy infantry the constant movement of the horsemen gave them an advantage against slow infantry and made them hard to target the maneuver was designed to harass and taunt the enemy forces disrupting close formations this was commonly used against enemy infantry especially the heavily armed and slow moving legions of the romans this tactic came to be known as the cantabrian circle in the late republic various auxiliary cavalry completely replaced the italian cavalry contingents and the hispanic auxiliary cavalry was considered the best numidia edit the numidians were indigenous tribes of northwest africa the numidian cavalry was a light cavalry usually operating as skirmishers the numidian horseman was armed with a small shield and several javelins the numidians had a reputation as swift horsemen cunning soldiers and excellent javelin throwers it is said that jugurtha the numidian king took part in the national pursuits of riding javelin throwing and competed with other young men in running sallust the jugurthine war 6 the numidian cavalry served as mercenaries in the carthaginian army and played a key role in assisting both hannibal and scipio during the second punic war middle ages edit norman cavalry armed with lances attacks the anglo saxon shield wall notice the dominance of the spearmen in the front line of the formation in the back of the formation there is one warrior armed with a battle axe one archer and one javelineer there are javelins in mid flight and slain soldiers pierced with javelins on the ground norse edit there is some literary and archeological evidence that the norse were familiar with and used the javelin for hunting and warfare but they commonly used a spear designed for both throwing and thrusting the old norse word for javelin was frakka 12 anglo saxons edit the anglo saxon term for javelin was france 13 in anglo saxon warfare soldiers usually formed a shield wall and used heavy weapons like danish axes swords and spears javelins including barbed angons were used as an offensive weapon from behind the shield wall or by warriors who left the protective formation and attacked the enemy as skirmishers 14 designed to be difficult to remove from either flesh or wood the angon javelin used by anglo saxon warriors was an effective means of disabling an opponent or his shield thus having the potential to disrupt opposing shield walls 15 iberia edit the almogavars were a class of aragonese infantrymen armed with a short sword a shield and two heavy javelins known as azcona 16 the equipment resembled that of a roman legionary and the use of the heavy javelins was much the same the jinetes were arabic light horsemen armed with several javelins a sword and a shield they were proficient at skirmishing and rapid maneuver and played an important role in arabic mounted warfare throughout the reconquista until the sixteenth century these units were widespread among the italian infantrymen of the fifteenth century 17 wales edit the welsh particularly those of north wales used the javelin as one of their main weapons during the norman and later english invasions the primary welsh tactic was to rain javelins on the tired hungry and heavily armoured english troops and then retreat into the mountains or woods before the english troops could pursue and attack them this tactic was very successful since it demoralized and damaged the english armies while the welsh ranks suffered little ireland edit the kern of ireland used javelins as their main weapon as they accompanied the more heavily armoured galloglass chinese edit various kingdoms and dynasties in china have used javelins such as the iron headed javelin of the qing dynasty 18 qi jiguang s anti pirate army included javelin throwers with shields 19 modern age edit africa edit the only known drawing of shaka notice the long throwing assegai flag of eswatini many african kingdoms have used the javelin as their main weapon since ancient times typical african warfare was based on ritualized stand off encounters involving throwing javelins without advancing for close combat in the flag of eswatini there is a shield and two javelins which symbolize the protection from the country s enemies zulu edit the zulu warriors used a long version of the assegai javelin as their primary weapon the zulu legendary leader shaka initiated military reforms in which a short stabbing spear with a long swordlike spearhead named iklwa had become the zulu warrior s main weapon and was used as a mêlée weapon the assegai was not discarded but was used for an initial missile assault with the larger shields introduced by shaka to the zulu army the short spears used as stabbing swords and the opening phase of javelin attack the zulu regiments were quite similar to the roman legion with its scutum gladius and pilum tactical combination mythology edit norse mythology edit in norse mythology odin the chief god carried a javelin or spear called gungnir it was created by a group of dwarves known as the sons of ivaldi who also fashioned the ship of freyr called skidbladnir and the golden hair of sif 20 it had the property of always finding its mark the spear never stopped in its thrust 21 during the final conflict of ragnarok between the gods and giants odin will use gungnir to attack the wolf fenrir before being devoured by him 22 during the war and subsequent alliance between the aesir and vanir at the dawn of time odin hurled a javelin over the enemy host 23 which according to custom was thought to bring good fortune or victory to the thrower 24 odin also wounded himself with a spear while hanging from yggdrasil the world tree in his ritual quest for knowledge 25 but in neither case is the weapon referred to specifically as gungnir when the god baldr began to have prophetic dreams of his own death his mother frigg extracted an oath from all things in nature not to harm him however she neglected the mistletoe thinking it was too young to make let alone respect such a solemn vow when loki learned of this weakness he had a javelin or dart made from one of its branches and tricked hod the blind god into hurling it at baldr and causing his death 26 lusitanian mythology edit the god runesocesius is identified as a god of the javelin citation

decline of greco roman polytheism julian restoration modern restoration religion portal ancient greece portalvte ares ˈɛəriːz ancient greek ἄρης árēs árɛːs is the greek god of war and courage he is one of the twelve olympians and the son of zeus and hera the greeks were ambivalent towards him he embodies the physical valor necessary for success in war but can also personify sheer brutality and bloodlust in contrast to his sister the armored athena whose martial functions include military strategy and generalship an association with ares endows places objects and other deities with a savage dangerous or militarized quality although ares name shows his origins as mycenaean his reputation for savagery was thought by some to reflect his likely origins as a thracian deity some cities in greece and several in asia minor held annual festivals to bind and detain him as their protector in parts of asia minor he was an oracular deity still further away from greece the scythians were said to ritually kill one in a hundred prisoners of war as an offering to their equivalent of ares the later belief that ancient spartans had offered human sacrifice to ares may owe more to mythical prehistory misunderstandings and reputation than to reality though there are many literary allusions to ares love affairs and children he has a limited role in greek mythology when he does appear he is often humiliated in the trojan war aphrodite protector of troy persuades ares to take the trojan s side the trojans lose while ares sister athena helps the greeks to victory most famously when the craftsman god hephaestus discovers his wife aphrodite is having an affair with ares he traps the lovers in a net and exposes them to the ridicule of the other gods ares nearest counterpart in roman religion is mars who was given a more important and dignified place in ancient roman religion as ancestral protector of the roman people and state during the hellenization of latin literature the myths of ares were reinterpreted by roman writers under the name of mars and in later western art and literature the mythology of the two figures became virtually indistinguishable contents 1 names 2

imprecation 1 walter burkert notes that ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle war 2 r s p beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name 3 the earliest attested form of the name is the mycenaean greek 𐀀𐀩 a re written in the linear b syllabic script 4 5 6 the adjectival epithet areios warlike was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare zeus areios athena areia even aphrodite areia the warlike fully armoured and armed aphrodite areia was partnered with ares in sparta and was represented at kythira s temple to aphrodite urania 7 in the iliad the word ares is used as a common noun synonymous with battle 2 one epithet of ares in the classical period is enyalios a name which seems to appear on the mycenaean kn v 52 tablet as 𐀁𐀝𐀷𐀪𐀍 e nu wa ri jo 8 9 enyalios was sometimes identified with ares and sometimes differentiated from him as another war god with separate cult even in the same town burkert describes them as doubles almost 10 11 worship cult and ritual in mainland greece and the peloponnese only a few places are known to have had a formal temple and cult of ares 12 n 1 pausanias 2nd century ad notes an altar to ares at olympia 13 and the moving of a temple of ares to the athenian agora during the reign of augustus essentially rededicating it 2 ad as a roman temple to the augustan mars ultor 12 the areopagus mount of ares a natural rock outcrop in athens some distance from the acropolis was supposedly where ares was tried and acquitted by the gods for his revenge killing of poseidon s son halirrhothius who had raped ares daughter alcippe its name was used for the court that met there mostly to investigate and try potential cases of treason 14 numismatist m jessop price states that ares typified the traditional spartan character but had no important cult in sparta 15 and he never occurs on spartan coins 16 gonzalez observes in his 2005 survey of ares cults in asia minor that cults to ares on the greek mainland may have been more common than some sources assert 17 wars between greek states were endemic war and warriors provided his tribute and fed his insatiable appetite for battle 18 ares attributes are instruments of war a helmet shield and sword or spear 19 chained statues gods were immortal but could be bound and restrained both in mythic narrative and in cult practice there was an archaic spartan statue of ares in chains in the temple of enyalios sometimes regarded as the son of ares sometimes as ares himself which pausanias claimed meant that the spirit of war and victory was to be kept in the city n 2 the spartans are known to have ritually bound the images of other deities including aphrodite and artemis cf ares and aphrodite bound by hephaestus and in other places there were chained statues of artemis and dionysos 21 22 statues of ares in chains are described in the instructions given by an oracle of the late hellenistic era to various cities of pamphylia in anatolia including syedra lycia and cilicia places almost perpetually under threat from pirates each was told to set up a statue of bloody man slaying ares and provide it with an annual festival in which it was ritually bound with iron fetters by dike and hermes as if a supplicant for justice put on trial and offered sacrifice the oracle promises that thus will he become a peaceful deity for you once he has driven the enemy horde far from your country and he will give rise to prosperity much prayed for this ares karpodotes giver of fruits is well attested in lycia and pisidia 23 sacrifices like most greek deities ares was given animal sacrifice in sparta after battle he was given an ox for a victory by stratagem or a rooster for victory through onslaught 24 n 3 the usual recipient of sacrifice before battle was athena reports of historic human sacrifice to ares in an obscure rite known as the hekatomphonia represent a very long standing error repeated through several centuries and well into the modern era n 4 the hekatomphonia was an animal sacrifice to zeus it could be offered by any warrior who had personally slain one hundred of the enemy n 5 25 26 pausanias reports that in sparta each company of youths sacrificed a puppy to enyalios before engaging in a hand to hand fight without rules at the phoebaeum n 6 28 the chthonic night time sacrifice of a dog to enyalios became assimilated to the cult of ares 29 porphyry claims without detail that apollodorus of athens circa second century bc says the spartans made human sacrifices to ares but this may be a reference to mythic pre history 30 thrace and scythia a thracian god identified by herodotus c 484 c 425 bc as ares through interpretatio graeca was one of three otherwise unnamed deities that thracian commoners were said to worship herodotus recognises and names the other two as dionysus and artemis and claims that the thracian aristocracy exclusively worshiped hermes 31 32 in herodotus histories the scythians worship an indigenous form of greek ares who is otherwise unnamed but ranked beneath tabiti whom herodotus claims as a form of hestia api and papaios in scythia s divine hierarchy his cult object was an iron sword the scythian ares was offered blood sacrifices or ritual killings of cattle horses and one in every hundred human war captives whose blood was used to douse the sword statues and complex platform altars made of heaped brushwood were devoted to him this sword cult or one very similar is said to have persisted among the alans 33 some have posited that the sword of mars in later european history alludes to the huns having adopted ares 34 asia minor in some parts of asia minor ares was a prominent oracular deity something not found in any hellennic cult to ares or roman cult to mars ares was linked in some regions or polities with a local god or cultic hero and recognised as a higher more prestigious deity than in mainland greece his cults in southern asia minor are attested from the 5th century bc and well into the later roman imperial era at 29 different sites and on over 70 local coin issues 35 he is sometimes represented on coinage of the region by the helmet of ares or carrying a spear and a shield or as a fully armed warrior sometimes accompanied by a female deity in what is now western turkey the hellenistic city of metropolis built a monumental temple to ares as the city s protector not before the 3rd century bc it is now lost but the names of some of its priests and priestesses survive along with the temple s likely depictions on coins of the province 36 crete a sanctuary of aphrodite was established at sta lenika on crete between the cities of lato and olus possibly during the geometric period it was rebuilt in the late 2nd century bc as a double sanctuary to ares and aphrodite 37 inscriptions record disputes over the ownership of the sanctuary the names of ares and aphrodite appear as witness to sworn oaths and there is a victory thanks offering to aphrodite whom millington believes had capacity as a warrior protector acting in the realm of ares there were cultic links between the sta lenika sanctuary knossos and other cretan states and perhaps with argos on the mainland 38 while the greek literary and artistic record from both the archaic and classical eras connects ares and aphrodite as complementary companions and ideal though adulterous lovers their cult pairing and aphrodite as warrior protector is localised to crete 39 40 aksum in africa maḥrem the principal god of the kings of aksum prior to the 4th century ad was invoked as ares in greek inscriptions the anonymous king who commissioned the monumentum adulitanum in the late 2nd or early 3rd century refers to my greatest god ares who also begat me through whom i brought under my sway various peoples the monumental throne celebrating the king s conquests was itself dedicated to ares 41 in the early 4th century the last pagan king of aksum ezana referred to the one who brought me forth the invincible ares 42 characterisation the ares borghese ares was one of the twelve olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the iliad and odyssey in greek literature ares often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality and bloodlust overwhelming insatiable in battle destructive and man slaughtering as burkert puts it in contrast to his sister the armored athena whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship 43 an association with ares endows places and objects with a savage dangerous or militarized quality 44 but when ares does appear in myths he typically faces humiliation 45 in the iliad zeus expresses a recurring greek revulsion toward the god when ares returns wounded and complaining from the battlefield at troy then looking at him darkly zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him do not sit beside me and whine you double faced liar to me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold olympus forever quarrelling is dear to your heart wars and battles and yet i will not long endure to see you in pain sinceyou are my child and it was to me that your mother bore you but were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky 46 this ambivalence is expressed also in the greeks association of ares with the thracians whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people 47 thrace was considered to be ares s birthplace and his refuge after the affair with aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods n 7 a late 6th century bc funerary inscription from attica emphasizes the consequences of coming under ares s sway stay and mourn at the tomb of dead kroisoswhom raging ares destroyed one day fighting in the foremost ranks 48 hymns homeric hymn 8 to ares

feather darts in defense of the amazons shrine to ares as father of their queen on a coastal island in the black sea 51 founding of thebes ares played a central role in the founding myth of thebes as the progenitor of the water dragon slain by cadmus the dragon s teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprang up as the fully armored autochthonic spartoi cadmus placed himself in the god s service for eight years to atone for killing the dragon 19 to further propitiate ares cadmus married harmonia a daughter of ares s union with aphrodite in this way cadmus harmonized all strife and founded the city of thebes 2 in reality thebes came to dominate boeotia s great and fertile plain which in both history and myth was a battleground for competing polities 52 according to plutarch the plain was anciently described as the dancing floor of ares 53 aphrodite in homer s odyssey in the tale sung by the bard in the hall of alcinous 54 the sun god helios once spied ares and aphrodite having sex secretly in the hall of hephaestus her husband 55 helios reported the incident to hephaestus contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act hephaestus fashioned a finely knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them at the appropriate time this net was sprung and trapped ares and aphrodite locked in very private embrace n 8 but hephaestus was not satisfied with his revenge so he invited the olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair for the sake of modesty the goddesses demurred but the male gods went to witness the sight some commented on the beauty of aphrodite others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with ares but all who were present mocked the two once the couple was released the embarrassed ares returned to his homeland thrace and aphrodite went to paphos n 8 45 in a much later interpolated detail ares put the young soldier alectryon who was ares companion in drinking and even love making by his door to warn them of helios s arrival as helios would tell hephaestus of aphrodite s infidelity if the two were discovered but alectryon fell asleep on guard duty 56 helios discovered the two and alerted hephaestus the furious ares turned the sleepy alectryon into a rooster which now always announces the arrival of the sun in the morning as a way of apologizing to ares 57 the chorus of aeschylus suppliants written 463 bc refers to ares as aphrodite s mortal destroying bedfellow in the illiad ares helps the trojans because of his affection for their divine protector aphrodite she thus redirects his innate destructive savagery to her own purposes 39 40 giants in one archaic myth related only in the iliad by the goddess dione to her daughter aphrodite two chthonic giants the aloadae named otus and ephialtes bound ares in chains and imprisoned him in a bronze urn where he remained for thirteen months a lunar year and that would have been the end of ares and his appetite for war if the beautiful eriboea the young giants stepmother had not told hermes what they had done she related 58 in this burkert suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month 59 60 ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until hermes rescued him and artemis tricked the aloadae into slaying each other in nonnus s dionysiaca in the war between cronus and zeus ares killed an unnamed giant son of echidna who was allied with cronus and described as spitting horrible poison and having snaky feet 61 iliad cast of a roman statue from hadrian s villa copied from a greek original traditionally identified as ares in homer s iliad ares has no fixed allegiance he promises athena and hera that he will fight for the achaeans but aphrodite persuades him to side with the trojans during the war diomedes fights hector and sees ares fighting on the trojans side diomedes calls for his soldiers to withdraw 62 zeus grants athene permission to drive ares from the battlefield encouraged by hera and athena diomedes thrusts with his spear at ares athena drives the spear home and all sides tremble at ares s cries ares flees to mount olympus forcing the trojans to fall back 63 ares overhears that his son ascalaphus has been killed and wants to change sides again rejoining the achaeans for vengeance disregarding zeus s order that no olympian should join the battle athena stops him later when zeus allows the gods to fight in the war again ares attacks athena to avenge his previous injury athena overpowers him by striking him with a boulder 64 attendants deimos terror or dread and phobos fear are ares companions in war 65 and according to hesiod are also his children by aphrodite 66 eris the goddess of discord or enyo the goddess of war bloodshed and violence was

agricultural deity 127 who as a father of romulus rome s legendary founder was given a more important and dignified place in ancient roman religion as a guardian deity of the entire roman state and its people during the hellenization of latin literature the myths of ares were reinterpreted by roman writers under the name of mars greek writers under roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs pertaining to mars under the name of ares thus in the classical tradition of later western art and literature the mythology of the two figures later became virtually indistinguishable 128

acinonyx jubatus is a large cat native to africa and central iran it is the fastest land animal estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km h 50 to 80 mph with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km h 58 and 61 mph and as such has several adaptations for speed including a light build long thin legs and a long tail it typically reaches 67 94 cm 26 37 in at the shoulder and the head and body length is between 1 1 and 1 5 m 3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg 46 and 159 lb its head is small and rounded with a short snout and black tear like facial streaks the coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced solid black spots four subspecies are recognised 3 the cheetah lives in three main social groups females and their cubs male coalitions and solitary males while females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges males are more sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females the cheetah is active during the day with peaks during dawn and dusk it feeds on small to medium sized prey mostly weighing under 40 kg 88 lb and prefers medium sized ungulates such as impala springbok and thomson s gazelles the cheetah typically stalks its prey to within 60 70 m 200 230 ft charges towards it trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death it breeds throughout the year after a gestation of nearly three months a litter of typically three or four cubs is born cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores such as hyenas and lions they are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age the cheetah occurs in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the serengeti arid mountain ranges in the sahara and hilly desert terrain in iran the cheetah is threatened by several factors such as habitat loss conflict with humans poaching and high susceptibility to diseases historically ranging throughout most of sub saharan africa and extending eastward into the middle east and to central india the cheetah is now distributed mainly in small fragmented populations in central iran and southern eastern and northwestern africa in 2016 the global cheetah population was estimated at 7 100 individuals in the wild it is listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list in the past cheetahs were tamed and trained for hunting ungulates they have been widely depicted in art literature advertising and animation contents 1 etymology 2

derived from hindustani urdu چیتا and hindi च त ćītā 4 this in turn comes from sanskrit च त रय chitra ya meaning variegated adorned or painted 5 in the past the cheetah was often called hunting leopard because they could be tamed and used for coursing 6 the generic name acinonyx probably derives from the combination of two greek words ἁκινητος akinitos meaning unmoved or motionless and ὄνυξ onyx meaning nail or hoof 7 a rough translation is immobile nails a reference to the cheetah s limited ability to retract its claws 8 a similar meaning can be obtained by the combination of the greek prefix a implying a lack of and κῑνέω kīnéō meaning to move or to set in motion 9 the specific name jubatus is latin for crested having a mane 10 a few old generic names such as cynailurus and cynofelis allude to the similarities between the cheetah and canids 11 taxonomy an illustration of the woolly cheetah described as felis lanea from the proceedings of the zoological society of london 1877 in 1777 johann christian daniel von schreber described the cheetah based on a skin from the cape of good hope and gave it the scientific name felis jubatus 12 joshua brookes proposed the generic name acinonyx in 1828 13 in 1917 reginald innes pocock placed the cheetah in a subfamily of its own acinonychinae 14 given its striking morphological resemblance to the greyhound and significant deviation from typical felid features the cheetah was classified in felinae in later taxonomic revisions 15 in the 19th and 20th centuries several cheetah specimens were described some were proposed as subspecies an example is the south african specimen known as the woolly cheetah named for its notably dense fur this was described as a new species felis lanea by philip sclater in 1877 16 but the classification was mostly disputed 17 there has been considerable confusion in the nomenclature of cheetahs and leopards panthera pardus as authors often confused the two some considered hunting leopards an independent species or equal to the leopard 18 19 subspecies in 1975 five subspecies were considered valid taxa a j hecki a j jubatus a j raineyi a j soemmeringii and a j venaticus 20 in 2011 a phylogeographic study found minimal genetic variation between a j jubatus and a j raineyi only four subspecies were identified 21 in 2017 the cat classification task force of the iucn cat specialist group revised felid taxonomy and recognised these four subspecies as valid their details are tabulated below 20 22 subspecies details image southeast african cheetah a j jubatus schreber 1775 syn a j raineyi heller 1913 23 the nominate subspecies 22 it genetically diverged from the asiatic cheetah 67 000 32 000 years ago 21 as of 2016 the largest population of nearly 4 000 individuals is sparsely distributed in angola botswana mozambique namibia south africa and zambia 24 asiatic cheetah a j venaticus griffith 1821 25 this subspecies is confined to central iran and is the only surviving cheetah population in asia 26 as of 2022 only 12 individuals were estimated to survive in iran nine of which are males and three of which are females 27 northeast african cheetah a j soemmeringii fitzinger 1855 28 this subspecies occurs in the northern central african republic chad ethiopia and south sudan in small and heavily fragmented populations in 2016 the largest population of 238 individuals occurred in the northern car and southeastern chad it diverged genetically from the southeast african cheetah 72 000 16 000 years ago 21 northwest african cheetah a j hecki hilzheimer 1913 29 this subspecies occurs in algeria benin burkina faso mali and niger 1 in 2016 the largest population of 191 individuals occurred in adrar des ifoghas ahaggar and tassili n ajjer in south central algeria and northeastern mali 26 it is listed as critically endangered on the iucn red list 30 phylogeny and evolution lynx lineage lynx puma lineage acinonyx cheetah puma cougar p concolor herpailurus jaguarundi h yagouaroundi domestic cat lineage felis leopard cat lineage otocolobus prionailurus the puma lineage of the family felidae depicted along with closely related genera 31 the cheetah s closest relatives are the cougar puma concolor and the jaguarundi herpailurus yagouaroundi 20 together these three species form the puma lineage one of the eight lineages of the extant felids the puma lineage diverged from the rest 6 7 mya the sister group of the puma lineage is a clade of smaller old world cats that includes the genera felis otocolobus and prionailurus 31 the oldest cheetah fossils excavated in eastern and southern africa date to 3 5 3 mya the earliest known specimen from south africa is from the lowermost deposits of the silberberg grotto sterkfontein 2 9 though incomplete these fossils indicate forms larger but less cursorial than the modern cheetah 32 fossil remains from europe are limited to a few middle pleistocene specimens from hundsheim austria and mosbach sands germany 33 cheetah like cats are known from as late as 10 000 years ago from the old world the giant cheetah a pardinensis significantly larger and slower compared to the modern cheetah occurred in eurasia and eastern and southern africa in the villafranchian period roughly 3 8 1 9 mya 15 34 in the middle pleistocene a smaller cheetah a intermedius ranged from europe to china 2 the modern cheetah appeared in africa around 1 9 mya its fossil record is restricted to africa 32 extinct north american cheetah like cats had historically been classified in felis puma or acinonyx two such species f studeri and f trumani were considered to be closer to the puma than the cheetah despite their close similarities to the latter noting this palaeontologist daniel adams proposed miracinonyx a new subgenus under acinonyx in 1979 for the north american cheetah like cats 35 this was later elevated to genus rank 36 adams pointed out that north american and old world cheetah like cats may have had a common ancestor and acinonyx might have originated in north america instead of eurasia 35 however subsequent research has shown that miracinonyx is phylogenetically closer to the cougar than the cheetah 37 the similarities to cheetahs have been attributed to convergent evolution 31 the three species of the puma lineage may have had a common ancestor during the miocene roughly 8 25 mya 35 38 some suggest that north american cheetahs possibly migrated to asia via the bering strait then dispersed southward to africa through eurasia at least 100 000 years ago 39 40 41 some authors have expressed doubt over the occurrence of cheetah like cats in north america and instead suppose the modern cheetah to have evolved from asian populations that eventually spread to africa 37 42 the cheetah is thought to have experienced two population bottlenecks that greatly decreased the genetic variability in populations one occurred about 100 000 years ago that has been correlated to migration from north america to asia and the second 10 000 12 000 years ago in africa possibly as part of the late pleistocene extinction event 40 43 44 genetics the diploid number of chromosomes in the cheetah is 38 the same as in most other felids 45 the cheetah was the first felid observed to have unusually low genetic variability among individuals 46 which has led to poor breeding in captivity increased spermatozoal defects high juvenile mortality and increased susceptibility to diseases and infections 47 48 a prominent instance was the deadly feline coronavirus outbreak in a cheetah breeding facility of oregon in 1983 which had a mortality rate of 60 higher than that recorded for previous epizootics of feline infectious peritonitis in any felid 49 the remarkable homogeneity in cheetah genes has been demonstrated by experiments involving the major histocompatibility complex mhc unless the mhc genes are highly homogeneous in a population skin grafts exchanged between a pair of unrelated individuals would be rejected skin grafts exchanged between unrelated cheetahs are accepted well and heal as if their genetic makeup were the same 50 51 the low genetic diversity is thought to have been created by two population bottlenecks from c 100 000 years and c 12 000 years ago respectively the resultant level of genetic variation is around 0 1 4 of average living species lower than that of tasmanian devils virunga gorillas amur tigers and even highly inbred domestic cats and dogs 52 king cheetah king cheetah note the distinctive coat pattern the king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for cream coloured fur marked with large blotchy spots and three dark wide stripes extending from the neck to the tail 53 in manicaland zimbabwe it was known as nsuifisi and thought to be a cross between a leopard and a hyena 54 in 1926 major a cooper wrote about a cheetah like animal he had shot near modern day harare with fur as thick as that of a snow leopard and spots that merged to form stripes he suggested it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah as more such individuals were observed it was seen that they had non retractable claws like the cheetah 55 56 in 1927 pocock described these individuals as a new species by the name of acinonyx rex king cheetah 56 however in the absence of proof to support his claim he withdrew his proposal in 1939 abel chapman considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah 57 since 1927 the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the wild in zimbabwe botswana and northern transvaal one was photographed in 1975 54 in 1981 two female cheetahs that had mated with a wild male from transvaal at the de wildt cheetah and wildlife centre south africa gave birth to one king cheetah each subsequently more king cheetahs were born at the centre 57 in 2012 the cause of this coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase taqpep the same gene responsible for the striped mackerel versus blotchy classic pattern seen in tabby cats 58 the appearance is caused by reinforcement of a recessive allele hence if two mating cheetahs are heterozygous carriers of the mutated allele a quarter of their offspring can be expected to be king cheetahs 59 characteristics cheetah portrait showing black tear marks running from the corners of the eyes down the side of the nose close view of a cheetah note the lightly built slender body spotted coat and long tail the cheetah is a lightly built spotted cat characterised by a small rounded head a short snout black tear like facial streaks a deep chest long thin legs and a long tail its slender canine like form is highly adapted for speed and contrasts sharply with the robust build of the genus panthera 11 60 cheetahs typically reach 67 94 cm 26 37 in at the shoulder and the head and body length is between 1 1 and 1 5 m 3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in 9 61 62 the weight can vary with age health location sex and subspecies adults typically range between 21 and 72 kg 46 and 159 lb cubs born in the wild weigh 150 300 g 5 3 10 6 oz at birth while those born in captivity tend to be larger and weigh around 500 g 18 oz 11 59 61 cheetahs are sexually dimorphic with males larger and heavier than females but not to the extent seen in other large cats 62 63 64 studies differ significantly on morphological variations among the subspecies 64 the coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff darker in the mid back portion 9 61 the chin throat and underparts of the legs and the belly are white and devoid of markings the rest of the body is covered with around 2 000 evenly spaced oval or round solid black spots each measuring roughly 3 5 cm 1 2 2 0 in 59 65 66 each cheetah has a distinct pattern of spots which can be used to identify unique individuals 62 besides the clearly visible spots there are other faint irregular black marks on the coat 65 newly born cubs are covered in fur with an unclear pattern of spots that gives them a dark appearance pale white above and nearly black on the underside 11 the hair is mostly short and often coarse but the chest and the belly are covered in soft fur the fur of king cheetahs has been reported to be silky 9 67 there is a short rough mane covering at least 8 cm 3 1 in along the neck and the shoulders this feature is more prominent in males the mane starts out as a cape of long loose blue to grey hair in juveniles 59 67 melanistic cheetahs are rare and have been seen in zambia and zimbabwe 65 in 1877 1878 sclater described two partially albino specimens from south africa 59 the head is small and more rounded compared to the other big cats 68 saharan cheetahs have canine like slim faces 65 the ears are small short and rounded they are tawny at the base and on the edges and marked with black patches on the back the eyes are set high and have round pupils 62 the whiskers shorter and fewer than those of other felids are fine and inconspicuous 69 the pronounced tear streaks or malar stripes unique to the cheetah originate from the corners of the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth the role of these streaks is not well understood they may protect the eyes from the sun s glare a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day or they could be used to define facial expressions 65 the exceptionally long and muscular tail with a bushy white tuft at the end measures 60 80 cm 24 31 in 70 while the first two thirds of the tail are covered in spots the final third is marked with four to six dark rings or stripes 59 66 the cheetah is superficially similar to the leopard but the leopard has rosettes instead of spots and lacks tear streaks 63 71 moreover the cheetah is slightly taller than the leopard the serval resembles the cheetah in physical build but is significantly smaller has a shorter tail and its spots fuse to form stripes on the back 72 the cheetah appears to have evolved convergently with canids in morphology and behaviour it has canine like features such as a relatively long snout long legs a deep chest tough paw pads and blunt semi retractable claws 73 74 the cheetah has often been likened to the greyhound as both have similar morphology and the ability to reach tremendous speeds in a shorter time than other mammals 67 70 but the cheetah can attain higher maximum speeds 75 internal anatomy the lightly built streamlined agile body of the cheetah makes it an efficient sprinter the blunt claws and the sharp curved dewclaw sharply contrasting with the big cats in its morphology the cheetah shows several adaptations for prolonged chases to catch prey at some of the fastest speeds reached by land animals 76 its light streamlined body makes it well suited to short explosive bursts of speed rapid acceleration and an ability to execute extreme changes in direction while moving at high speed 77 78 79 the large nasal passages accommodated well due to the smaller size of the canine teeth ensure fast flow of sufficient air and the enlarged heart and lungs allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time this allows cheetahs to rapidly regain their stamina after a chase 2 during a typical chase their respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute 80 moreover the reduced viscosity of the blood at higher temperatures common in frequently moving muscles could ease blood flow and increase oxygen transport 81 while running in addition to having good traction due to their semi retractable claws cheetahs use their tail as a rudder like means of steering that enables them to make sharp turns necessary to outflank antelopes which often change direction to escape during a chase 59 68 the protracted claws increase grip over the ground while paw pads make the sprint more convenient over tough ground the limbs of the cheetah are longer than what is typical for other cats its size the thigh muscles are large and the tibia and fibula are held close together making the lower legs less likely to rotate this reduces the risk of losing balance during runs but compromises the ability to climb the highly reduced clavicle is connected through ligaments to the scapula whose pendulum like motion increases the stride length and assists in shock absorption the extension of the vertebral column can add as much as 76 cm 30 in to the stride length 82 83 cheetah skull cheetah skeleton note the deep chest and long limbs the cheetah resembles the smaller cats in cranial features and in having a long and flexible spine as opposed to the stiff and short one in other large felids 2 the roughly triangular skull has light narrow bones and the sagittal crest is poorly developed possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed the mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull 59 63 a study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah s claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs 76 the cheetah has a total of 30 teeth the dental formula is 3 1 3 13 1 2 1 the sharp narrow carnassials are larger than those of leopards and lions suggesting the cheetah can consume larger amount of food in a given time period the small flat canines are used to bite the throat and suffocate the prey a study gave the bite force quotient bfq of the cheetah as 119 close to that for the lion 112 suggesting that adaptations for a lighter skull may not have reduced the power of the cheetah s bite 2 11 unlike other cats the cheetah s canines have no gap behind them when the jaws close as the top and bottom cheek teeth show extensive overlap this equips the upper and lower teeth to effectively tear through the meat the slightly curved claws shorter and straighter than those of other cats lack a protective sheath and are partly retractable 59 62 the claws are blunt due to lack of protection 65 but the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp 84 cheetahs have a high concentration of nerve cells arranged in a band in the centre of the eyes a visual streak the most efficient among felids this significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon 60 85 the cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp edged vocal fold within the larynx 2 86 speed and acceleration documentary video filmed at 1200 frames per second showing the movement of sarah the fastest recorded cheetah over a set run the cheetah is the fastest land animal 87 88 89 90 91 estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km h 50 to 80 mph 59 62 a commonly quoted value is 112 km h 70 mph recorded in 1957 but this measurement is disputed 92 in 2012 an 11 year old cheetah named sarah from the cincinnati zoo set a world record by running 100 m 330 ft in 5 95 seconds over a set run recording a maximum speed of 98 km h 61 mph 93 contrary to the common belief that cheetahs hunt by simply chasing its prey at high speeds the findings of two studies in 2013 observing hunting cheetahs using gps collars show that cheetahs hunt at speeds much lower than the highest recorded for them during most of the chase interspersed with a few short bursts lasting only seconds when they attain peak speeds in one of the studies the average speed recorded during the high speed phase was 53 64 km h 33 3 mph or within the range 41 4 65 88 km h 25 7 40 9 mph including error the highest recorded value was 93 24 km h 57 9 mph the researchers suggested that a hunt consists of two phases an initial fast acceleration phase when the cheetah tries to catch up with the prey followed by slowing down as it closes in on it the deceleration varying by the prey in question the peak acceleration observed was 2 5 m s2 8 2 ft s2 while the peak deceleration value was 7 5 m s2 24 6 ft s2 speed and acceleration values for a hunting cheetah may be different from those for a non hunter because while engaged in the chase the cheetah is more likely to be twisting and turning and may be running through vegetation 94 95 the speeds attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn at 88 5 km h 55 0 mph 96 and the springbok at 88 km h 55 mph 97 but the cheetah additionally has an exceptional acceleration 98 one stride of a galloping cheetah measures 4 to 7 m 13 to 23 ft the stride length and the number of jumps increases with speed 59 during more than half the duration of the sprint the cheetah has all four limbs in the air increasing the stride length 99 running cheetahs can retain up to 90 of the heat generated during the chase a 1973 study suggested the length of the sprint is limited by excessive build up of body heat when the body temperature reaches 40 41 c 104 106 f however a 2013 study recorded the average temperature of cheetahs after hunts to be 38 6 c 101 5 f suggesting high temperatures need not cause hunts to be abandoned 100 101 ecology and behaviour cheetahs are active mainly during the day 67 whereas other carnivores such as leopards and lions are active mainly at night 63 98 these larger carnivores can kill cheetahs and steal their kills 59 hence the diurnal tendency of cheetahs helps them avoid larger predators in areas where they are sympatric such as the okavango delta in areas where the cheetah is the major predator such as farmlands in botswana and namibia activity tends to increase at night this may also happen in highly arid regions such as the sahara where daytime temperatures can reach 43 c 109 f the lunar cycle can also influence the cheetah s routine activity might increase on moonlit nights as prey can be sighted easily though this comes with the danger of encountering larger predators 59 102 hunting is the major activity throughout the day with peaks during dawn and dusk 65 groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk cheetahs often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations to check for prey or larger carnivores even while resting they take turns at keeping a lookout 59 social organisation female with her cubs in phinda private game reservea group of males in maasai mara cheetahs have a flexible and complex social structure and tend to be more gregarious than several other cats except the lion individuals typically avoid one another but are generally amicable males may fight over territories or access to females in oestrus and on rare occasions such fights can result in severe injury and death females are not social and have minimal interaction with other individuals barring the interaction with males when they enter their territories or during the mating season some females generally mother and offspring or siblings may rest beside one another during the day females tend to lead a solitary life or live with offspring in undefended home ranges young females often stay close to their mothers for life but young males leave their mother s range to live elsewhere 59 62 65 some males are territorial and group together for life forming coalitions that collectively defend a territory which ensures maximum access to females this is unlike the behaviour of the male lion who mates with a particular group pride of females in most cases a coalition will consist of brothers born in the same litter who stayed together after weaning but biologically unrelated males are often allowed into the group in the serengeti 30 members in coalitions are unrelated males 65 if a cub is the only male in a litter he will typically join an existing group or form a small group of solitary males with two or three other lone males who may or may not be territorial in the kalahari desert around 40 of the males live in solitude 62 65 males in a coalition are affectionate toward each other grooming mutually and calling out if any member is lost unrelated males may face some aversion in their initial days in the group all males in the coalition typically have equal access to kills when the group hunts together and possibly also to females who may enter their territory 103 a coalition generally has a greater chance of encountering and acquiring females for mating however its large membership demands greater resources than do solitary males 62 65 a 1987 study showed that solitary and grouped males have a nearly equal chance of coming across females but the males in coalitions are notably healthier and have better chances of survival than their solitary counterparts 104 home ranges and territories unlike many other felids among cheetahs females tend to occupy larger areas compared to males 62 females typically disperse over large areas in pursuit of prey but they are less nomadic and roam in a smaller area if prey availability in the area is high as such the size of their home range depends on the distribution of prey in a region in central namibia where most prey species are sparsely distributed home ranges average 554 7 063 km2 214 2 727 sq mi whereas in the woodlands of the phinda game reserve south africa which have plentiful prey home ranges are 34 157 km2 13 61 sq mi in size 65 cheetahs can travel long stretches overland in search of food a study in the kalahari desert recorded an average displacement of nearly 11 km 6 8 mi every day and walking speeds ranged between 2 5 and 3 8 km h 1 6 and 2 4 mph 102 males are generally less nomadic than females often males in coalitions and sometimes solitary males staying far from coalitions establish territories 59 62 whether males settle in territories or disperse over large areas forming home ranges depends primarily on the movements of females territoriality is preferred only if females tend to be more sedentary which is more feasible in areas with plenty of prey some males called floaters switch between territoriality and nomadism depending on the availability of females 65 a 1987 study showed territoriality depended on the size and age of males and the membership of the coalition 104 the ranges of floaters averaged 777 km2 300 sq mi in the serengeti to 1 464 km2 565 sq mi in central namibia in the kruger national park south africa territories were much smaller a coalition of three males occupied a territory measuring 126 km2 49 sq mi and the territory of a solitary male measured 195 km2 75 sq mi 65 when a female enters a territory the males will surround her if she tries to escape the males will bite or snap at her generally the female can not escape on her own the males themselves leave after they lose interest in her they may smell the spot she was sitting or lying on to determine if she was in oestrus 103 communication calls of cheetahs purr hiss growl churr meow chirp howl male marking his territorycheetahs grooming each othermother signalling her cubs by her tail to follow her the cheetah is a vocal felid with a broad repertoire of calls and sounds the acoustic features and the use of many of these have been studied in detail 105 the vocal characteristics such as the way they are produced are often different from those of other cats 106 for instance a study showed that exhalation is louder than inhalation in cheetahs while no such distinction was observed in the domestic cat 107 108 listed below are some commonly recorded vocalisations observed in cheetahs chirping a chirp or a stutter bark is an intense bird like call and lasts less than a second cheetahs chirp when they are excited for instance when gathered around a kill other uses include summoning concealed or lost cubs by the mother or as a greeting or courtship between adults 106 the cheetah s chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion and its churr as the latter s loud roar 105 a similar but louder call yelp can be heard from up to 2 km 1 2 mi away this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings 59 61 churring or churtling a churr is a shrill staccato call that can last up to two seconds churring and chirping have been noted for their similarity to the soft and loud roars of the lion it is produced in similar context as chirping but a study of feeding cheetahs found chirping to be much more common 67 106 purring similar to purring in domestic cats but much louder it is produced when the cheetah is content and as a form of greeting or when licking one another 59 106 it involves continuous sound production alternating between egressive and ingressive airstreams 109 agonistic sounds these include bleating coughing growling hissing meowing and moaning or yowling a bleat indicates distress for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that has stolen its kill growls hisses and moans are accompanied by multiple strong hits on the ground with the front paw during which the cheetah may retreat by a few metres 105 106 110 a meow though a versatile call is typically associated with discomfort or irritation 105 111 other vocalisations individuals can make a gurgling noise as part of a close amicable interaction 59 a nyam nyam sound may be produced while eating apart from chirping mothers can use a repeated ihn ihn is to gather cubs and a prr prr is to guide them on a journey a low pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still bickering cubs can let out a whirr the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel and ends on a harsh note 67 106 another major means of communication is by scent the male will often investigate urine marked places territories or common landmarks for a long time by crouching on his forelegs and carefully smelling the place then he will raise his tail and urinate on an elevated spot such as a tree trunk stump or rock other observing individuals might repeat the ritual females may also show marking behaviour but less prominently than males do among females those in oestrus will show maximum urine marking and their excrement can attract males from far off in botswana cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers to protect livestock by setting up traps in traditional marking spots the calls of the trapped cheetah can attract more cheetahs to the place 67 62 touch and visual cues are other ways of signalling in cheetahs social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the mouth anus and genitals individuals will groom one another lick each other s faces and rub cheeks however they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other the tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range mothers probably use the alternate light and dark rings on the tail to signal their cubs to follow them 67 diet and hunting a cheetah in pursuit of a thomson s gazellea cheetah strangling an impala by a throat bitea group of cheetahs feeding on a killa cheetah feeding at night in skukuza kruger national park south africa the cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small to medium sized prey weighing 20 to 60 kg 44 to 132 lb but mostly less than 40 kg 88 lb its primary prey are medium sized ungulates they are the major component of the diet in certain areas such as dama and dorcas gazelles in the sahara impala in the eastern and southern african woodlands springbok in the arid savannas to the south and thomson s gazelle in the serengeti smaller antelopes like the common duiker are a frequent prey in the southern kalahari larger ungulates are typically avoided though nyala whose males weigh around 120 kg 260 lb were found to be the major prey in a study in the phinda game reserve in namibia cheetahs are the major predators of livestock 9 59 112 the diet of the asiatic cheetah consists of chinkara desert hare goitered gazelle urial wild goats and livestock in india cheetahs used to prey mostly on blackbuck 65 113 there are no records of cheetahs killing humans 65 63 cheetahs in the kalahari have been reported feeding on citron melons for their water content 65 prey preferences and hunting success vary with the age sex and number of cheetahs involved in the hunt and on the vigilance of the prey generally only groups of cheetahs coalitions or mother and cubs will try to kill larger prey mothers with cubs especially look out for larger prey and tend to be more successful than females without cubs individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred 45 59 114 cheetahs hunt primarily throughout the day sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion 65 cheetahs in the sahara and maasai mara in kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day 115 cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches the cheetah will stalk its prey trying to conceal itself in cover and approach as close as possible often within 60 to 70 m 200 to 230 ft of the prey or even farther for less alert prey alternatively the cheetah can lie hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer a stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture with the head lower than the shoulders it will move slowly and be still at times in areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within 200 m 660 ft of the prey and start the chase the chase typically lasts a minute in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged 173 m 568 ft and the longest run measured 559 m 1 834 ft the cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly cheetahs catch their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking some of its limbs 59 67 cheetahs can decelerate dramatically towards the end of the hunt slowing down from 93 km h 58 mph to 23 km h 14 mph in just three strides and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee 65 to kill medium to large sized prey the cheetah bites the prey s throat to suffocate it maintaining the bite for around five minutes within which the prey stops struggling a bite on the nape of the neck or the snout and sometimes on the skull suffices to kill smaller prey 59 67 cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25 40 higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey 65 80 once the hunt is over the prey is taken near a bush or under a tree the cheetah highly exhausted after the chase rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes meanwhile cheetahs nearby who did not take part in the hunt might feed on the kill immediately groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully though minor noises and snapping may be observed 59 cheetahs can consume large quantities of food a cheetah at the etosha national park namibia was found to consume as much as 10 kg 22 lb within two hours 116 however on a daily basis a cheetah feeds on around 4 kg 8 8 lb meat 67 cheetahs especially mothers with cubs remain cautious even as they eat pausing to look around for fresh prey or for predators who may steal the kill 117 cheetahs move their heads from side to side so the sharp carnassial teeth tear the flesh which can then be swallowed without chewing they typically begin with the hindquarters and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine ribs are chewed on at the ends and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating unless the prey is very small the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat cheetahs might lose 10 15 of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions and grey wolves in iran to defend itself or its prey a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground and snarl with its mouth wide open the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward this may be accompanied by moans hisses and growls and hitting the ground with the forepaws 67 cheetahs have rarely been observed scavenging kills this may be due to vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time 59 118 reproduction and life cycle cheetah cub hiding in long grasscub with mothertwo older cubs playing cheetahs are induced ovulators and can breed throughout the year females can have their first litter at two to three years of age polyestrous females have an oestrus heat cycle is 12 days long on average but it can vary from three days to a month a female can conceive again after 17 to 20 months from giving birth or even sooner if a whole litter is lost males can breed at less than two years of age in captivity but this may be delayed in the wild until the male acquires a territory 2 67 103 119 a 2007 study showed that females who gave birth to more litters early in their life often died younger indicating a trade off between longevity and yearly reproductive success 120 urine marking in males can become more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus males sometimes even those in coalitions fight among one another to secure access to the female 121 often one male will eventually win dominance over the others and mate with the female though a female can mate with different males 122 mating begins with the male approaching the female who lies down on the ground individuals often chirp purr or yelp at this time no courtship behaviour is observed the male immediately secures hold of the female s nape and copulation takes place the pair then ignore each other but meet and copulate a few more times three to five times a day for the next two to three days before finally parting ways 2 67 123 after a gestation of nearly three months a litter of one to eight cubs is born though those of three to four cubs are more common births take place at 20 25 minute intervals in a sheltered place such as thick vegetation the eyes are shut at birth and open in four to 11 days newborn cubs might spit a lot and make soft churring noises they start walking by two weeks their nape shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish grey hair called a mantle which gives them a mohawk type appearance this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older 67 15 a study suggested that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of a honey badger and could act as camouflage from attacks by these badgers or predators that tend to avoid them 124 compared to other felids cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to several predators during the first few weeks of their life 125 126 mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first two months and nurse in the early morning the mother is extremely vigilant at this stage she stays within 1 km 0 62 mi of the lair frequently visits her cubs moves them every five to six days and remains with them after dark despite trying to make minimal noise she cannot generally defend her litter from predators predation is the leading cause of mortality in cheetah cubs a study showed that in areas with a low density of predators such as namibian farmlands around 70 of the cubs make it beyond the age of 14 months whereas in areas like the serengeti national park where several large carnivores exist the survival rate was just 17 deaths also occur from starvation if their mothers abandon them fires or pneumonia because of exposure to bad weather 67 103 generation length of the cheetah is six years 127 cubs start coming out of the lair at two months of age trailing after their mother wherever she goes at this point the mother nurses less and brings solid food to the cubs they retreat away from the carcass in fear initially but gradually start eating it the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal weaning occurs at four to six months to train her cubs in hunting the mother will catch and let go of live prey in front of her cubs 103 cubs play behaviour includes chasing crouching pouncing and wrestling there is plenty of agility and attacks are seldom lethal 67 103 playing can improve catching skills in cubs though the ability to crouch and hide may not develop remarkably 128 cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and young gazelles however they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own at around 20 months offspring become independent mothers might have conceived again by then siblings may remain together for a few more months before parting ways while females stay close to their mothers males move farther off 67 103 129 the lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females and their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age males generally live as long as ten years 1 distribution and habitat cheetahs occur in various habitats such as the grasslands of the serengeti cheetahs appear to be less selective in habitat choice than other felids and inhabit a variety of ecosystems areas with greater availability of prey good visibility and minimal chances of encountering larger predators are preferred they seldom occur in tropical forests cheetahs have been reported at elevations as high as 4 000 m 13 000 ft an open area with some cover such as diffused bushes is probably ideal for the cheetah because it needs to stalk and pursue its prey over a distance this also minimises the risk of encountering larger carnivores unlike the big cats the cheetah tends to occur in low densities typically between 0 3 and 3 0 adults per 100 km2 39 sq mi these values are 10 30 of those reported for leopards and lions 1 102 cheetahs in eastern and southern africa occur mostly in savannas like the kalahari and serengeti in central northern and western africa cheetahs inhabit arid mountain ranges and valleys in the harsh climate of the sahara cheetahs prefer high mountains which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert the vegetation and water resources in these mountains supports antelopes iranian cheetahs occur in hilly terrain of deserts at elevations up to 2 000 3 000 m 6 600 9 800 ft where annual precipitation is generally below 100 mm 3 9 in the primary vegetation in these areas is thinly distributed shrubs less than 1 m 3 ft 3 in tall 1 65 102 historical range three of the last wild cheetahs in india were shot in 1947 by maharaja ramanuj pratap singh deo of surguja in prehistoric times the cheetah was distributed throughout africa asia and europe 59 it gradually fell to extinction in europe possibly because of competition with the lion 15 today the cheetah has been extirpated in most of its historical range the numbers of the asiatic cheetah had begun plummeting since the late 1800s long before the other subspecies started their decline as of 2017 cheetahs occur in just nine per cent of their erstwhile range in africa mostly in unprotected areas 26 in the past until the mid 20th century the cheetah ranged across vast stretches in asia from the arabian peninsula in the west to the indian subcontinent in the east and as far north as the aral and caspian seas 130 a few centuries ago the cheetah was abundant in india and its range coincided with the distribution of major prey like the blackbuck 59 however its numbers in india plummeted from the 19th century onward divyabhanusinh of the bombay natural history society notes that the last three individuals in the wild were killed by maharaja ramanuj pratap singh of surguja a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1 360 tigers in 1947 131 132 the last confirmed sighting in india was of a cheetah that drowned in a well near hyderabad in 1957 133 in iran there were around 400 cheetahs before world war ii distributed across deserts and steppes to the east and the borderlands with iraq to the west the numbers were falling because of a decline in prey in iraq cheetahs were reported from basra in the 1920s conservation efforts in the 1950s stabilised the population but prey species declined again in the wake of the iranian revolution 1979 and the iran iraq war 1980 1988 leading to a significant contraction of the cheetah s historical range in the region 26 134 the first survey of cheetah populations in africa by norman myers in 1975 estimated a population of 15 000 individuals throughout sub saharan africa the range covered most of eastern and southern africa except for the desert region on the western coast of modern day angola and namibia 135 in the following years as their natural habitat has been modified dramatically cheetah populations across the region have become smaller and more fragmented 136 present distribution the cheetah occurs mostly in eastern and southern africa its presence in asia is limited to the central deserts of iran though there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings in afghanistan iraq and pakistan in the last few decades 1 26 the global population of cheetahs was estimated at nearly 7 100 mature individuals in 2016 the iranian population appears to have decreased from 60 to 100 individuals in 2007 to 43 in 2016 distributed in three subpopulations over less than 150 000 km2 58 000 sq mi in iran s central plateau 24 137 the largest population of nearly 4 000 individuals is sparsely distributed over angola botswana mozambique namibia south africa and zambia another population in kenya and tanzania comprises about 1 000 individuals all other cheetahs occur in small fragmented groups of less than 100 individuals each populations are feared to be declining 24 threats the cheetah is threatened by several factors like habitat loss and fragmentation of populations habitat loss is caused mainly by the introduction of commercial land use such as agriculture and industry 1 it is further aggravated by ecological degradation like bush encroachment which is common in southern africa 138 139 140 moreover the species apparently requires a sizeable area to live in as indicated by its low population densities shortage of prey and conflict with other species such as humans and large carnivores are other major threats 1 141 the cheetah appears to be less capable of coexisting with humans than the leopard 142 with 76 of its range consisting of unprotected land the cheetah is often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock especially in namibia 143 illegal wildlife trade and trafficking is another problem in some places like ethiopia some tribes like the maasai people in tanzania have been reported to use cheetah skins in ceremonies 6 32 roadkill is another threat especially in areas where roads have been constructed near natural habitat or protected areas cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from kalmand touran national park and bafq in iran 1 the reduced genetic variability makes cheetahs more vulnerable to diseases 48 however the threat posed by infectious diseases may be minor given the low population densities and hence a reduced chance of infection 1 conservation the cheetah has been classified as vulnerable by the iucn it is listed under appendix i of the cms and appendix i of cites 1 the endangered species act enlists the cheetah as endangered 144 in africa the cheetah conservation fund s field and research centre in otjiwarongo namibia until the 1970s cheetahs and other carnivores were frequently killed to protect livestock in africa gradually the understanding of cheetah ecology increased and their falling numbers became a matter of concern the de wildt cheetah and wildlife centre was set up in 1971 in south africa to provide care for wild cheetahs regularly trapped or injured by namibian farmers 6 by 1987 the first major research project to outline cheetah conservation strategies was underway 145 the cheetah conservation fund founded in 1990 in namibia put efforts into field research and education about cheetahs on the global platform 6 the ccf runs a cheetah genetics laboratory the only one of its kind in otjiwarongo namibia 146 bushblok is an initiative to restore habitat systematically through targeted bush thinning and biomass utilisation 139 147 several more cheetah specific conservation programmes have since been established like cheetah outreach in south africa 6 the global cheetah action plan workshop in 2002 laid emphasis on the need for a rangewide survey of wild cheetahs to demarcate areas for conservation efforts and on creating awareness through training programs 148 the range wide conservation program for cheetah and african wild dogs rwcp began in 2007 as a joint initiative of the iucn cat and canid specialist groups the wildlife conservation society and the zoological society of london national conservation plans have been developed successfully for several african countries 149 150 in 2014 the cites standing committee recognised the cheetah as a species of priority in their strategies in northeastern africa to counter wildlife trafficking 151 in december 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as endangered on the iucn red list 24 the cheetah was reintroduced in malawi in 2017 152 in asia see also cheetah reintroduction in india jairam ramesh at the cheetah outreach centre near cape town in 2010 during his visit to discuss cheetah translocation from south africa to india in 2001 the iranian government collaborated with the ccf the iucn panthera corporation undp and the wildlife conservation society on the conservation of asiatic cheetah project cacp to protect the natural habitat of the asiatic cheetah and its prey 153 154 in 2004 the iranian centre for sustainable development cenesta conducted an international workshop to discuss conservation plans with local stakeholders 6 iran declared 31 august as national cheetah day in 2006 155 the iranian cheetah strategic planning meet in 2010 formulated a five year conservation plan for asiatic cheetahs 6 the cacp phase ii was implemented in 2009 and the third phase was drafted in 2018 156 during the early 2000s scientists from the centre for cellular and molecular biology hyderabad proposed a plan to clone asiatic cheetahs from iran for reintroduction in india but iran denied the proposal 157 in september 2009 the minister of environment and forests assigned the wildlife trust of india and the wildlife institute of india with examining the potential of importing african cheetahs to india 158 kuno wildlife sanctuary and nauradehi wildlife sanctuary were suggested as reintroduction sites for the cheetah because of their high prey density 159 however plans for reintroduction were stalled in may 2012 by the supreme court of india because of a political dispute and concerns over introducing a non native species to the country opponents stated the plan was not a case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of its native range 160 161 on 28 january 2020 the supreme court allowed the central government to introduce cheetahs to a suitable habitat in india on an experimental basis to see if they can adapt to it 162 163 in july 2022 it was announced that eight cheetahs would be transferred from namibia to india in august 164 in 2020 india signed a memorandum of understanding with namibia as part of project cheetah eight cheetahs have been donated by namibia that will be introduced to the kuno national park 165 interaction with humans taming the cheetah shows little aggression toward humans and can be tamed easily as it has been since antiquity 15 the earliest known depictions of the cheetah are from the chauvet cave in france dating back to 32 000 26 000 bc 166 according to historians such as heinz friederichs and burchard brentjes the cheetah was first tamed in sumer and this gradually spread out to central and northern africa from where it reached india the evidence for this is mainly pictorial for instance a sumerian seal dating back to c 3000 bc featuring a long legged leashed animal has fueled speculation that the cheetah was first tamed in sumer however thomas allsen argues that the depicted animal might be a large dog 167 other historians such as frederick zeuner have opined that ancient egyptians were the first to tame the cheetah from where it gradually spread into central asia iran and india 168 in comparison theories of the cheetah s taming in egypt are stronger and include timelines proposed on this basis 168 mafdet one of the ancient egyptian deities worshiped during the first dynasty 3100 2900 bc was sometimes depicted as a cheetah ancient egyptians believed the spirits of deceased pharaohs were taken away by cheetahs 166 reliefs in the deir el bahari temple complex tell of an expedition by egyptians to the land of punt during the reign of hatshepsut 1507 1458 bc that fetched among other things animals called panthers during the new kingdom 16th to 11th centuries bc cheetahs were common pets for royalty who adorned them with ornate collars and leashes 168 the egyptians would use their dogs to bring the concealed prey out in the open after which a cheetah would be set upon it to kill it rock carvings depicting cheetahs dating back to 2000 6000 years ago have been found in twyfelfontein little else has been discovered in connection to the taming of cheetahs or other cats in southern africa 166 hunting cheetahs are known in pre islamic arabic art from yemen 169 hunting with cheetahs became more prevalent toward the seventh century ad in the middle east the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in a special seat on the back of the saddle taming was an elaborate process and could take a year to complete 166 the romans may have referred to the cheetah as the leopardos λεοπάρδος or leontopardos λεοντόπαρδος believing it to be a hybrid between a leopard and a lion because of the mantle seen in cheetah cubs and the difficulty of breeding them in captivity 170 a roman hunting cheetah is depicted in a 4th century mosaic from lod israel 171 cheetahs continued to be used into the byzantine period of the roman empire with hunting leopards being mentioned in the cynegetica 283 284 ad 170 172 173 in eastern asia records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably the earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern asia dates back to the tang dynasty 7th to 10th centuries ad paintings depict tethered cheetahs and cheetahs mounted on horses chinese emperors would use cheetahs and caracals as gifts in the 13th and the 14th centuries the yuan rulers bought numerous cheetahs from the western parts of the empire and from muslim merchants according to the ming shilu the subsequent ming dynasty 14th to 17th centuries continued this practice 168 tomb figurines from the mongol empire dating back to the reign of kublai khan 1260 1294 ad represent cheetahs on horseback 166 the mughal ruler akbar the great 1556 1605 ad is said to have kept as many as 1000 khasa imperial cheetahs 80 166 his son jahangir wrote in his memoirs tuzk e jahangiri that only one of them gave birth 168 mughal rulers trained cheetahs and caracals in a similar way as the western asians and used them to hunt game especially blackbuck the rampant hunting severely affected the populations of wild animals in india by 1927 cheetahs had to be imported from africa 166 a hieroglyph from deir el bahari depicting leashed cheetahs panthers sketch of cheetahs belonging to the nawab of oudh with attendants 1844 in captivity a cheetah in the st louis zoo the first cheetah to be brought into captivity in a zoo was at the zoological society of london in 1829 early captive cheetahs showed a high mortality rate with an average lifespan of 3 4 years after trade of wild cheetahs was delimited by the enforcement of cites in 1975 more efforts were put into breeding in captivity in 2014 the number of captive cheetahs worldwide was estimated at 1730 individuals with 87 born in captivity 6 174 mortality under captivity is generally high in 2014 23 of the captive cheetahs worldwide died under one year of age mostly within a month of birth 174 deaths result from several reasons stillbirths birth defects cannibalism hypothermia maternal neglect and infectious diseases 175 compared to other felids cheetahs need specialised care because of their higher vulnerability to stress induced diseases this has been attributed to their low genetic variability and factors of captive life 176 common diseases of cheetahs include feline herpesvirus feline infectious peritonitis gastroenteritis glomerulosclerosis leukoencephalopathy myelopathy nephrosclerosis and veno occlusive disease 176 177 high density of cheetahs in a place closeness to other large carnivores in enclosures improper handling exposure to public and frequent movement between zoos can be sources of stress for cheetahs recommended management practices for cheetahs include spacious and ample access to outdoors stress minimisation by exercise and limited handling and following proper hand rearing protocols especially for pregnant females 178 wild cheetahs are far more successful breeders than captive cheetahs 179 this has also been linked to increased stress levels in captive individuals 176 in a study in the serengeti females were found to have a 95 success rate in breeding compared to 20 recorded for north american captive cheetahs in another study 119 180 on 26 november 2017 a female cheetah gave birth to eight cubs in the saint louis zoo setting a record for the most births recorded by the association of zoos and aquariums 181 chances of successful mating in captive males can be improved by replicating social groups such as coalitions observed in the wild 182 in culture bacchus and ariadne by titian 1523 the cheetah has been widely portrayed in a variety of artistic works in bacchus and ariadne an oil painting by the 16th century italian painter titian the chariot of the greek god dionysus bacchus is depicted as being drawn by two cheetahs the cheetahs in the painting were previously considered to be leopards 183 in 1764 english painter george stubbs commemorated the gifting of a cheetah to george iii by the english governor of madras sir george pigot in his painting cheetah with two indian attendants and a stag the painting depicts a cheetah hooded and collared by two indian servants along with a stag it was supposed to prey upon 184 the 1896 painting the caress by the 19th century belgian symbolist painter fernand khnopff is a representation of the myth of oedipus and the sphinx and portrays a creature with a woman s head and a cheetah s body 185 the caress by fernand khnopff 1896 two cheetahs are depicted standing upright and supporting a crown in the coat of arms of the free state south africa 186 in 1969 joy adamson of born free fame wrote the spotted sphinx a biography of her pet cheetah pippa 187 hussein an entertainment a novel by patrick o brian set in the british raj period in india illustrates the practice of royalty keeping and training cheetahs to hunt antelopes 188 the book how it was with dooms tells the true story of a family raising an orphaned cheetah cub named dooms in kenya the 2005 film duma was based loosely on this book 189 the animated series thundercats had a character named cheetara an anthropomorphic cheetah voiced by lynne lipton 190 comic book heroine wonder woman s chief adversary is barbara ann minerva alias the cheetah 191 the bill thomas cheetah american racing car a chevrolet based coupe first designed and driven in 1963 was an attempt to challenge carroll shelby s shelby cobra in american sports car competition of the 1960s because only two dozen or fewer chassis were built with only a dozen complete cars the cheetah was never homologated for competition beyond prototype status its production ended in 1966 192 in 1986 frito lay introduced chester

tornado terms tropical cyclone terms weather portalvte in meteorology a cyclone ˈsaɪ kloʊn is a large air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere as viewed from above opposite to an anticyclone 1 2 cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure 3 4 the largest low pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale the synoptic scale warm core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale 5 mesocyclones tornadoes and dust devils lie within smaller mesoscale 6 upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the northern hemisphere cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets such as mars jupiter and neptune 7 8 cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification 9 extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones these zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies later in their life cycle extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems a cyclone s track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream weather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different temperature humidity and densities and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center tropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity and are warm core 10 11 cyclones can transition between extratropical subtropical and tropical phases 12 mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land and can lead to tornado formation 13 waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear 14 in the atlantic and the northeastern pacific oceans a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane from the name of the ancient central american deity of wind huracan in the indian and south pacific oceans it is called a cyclone and in the northwestern pacific it is called a typhoon 15 the growth of instability in the vortices is not universal for example the size intensity moist convection surface evaporation the value of potential temperature at each potential height can affect the nonlinear evolution of a vortex 16 17 contents 1 nomenclature 2 structure 3 formation 4 synoptic scale 4 1

calcutta between 1836 and 1855 in the journal of the asiatic society he also coined the term cyclone meaning the coil of a snake in 1842 he published his landmark thesis laws of the storms 18 structure comparison between extratropical and tropical cyclones on surface analysis there are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones a cyclone is a low pressure area 19 a cyclone s center often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the eye is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region 19 near the center the pressure gradient force from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone and the force from the coriolis effect must be in an approximate balance or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure 20 because of the coriolis effect the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere 21 in the northern hemisphere the fastest winds relative to the surface of the earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward moving one the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere 22 in contrast to low pressure systems the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise anticyclonic in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere formation the initial extratropical low pressure area forms at the location of the red dot on the image it is usually perpendicular at a right angle to the leaf like cloud formation seen on satellite during the early stage of cyclogenesis the location of the axis of the upper level jet stream is in light blue tropical cyclones form when the energy released by the condensation of moisture in rising air causes a positive feedback loop over warm ocean waters 23 main articles cyclogenesis and tropical cyclogenesis cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere 9 cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in the development of some sort of cyclone 24 it can occur at various scales from the microscale to the synoptic scale extratropical cyclones begin as waves along weather fronts before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core systems however some intense extratropical cyclones can become warm core systems when a warm seclusion occurs tropical cyclones form as a result of significant convective activity and are warm core 11 mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land and can lead to tornado formation 13 waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear 14 cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis and is the high pressure system equivalent which deals with the formation of high pressure areas anticyclogenesis 25 a surface low can form in a variety of ways topography can create a surface low mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows that are initially warm core 26 the disturbance can grow into a wave like formation along the front and the low is positioned at the crest around the low the flow becomes cyclonic this rotational flow moves polar air towards the equator on the west side of the low while warm air move towards the pole on the east side a cold front appears on the west side while a warm front forms on the east side usually the cold front moves at a quicker pace than the warm front and catches up with it due to the slow erosion of higher density air mass out ahead of the cyclone in addition the higher density air mass sweeping in behind the cyclone strengthens the higher pressure denser cold air mass the cold front over takes the warm front and reduces the length of the warm front 27 at this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft which is also known as a trowal 28 tropical cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of a tropical cyclone 29 the mechanisms by which tropical cyclogenesis occurs are distinctly different from those that produce mid latitude cyclones tropical cyclogenesis the development of a warm core cyclone begins with significant convection in a favorable atmospheric environment there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures 30 atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a preexisting low level focus or disturbance low vertical wind shear 31 an average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide 32 with 47 reaching hurricane typhoon strength and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones at least category 3 intensity on the saffir simpson hurricane scale 33 synoptic scale a fictitious synoptic chart of an extratropical cyclone affecting the uk and ireland the blue arrows between isobars indicate the direction of the wind while the l symbol denotes the centre of the low note the occluded cold and warm frontal boundaries the following types of cyclones are identifiable in synoptic charts surface based types see also low pressure area there are three main types of surface based cyclones extratropical cyclones subtropical cyclones and tropical cyclones extratropical cyclone main article extratropical cyclone an extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low pressure weather system that does not have tropical characteristics 34 as it is connected with fronts and horizontal gradients rather than vertical in temperature and dew point otherwise known as baroclinic zones 35 extratropical is applied to cyclones outside the tropics in the middle latitudes these systems may also be described as mid latitude cyclones due to their area of formation or post tropical cyclones when a tropical cyclone has moved extratropical transition beyond the tropics 35 36 they are often described as depressions or lows by weather forecasters and the general public these are the everyday phenomena that along with anticyclones drive weather over much of the earth although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius 37 an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm and from there into a tropical cyclone if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core and as a result develops central convection 38 a particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor easter polar low main article polar low a polar low over the sea of japan in december 2009 a polar low is a small scale short lived atmospheric low pressure system depression that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the northern and southern hemispheres polar lows were first identified on the meteorological satellite imagery that became available in the 1960s which revealed many small scale cloud vortices at high latitudes the most active polar lows are found over certain ice free maritime areas in or near the arctic during the winter such as the norwegian sea barents sea labrador sea and gulf of alaska polar lows dissipate rapidly when they make landfall antarctic systems tend to be weaker than their northern counterparts since the air sea temperature differences around the continent are generally smaller citation needed however vigorous polar lows can be found over the southern ocean during winter when cold core lows with temperatures in the mid levels of the troposphere reach 45 c 49 f move over open waters deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible 39 the systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than 1 000 kilometres 620 mi and exist for no more than a couple of days they are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high latitude operations such as shipping and gas and oil platforms polar lows have been referred to by many other terms such as polar mesoscale vortex arctic hurricane arctic low and cold air depression today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near surface winds of at least 17 m s 40 subtropical subtropical storm alex in the north atlantic ocean in january 2016 main article subtropical cyclone a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone they can form between the equator and the 50th parallel 41 as early as the 1950s meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones and used terms such as quasi tropical and semi tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids 42 by 1972 the national hurricane center officially recognized this cyclone category 43 subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the atlantic basin in 2002 41 they have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient 41 since they form from extratropical cyclones which have colder temperatures aloft than normally found in the tropics the sea surface temperatures required is around 23 degrees celsius 73 f for their formation which is three degrees celsius 5 f lower than for tropical cyclones 44 this means that subtropical cyclones are more likely to form outside the traditional bounds of the hurricane season although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane force winds they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm 45 tropical main article tropical cyclone 2017 atlantic hurricane season summary map a tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a low pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain 46 a tropical cyclone feeds on heat released when moist air rises resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air 46 they are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor easters european windstorms and polar lows leading to their classification as warm core storm systems 46 11 hurricane catarina a rare south atlantic tropical cyclone viewed from the international space station on march 26 2004 the term tropical refers to both the geographic origin of these systems which form almost exclusively in tropical regions of the globe 47 and their dependence on maritime tropical air masses for their formation the term cyclone refers to the storms cyclonic nature with counterclockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere 47 depending on their location and strength tropical cyclones are referred to by other names such as hurricane typhoon tropical storm cyclonic storm tropical depression or simply as a cyclone 47 while tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain they are also able to produce high waves and a damaging storm surge 48 their winds increase the wave size and in so doing they draw more heat and moisture into their system thereby increasing their strength they develop over large bodies of warm water 49 and hence lose their strength if they move over land 50 this is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from strong winds 47 heavy rains however can produce significant flooding inland 47 storm surges are rises in sea level caused by the reduced pressure of the core that in effect sucks the water upward and from winds that in effect pile the water up storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40 kilometres 25 mi from the coastline 47 although their effects on human populations can be devastating tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions 51 they also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes 47 which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism as a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the earth s troposphere 47 many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable 47 others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere if the conditions remain favorable the tropical disturbance intensifies and can even develop an eye on the other end of the spectrum if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall the system weakens and eventually dissipates a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses 11 a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition 52 atlantic hurricane pacific hurricane pacific typhoon north indian ocean cyclone south pacific cyclone australian region cyclone south west indian ocean cyclone upper level types polar cyclone main article polar cyclone a polar sub polar or arctic cyclone also known as a polar vortex 53 is a vast area of low pressure that strengthens in the winter and weakens in the summer 54 a polar cyclone is a low pressure weather system usually spanning 1 000 kilometres 620 mi to 2 000 kilometres 1 200 mi 55 in which the air circulates in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the southern hemisphere the coriolis acceleration acting on the air masses moving poleward at high altitude causes a counterclockwise circulation at high altitude the poleward movement of air originates from the air circulation of the polar cell the polar low is not driven by convection as are tropical cyclones nor the cold and warm air mass interactions as are extratropical cyclones but is an artifact of the global air movement of the polar cell the base of the polar low is in the mid to upper troposphere in the northern hemisphere the polar cyclone has two centers on average one center lies near baffin island and the other over northeast siberia 53 in the southern hemisphere it tends to be located near the edge of the ross ice shelf near 160 west longitude 56 when the polar vortex is strong its effect can be felt at the surface as a westerly wind toward the east when the polar cyclone is weak significant cold outbreaks occur 57 tutt cell main article upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex under specific circumstances upper level cold lows can break off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough tutt which is located mid ocean in the northern hemisphere during the summer months these upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices also known as tutt cells or tutt lows usually move slowly from east northeast to west southwest and their bases generally do not extend below 20 000 feet 6 100 m in altitude a weak inverted surface trough within the trade wind is generally found underneath them and they may also be associated with broad areas of high level clouds downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of a surface vortex in rare cases they become warm core tropical cyclones upper cyclones and the upper troughs that trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance cyclone 58 59 mesoscale the following types of cyclones are not identifiable in synoptic charts mesocyclone main article mesocyclone a mesocyclone is a vortex of air 2 0 kilometres 1 2 mi to 10 kilometres 6 2 mi in diameter the mesoscale of meteorology within a convective storm 60 air rises and rotates around a vertical axis usually in the same direction as low pressure systems 61 in both northern and southern hemisphere they are most often cyclonic that is associated with a localized low pressure region within a supercell 61 62 such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail 61 mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells where tornadoes may form 61 about 1 700 mesocyclones form annually across the united states but only half produce tornadoes 13 tornado main article tornado a tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or 63 in rare cases the base of a cumulus cloud also referred to as twisters a colloquial term in america or cyclones although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a wider sense to name any closed low pressure circulation dust devil main article dust devil a dust devil is a strong well formed and relatively long lived whirlwind 64 ranging from small half a metre wide and a few metres tall to large more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall 64 the primary vertical motion is upward 64 dust devils are usually harmless but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose a threat to both people and property 64 waterspout main article waterspout a waterspout is a columnar vortex forming over water that is in its most common form a non supercell tornado over water that is connected to a cumuliform cloud while it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur steam devil main article steam devil a gentle vortex over calm water or wet land made visible by rising water vapour fire whirl main article fire whirl a fire whirl also colloquially known as a fire devil fire tornado firenado or fire twister is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash other planets main article extraterrestrial vortex cyclone on mars imaged by the hubble space telescope cyclones are not unique to earth cyclonic storms are common on jovian planets such as the small dark spot on neptune 65 it is about one third the diameter of the great dark spot and received the nickname wizard s eye because it looks like an eye this appearance is caused by a white cloud in the middle of the wizard s eye 8 mars has also exhibited cyclonic storms 7 jovian storms like the great red spot are usually mistakenly named as giant hurricanes or cyclonic storms however this is inaccurate as the great red spot is in fact the inverse phenomenon an anticyclone 66 see also weather portal tropical cyclones portal tornadoes portal

during the power of shazam ongoing series first year of publication as a villain towards the end of the series run adam returns and announces that black adam and theo adam are separate personalities black adam stands trial again for the murders of the batsons and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of theo adam the reformed black adam is still vulnerable to his murderous host s influence and he attacks the justice society of america under theo adam s control in jsa 6 1999 in subsequent issues adam joins supervillain johnny sorrow s injustice society after sorrow removes a malignant tumor from adam s brain he is sent to battle wildcat and easily defeats him showing how easily he could kill him by taking him about 25 000 feet above the ground just high enough for them to talk while unable to go any higher without the human wildcat freezing or suffocating explaining the different ways he could kill him and asking what he will give for his life he shows him the rock of eternity where sorrow has turned shazam to stone with his cursed face that usually kills those that see him also making contact with the spectre who provides them with additional information adam soon betrays sorrow and he and the jsa defeat the injustice society black adam briefly gives flash the speed of heru enabling him to defeat johnny sorrow by hitting him at

thanagarian demon claiming to be free of theo s evil influence again a repentant black adam requests membership in the justice society and is granted a probationary membership in jsa 21 2002 during their tenure on jsa writers geoff johns and david s goyer redefined adam s personality and background focusing on the character s old fashioned and militant ideals of justice and his officious and strongly opinionated attitude despite this he has stated on many occasions that he respects the justice society particularly members such as jay garrick several other jsa members are shown to be skeptical of adam s reformation primary among them is the atom smasher who later becomes adam s close friend after adam sympathizes with his decision to kill the near immortal extant to save his mother the writers also created added tension in the book by having captain marvel who is wholly unconvinced that adam has reformed join the team one jsa story arc issues 39 through 44 features marvel hawkgirl and mr terrific venturing back in time to ancient egypt where they meet the mighty adam before his corruption during this visit the mighty adam is grateful to meet captain marvel since marvel s presence demonstrates that his legacy will survive him even with his children gone when marvel transforms back into billy batson adam expresses admiration for the young man s ability to handle the power of shazam at such a young age something he doubts he could have achieved himself after returning to the present marvel notes that he has a better understanding of adam s motives now after learning about the loss of adam s family adam rebuffs the offer commenting that marvel cannot truly understand him stating that while they are not enemies they will never be friends johns and goyer used this story arc to slightly alter adam s origin the hero now hails from the fictional north african nation of kahndaq not egypt although he serves the egyptian prince khufu who is later reincarnated as jsa member hawkman the character of blaze is completely removed from the origin story and adam s rage is described as having resulted from the conquering of kahndaq and the murder of his wife and children at the hands of a magically powered supervillain named ahk ton whose powers resemble the future hero metamorpho who is working with the notorious immortal vandal savage citation needed the mighty adam kills ahk ton during the struggle and returns to kahndaq to reclaim it by any means necessary including murder the wizard shazam does not agree with adam s actions and robs adam of his powers and kills him jsa black reign edit in jsa 45 2003 black adam and his teammate the atom smasher both defect from the justice society expressing dissatisfaction with the team s refusal to cross certain lines during the next few issues adam forms his own organization which administers justice the way adam wants it an eye for an eye his roster includes a mix of dc heroes and villains including the atom smasher brainwave who is possessed by mister mind northwind and the rest of the society of feithera nemesis and former jsa museum curator alex montez the human host of the demon eclipso adam s collective executes kobra a villain who has been acquitted by the legal system albeit because his followers had threatened to blow themselves up if he was not released when the jsa could have spared them his escape and the hassle of a trial by simply killing kobra when he was first captured adam then turns his attentions to his old homeland of kahndaq now ruled by a militant dictator whose actions had long been ignored by the united nations late 2003 began the publication of a jsa hawkman crossover story arc titled black reign written by geoff johns alone which features adam and his militia s hostile takeover of kahndaq a war soon breaks out with adam his comrades and the kahndaqi people on one side and the justice society on the other the dictator is finally killed by atom smasher by the end of the arc the jsa leaves adam in control of kahndaq provided that he does not leave its borders convincing him that he cannot enforce his rule on the world or he is no better than the dictator he had defeated 7 brainwave is saved by the jsa mister mind is apprehended thanks to the atom infiltrating brainwave s head as part of an undercover mission to confirm whether adam was brainwashing his comrades and nemesis and alex both die during the battle when alex loses control of eclipso only northwind and the atom smasher remain at adam s side with the atom smasher later leaving when a time travelling clash with degaton results in him meeting al pratt in the 1950s and re evaluating his past motivations 7 as kahndaq s ruler adam is depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation although his arrogance is still a handicap when the spectre attacked kahndaq after being corrupted by eclipso black adam actually told his people that the jsa were also their enemy because he did not want to give his people the impression that he needed help to protect them despite the fact that he was clearly outmatched by the spectre s power 7 infinite crisis edit black adam is featured heavily in dc s 2005 infinite crisis crossover primarily in the villains united miniseries as a member of the secret society of super villains which he only joins to

powers of the psycho pirate luthor is able to control adam and have him call down the shazam magic lightning bolt to fuel the apparatus the spectre s rampage during the day of vengeance storyline has reverted all magic in the dc universe to a raw chaotic structure and the death of the wizard shazam has transformed him into a tether that can be used to harness magic allowing alexander to use any

throughout the greco roman world isis was first mentioned in the old kingdom c 2686 c 2181 bce as one of the main characters of the osiris myth in which she resurrects her slain brother and husband the divine king osiris and produces and protects his heir horus she was believed to help the dead enter the afterlife as she had helped osiris and she was considered the divine mother of the pharaoh who was likened to horus her maternal aid was invoked in healing spells to benefit ordinary people originally she played a limited role in royal rituals and temple rites although she was more prominent in funerary practices and magical texts she was usually portrayed in art as a human woman wearing a throne like hieroglyph on her head during the new kingdom c 1550 c 1070 bce as she took on traits that originally belonged to hathor the preeminent goddess of earlier times isis was portrayed wearing hathor s headdress a sun disk between the horns of a cow in the first millennium bce osiris and isis became the most widely worshipped egyptian deities and isis absorbed traits from many other goddesses rulers in egypt and its neighbor to the south nubia built temples dedicated primarily to isis and her temple at philae was a religious center for egyptians and nubians alike her reputed magical power was greater than that of all other gods and she was said to protect the kingdom from its enemies govern the skies and the natural world and have power over fate itself in the hellenistic period 323 30 bce when egypt was ruled and settled by greeks isis was worshipped by greeks and egyptians along with a new god serapis their worship diffused into the wider mediterranean world isis s greek devotees ascribed to her traits taken from greek deities such as the invention of marriage and the protection of ships at sea and she retained strong links with egypt and other egyptian deities who were popular in the hellenistic world such as osiris and harpocrates as hellenistic culture was absorbed by rome in the first century bce the cult of isis became a part of roman religion her devotees were a small proportion of the roman empire s population but were found all across its territory her following developed distinctive festivals such as the navigium isidis as well as initiation ceremonies resembling those of other greco roman mystery cults some of her devotees said she encompassed all feminine divine powers in the world the worship of isis was ended by the rise of christianity in the fourth through sixth centuries ce her worship may have influenced christian beliefs and practices such as the veneration of mary but the evidence for this influence is ambiguous and often controversial isis continues to appear in western culture particularly in esotericism and modern paganism often as a personification of nature or the feminine aspect of divinity contents 1 in egypt and nubia 1 1 name and origins 1 2 roles 1 2 1 wife and mourner 1 2 2 mother goddess 1 2 3 goddess

osiris were mentioned by name before the fifth dynasty c 2494 2345 bce 5 6 an inscription that may refer to isis dates to the reign of nyuserre ini during that period 7 and she appears prominently in the pyramid texts which began to be written down at the end of the dynasty and whose content may have developed much earlier 8 several passages in the pyramid texts link isis with the region of the nile delta near behbeit el hagar and sebennytos and her cult may have originated there 9 note 1 many scholars have focused on isis s name in trying to determine her origins her egyptian name was ꜣst which became ⲏⲥⲉ ēse in the coptic form of egyptian wusa in the meroitic language of nubia and ἶσις on which her modern name is based in greek 14 note 2 the hieroglyphic writing of her name incorporates the sign for a throne which isis also wears on her head as a sign of her identity the symbol serves as a phonogram spelling the st sounds in her name but it may have also represented a link with actual thrones the egyptian term for a throne was also st and may have shared a common etymology with isis s name therefore the egyptologist kurt sethe suggested she was originally a personification of thrones 15 henri frankfort agreed believing that the throne was considered the king s mother and thus a goddess because of its power to make a man into a king 16 other scholars such as jürgen osing and klaus p kuhlmann have disputed this interpretation because of dissimilarities between isis s name and the word for a throne 15 or a lack of evidence that the throne was ever deified 17 roles the cycle of myth surrounding osiris s death and resurrection was first recorded in the pyramid texts and grew into the most elaborate and influential of all egyptian myths 18 isis plays a more active role in this myth than the other protagonists so as it developed in literature from the new kingdom c 1550 1070 bce to the ptolemaic period 305 30 bce she became the most complex literary character of all egyptian deities 19 at the same time she absorbed characteristics from many other goddesses broadening her significance well beyond the osiris myth 20 wife and mourner sculpture of a woman possibly isis in a pose of mourning fifteenth or fourteenth century bce isis is part of the ennead of heliopolis a family of nine deities descended from the creator god atum or ra she and her siblings osiris set and nephthys are the last generation of the ennead born to geb god of the earth and nut goddess of the sky the creator god the world s original ruler passes down his authority through the male generations of the ennead so that osiris becomes king isis who is osiris s wife as well as his sister is his queen 21 set kills osiris and in several versions of the story dismembers his corpse isis and nephthys along with other deities such as anubis search for the pieces of their brother s body and reassemble it their efforts are the mythic prototype for mummification and other ancient egyptian funerary practices 22 according to some texts they must also protect osiris s body from further desecration by set or his servants 23 isis is the epitome of a mourning widow her and nephthys s love and grief for their brother help restore him to life as does isis s recitation of magical spells 24 funerary texts contain speeches by isis in which she expresses her sorrow at osiris s death her sexual desire for him and even anger that he has left her all these emotions play a part in his revival as they are meant to stir him into action 25 finally isis restores breath and life to osiris s body and copulates with him conceiving their son horus 22 after this point osiris lives on only in the duat or underworld but by producing a son and heir to avenge his death and carry out funerary rites for him isis has ensured that her husband will endure in the afterlife 26 isis s role in afterlife beliefs was based on that in the myth she helped to restore the souls of deceased humans to wholeness as she had done for osiris like other goddesses such as hathor she also acted as a mother to the deceased providing protection and nourishment 27 thus like hathor she sometimes took the form of imentet the goddess of the west who welcomed the deceased soul into the afterlife as her child 28 but for much of egyptian history male deities such as osiris were believed to provide the regenerative powers including sexual potency that were crucial for rebirth isis was thought to merely assist by stimulating this power 27 feminine divine powers became more important in afterlife beliefs in the late new kingdom 29 various ptolemaic funerary texts emphasize that isis took the active role in horus s conception by sexually stimulating her inert husband 30 some tomb decoration from the roman period in egypt depicts isis in a central role in the afterlife 31 and a funerary text from that era suggests that women were thought able to join the retinue of isis and nephthys in the afterlife 32 mother goddess isis nursing horus a sculpture from the 7th century bce isis is treated as the mother of horus even in the earliest copies of the pyramid texts 33 yet there are signs that hathor was originally regarded as his mother 34 and other traditions make an elder form of horus the son of nut and a sibling of isis and osiris 35 isis may only have come to be horus s mother as the osiris myth took shape during the old kingdom 34 but through her relationship with him she came to be seen as the epitome of maternal devotion 36 in the developed form of the myth isis gives birth to horus after a long pregnancy and a difficult labor in the papyrus thickets of the nile delta as her child grows she must protect him from set and many other hazards snakes scorpions and simple illness 37 in some texts isis travels among humans and must seek their help according to one such story seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard her they take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help isis by stinging the woman s son making it necessary for the goddess to heal the blameless child 38 isis s reputation as a compassionate deity willing to relieve human suffering contributed greatly to her appeal 39 isis continues to assist her son when he challenges set to claim the kingship that set has usurped 40 although mother and son are sometimes portrayed in conflict as when horus beheads isis and she replaces her original head with that of a cow an origin myth explaining the cow horn headdress that isis wears 41 isis s maternal aspect extended to other deities as well the coffin texts from the middle kingdom c 2055 1650 bce say the four sons of horus funerary deities who were thought to protect the internal organs of the deceased were the offspring of isis and the elder form of horus 42 in the same era horus was syncretized with the fertility god min so isis was regarded as min s mother 43 a form of min known as kamutef bull of his mother who represented the cyclical regeneration of the gods and of kingship was said to impregnate his mother to engender himself 44 thus isis was also regarded as min s consort 45 the same ideology of kingship may lie behind a tradition found in a few texts that horus raped isis 46 47 amun the foremost egyptian deity during the middle and new kingdoms also took on the role of kamutef and when he was in this form isis often acted as his consort 45 apis a bull that was worshipped as a living god at memphis was said to be isis s son fathered by a form of osiris known as osiris apis the biological mother of each apis bull was thus known as the isis cow 48 isis was said to be the mother of bastet by ra 49 a story in the westcar papyrus from the middle kingdom includes isis among a group of goddesses who serve as midwives during the delivery of three future kings 50 she serves a similar role in new kingdom texts that describe the divinely ordained births of reigning pharaohs 51 in the westcar papyrus isis calls out the names of the three children as they are born barbara s lesko sees this story as a sign that isis had the power to predict or influence future events as did other deities who presided over birth 45 such as shai and renenutet 52 texts from much later times call isis mistress of life ruler of fate and destiny 45 and indicate she has control over shai and renenutet just as other great deities such as amun were said to do in earlier eras of egyptian history by governing these deities isis determined the length and quality of human lives 52 goddess of kingship and protection of the kingdom isis holds the king seti i in her lap thirteenth century bce horus was equated with each living pharaoh and osiris with the pharaoh s deceased predecessors isis was therefore the mythological mother and wife of kings in the pyramid texts her primary importance to the king was as one of the deities who protected and assisted him in the afterlife her prominence in royal ideology grew in the new kingdom 53 temple reliefs from that time on show the king nursing at isis s breast her milk not only healed her child but symbolized his divine right to rule 54 royal ideology increasingly emphasized the importance of queens as earthly counterparts of the goddesses who served as wives to the king and mothers to his heirs initially the most important of these goddesses was hathor whose attributes in art were incorporated into queens crowns but because of her own mythological links with queenship isis too was given the same titles and regalia as human queens 55 isis s actions in protecting osiris against set became part of a larger more warlike aspect of her character 56 new kingdom funerary texts portray isis in the barque of ra as he sails through the underworld acting as one of several deities who subdue ra s archenemy apep 57 kings also called upon her protective magical power against human enemies in her ptolemaic temple at philae which lay near the frontier with nubian peoples who raided egypt she was described as the protectress of the entire nation more effective in battle than millions of soldiers supporting ptolemaic kings and roman emperors in their efforts to subdue egypt s enemies 56 goddess of magic and wisdom isis was also known for her magical power which enabled her to revive osiris and to protect and heal horus and for her cunning 58 by virtue of her magical knowledge she was said to be more clever than a million gods 59 60 in several episodes in the new kingdom story the contendings of horus and set isis uses these abilities to outmaneuver set during his conflict with her son on one occasion she transforms into a young woman who tells set she is involved in an inheritance dispute similar to set s usurpation of osiris s crown when set calls this situation unjust isis taunts him saying he has judged himself to be in the wrong 60 in later texts she uses her powers of transformation to fight and destroy set and his followers 58 many stories about isis appear as historiolae prologues to magical texts that describe mythic events related to the goal that the spell aims to accomplish 19 in one spell isis creates a snake that bites ra who is older and greater than she is and makes him ill with its venom she offers to cure ra if he will tell her his true secret name a piece of knowledge that carries with it incomparable power after much coercion ra tells her his name which she passes on to horus bolstering his royal authority 60 the story may be meant as an origin story to explain why isis s magical ability surpasses that of other deities but because she uses magic to subdue ra the story seems to treat her as having such abilities even before learning his name 61 sky goddess many of the roles isis acquired gave her an important position in the sky 62 passages in the pyramid texts connect isis closely with sopdet the goddess representing the star sirius whose relationship with her husband sah the constellation orion and their son sopdu parallels isis s relations with osiris and horus sirius s heliacal rising just before the start of the nile flood gave sopdet a close connection with the flood and the resulting growth of plants 63 partly because of her relationship with sopdet isis was also linked with the flood 64 which was sometimes equated with the tears she shed for osiris 65 by ptolemaic times she was connected with rain which egyptian texts call a nile in the sky with the sun as the protector of ra s barque 66 and with the moon possibly because she was linked with the greek lunar goddess artemis by a shared connection with an egyptian fertility goddess bastet 67 in hymns inscribed at philae she is called the lady of heaven whose dominion over the sky parallels osiris s rule over the duat and horus s kingship on earth 68 universal goddess in ptolemaic times isis s sphere of influence could include the entire cosmos 68 as the deity that protected egypt and endorsed its king she had power over all nations and as the provider of rain she enlivened the natural world 69 the philae hymn that initially calls her ruler of the sky goes on to expand her authority so at its climax her dominion encompasses the sky earth and duat it says her power over nature nourishes humans the blessed dead and the gods 68 other greek language hymns from ptolemaic egypt call her the beautiful essence of all the gods 70 in the course of egyptian history many deities major and minor had been described in similar grand terms amun was most commonly described this way in the new kingdom whereas in roman egypt such terms tended to be applied to isis 71 such texts do not deny the existence of other deities but treat them as aspects of the supreme deity a type of theology sometimes called summodeism 72 73 in the late ptolemaic and roman periods many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long standing ideas about creation to give the primary roles to local deities 74 at philae isis is described as the creator in the same way that older texts speak of the work of the god ptah 68 who was said to have designed the world with his intellect and sculpted it into being 75 like him isis formed the cosmos through what her heart conceived and her hands created 68 like other deities throughout egyptian history isis had many forms in her individual cult centers and each cult center emphasized different aspects of her character local isis cults focused on the distinctive traits of their deity more than on her universality whereas some egyptian hymns to isis treat other goddesses in cult centers from across egypt and the mediterranean as manifestations of her a text in her temple at dendera says in each nome it is she who is in every town in every nome with her son horus 76 iconography in ancient egyptian art isis was most commonly depicted as a woman with the typical attributes of a goddess a sheath dress a staff of papyrus in one hand and an ankh sign in the other her original headdress was the throne sign used in writing her name she and nephthys often appear together particularly when mourning osiris s death supporting him on his throne or protecting the sarcophagi of the dead in these situations their arms are often flung across their faces in a gesture of mourning or outstretched around osiris or the deceased as a sign of their protective role 77 in these circumstances they were often depicted as kites or women with the wings of kites this form may be inspired by a similarity between the kites calls and the cries of wailing women 78 or by a metaphor likening the kite s search for carrion to the goddesses search for their dead brother 77 isis sometimes appeared in other animal forms as a sow representing her maternal character as a cow particularly when linked with apis or as a scorpion 77 she also took the form of a tree or a woman emerging from a tree sometimes offering food and water to deceased souls this form alluded to the maternal nourishment she provided 79 beginning in the new kingdom thanks to the close links between isis and hathor isis took on hathor s attributes such as a sistrum rattle and a headdress of cow horns enclosing a sun disk sometimes both headdresses were combined so the throne glyph sat atop the sun disk 77 in the same era she began to wear the insignia of a human queen such as a vulture shaped crown on her head and the royal uraeus or rearing cobra on her brow 55 in ptolemaic and roman times statues and figurines of isis often showed her in a greek sculptural style with attributes taken from egyptian and greek tradition 80 81 some of these images reflected her linkage with other goddesses in novel ways isis thermuthis a combination of isis and renenutet who represented agricultural fertility was depicted in this style as a woman with the lower body of a snake figurines of a woman wearing an elaborate headdress and exposing her genitals may represent isis aphrodite 82 note 3 the tyet symbol a looped shape similar to the ankh came to be seen as isis s emblem at least as early as the new kingdom though it existed long before 84 it was often made of red jasper and likened to isis s blood used as a funerary amulet it was said to confer her protection on the wearer 85 isis with a combination of throne glyph and cow horns as well as a vulture headdress

second or first century bce a tyet amulet fifteenth or fourteenth century bce worship relationship with royalty despite her significance in the osiris myth isis was originally a minor deity in the ideology surrounding the living king she played only a small role for instance in the dramatic ramesseum papyrus the script for royal rituals performed in the reign of senusret i in the middle kingdom 86 her importance grew during the new kingdom 87 when she was increasingly connected with hathor and the human queen 88 the early first millennium bce saw an increased emphasis on the family triad of osiris isis and horus and an explosive growth in isis s popularity in the fourth century bce nectanebo i of the thirtieth dynasty claimed isis as his patron deity tying her still more closely to political power 89 the kingdom of kush which ruled nubia from the eighth century bce to the fourth century ce absorbed and adapted the egyptian ideology surrounding kingship it equated isis with the kandake the queen or queen mother of the kushite king 90 the ptolemaic greek kings who ruled egypt as pharaohs from 305 to 30 bce developed an ideology that linked them with both egyptian and greek deities to strengthen their claim to the throne in the eyes of their greek and egyptian subjects for centuries before greek colonists and visitors to egypt had drawn parallels between egyptian deities and their own in a process known as interpretatio graeca 91 herodotus a greek who wrote about egypt in the fifth century bce likened isis to demeter whose mythical search for her daughter persephone resembled isis s search for osiris demeter was one of the few greek deities to be widely adopted by egyptians in ptolemaic times so the similarity between her and isis provided a link between the two cultures 92 in other cases isis was linked with aphrodite through the sexual aspects of her character 93 building on these traditions the first two ptolemies promoted the cult of the new god serapis who combined aspects of osiris and apis with those of greek gods such as zeus and dionysus isis portrayed in a hellenized form was regarded as the consort of serapis as well as of osiris ptolemy ii and his sister and wife arsinoe ii developed a ruler cult around themselves so that they were worshipped in the same temples as serapis and isis and arsinoe was likened to both isis and aphrodite 94 some later ptolemaic queens identified themselves still more closely with isis cleopatra iii in the second century bce used isis s name in place of her own in inscriptions and cleopatra vii the last ruler of egypt before it was annexed by rome used the epithet the new isis 95 temples and festivals philae as seen from bigeh island painted by david roberts in 1838 down to the end of the new kingdom isis s cult was closely tied to those of male deities such as osiris min or amun she was commonly worshipped alongside them as their mother or consort and she was especially widely worshipped as the mother of various local forms of horus 96 nevertheless she had independent priesthoods at some sites 97 and at least one temple of her own at osiris s cult center of abydos during the late new kingdom 98 the earliest known major temples to isis were the iseion at behbeit el hagar in northern egypt and philae in the far south both began construction during the thirtieth dynasty and were completed or enlarged by ptolemaic kings 99 thanks to isis s widespread fame philae drew pilgrims from across the mediterranean 100 many other temples of isis sprang up in ptolemaic times ranging from alexandria and canopus on the mediterranean coast to egypt s frontier with nubia 101 a series of temples of isis stood in that region stretching from philae south to maharraqa and were sites of worship for both egyptians and various nubian peoples 102 the nubians of kush built their own temples to isis at sites as far south as wad ban naqa 103 including one in their capital meroe 104 the most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual in which priests clothed the deity s cult image and offered it food 105 in roman times temples to isis in egypt could be built either in egyptian style in which the cult image was in a secluded sanctuary accessible only to priests and in a greco roman style in which devotees were allowed to see the cult image 106 greek and egyptian culture were highly intermingled by this time and there may have been no ethnic separation between isis s worshippers 107 the same people may have prayed to isis outside egyptian style temples and in front of her statue inside greek style temples 106 temples celebrated many festivals in the course of the year some nationwide and some very local 108 an elaborate series of rites were performed all across egypt for osiris during the month of khoiak 109 and isis and nephthys were prominent in these rites at least as early as the new kingdom 110 in ptolemaic times two women acted out the roles of isis and nephthys during khoiak singing or chanting in mourning for their dead brother their chants are preserved in the festival songs of isis and nephthys and lamentations of isis and nephthys 110 111 festivals dedicated to isis eventually developed in roman times egyptians across the country celebrated her birthday the amesysia by carrying the local cult statue of isis through their fields probably celebrating her powers of fertility 112 the priests at philae held a festival every ten days when the cult statue of isis visited the neighboring island of bigeh which was said to be osiris s place of burial and the priests performed funerary rites for him the cult statue also visited the neighboring temples to the south even during the last centuries of activity at philae when those temples were run by nubian peoples outside roman rule 113 christianity became the dominant religion in the roman empire including egypt during the fourth and fifth centuries ce egyptian temple cults died out gradually and at various times from a combination of lack of funds and christian hostility 114 isis s temple at philae supported by its nubian worshippers still had an organized priesthood and regular festivals until at least the mid fifth century ce making it the last fully functioning temple in egypt 115 note 4 funerary isis left and nephthys as kites near the bier of a mummy thirteenth century bce in many spells in the pyramid texts isis and nephthys help the deceased king reach the afterlife in the coffin texts from the middle kingdom isis appears still more frequently though in these texts osiris is credited with reviving the dead more often than she is new kingdom sources such as the book of the dead describe isis as protecting deceased souls as they face the dangers in the duat they also describe isis as a member of the divine councils that judge souls moral righteousness before admitting them into the afterlife and she appears in vignettes standing beside osiris as he presides over this tribunal 117 isis and nephthys took part in funeral ceremonies where two wailing women much like those in the festival at abydos mourned the deceased as the two goddesses mourned osiris 118 isis was frequently shown or alluded to in funerary equipment on sarcophagi and canopic chests as one of the four goddesses who protected the four sons of horus in tomb art offering her enlivening milk to the dead and in the tyet amulets that were often placed on mummies to ensure that isis s power would shield them from harm 119 late funerary texts prominently featured her mourning for osiris and one such text one of the books of breathing was said to have been written by her for osiris s benefit 120 in nubian funerary religion isis was regarded as more significant than her husband because she was the active partner while he only passively received the offerings she made to sustain him in the afterlife 121 popular worship unlike many egyptian deities isis was rarely addressed in prayers 122 or invoked in personal names before the end of the new kingdom 123 from the late period on she became one of the deities most commonly mentioned in these sources which often refer to her kindly character and her willingness to answer those who call upon her for help 124 hundreds of thousands of amulets and votive statues of isis nursing horus were made during the first millennium bce 125 and in roman egypt she was among the deities most commonly represented in household religious art such as figurines and panel paintings 126 isis was prominent in magical texts from the middle kingdom onward the dangers horus faces in childhood are a frequent theme in magical healing spells in which isis s efforts to heal him are extended to cure any patient in many of these spells isis forces ra to help horus by declaring that she will stop the sun in its course through the sky unless her son is cured 127 other spells equated pregnant women with isis to ensure that they would deliver their children successfully 128 egyptian magic began to incorporate christian concepts as christianity was established in egypt but egyptian and greek deities continued to appear in spells long after their temple worship had ceased 129 spells that may date to the sixth seventh or eighth centuries ce invoke the name of isis alongside christian figures 130 in the greco roman world spread the remains of the temple of isis on delos the temple of isis in pompeii cossura bronze coin showing a portrait of isis with punic legend cults based in a particular city or nation were the norm across the ancient world until the mid to late first millennium bce when increased contact between different cultures allowed some cults to spread more widely greeks were aware of egyptian deities including isis at least as early as the archaic period c 700 480 bce and her first known temple in greece was built during or before the fourth century bce by egyptians living in athens the conquests of alexander the great late in that century created hellenistic kingdoms around the mediterranean and near east including ptolemaic egypt and put greek and non greek religions in much closer contact the resulting diffusion of cultures allowed many religious traditions to spread across the hellenistic world in the last three centuries bce the new mobile cults adapted greatly to appeal to people from a variety of cultures the cults of isis and serapis were among those that expanded in this way 131 spread by merchants and other mediterranean travelers the cults of isis and serapis were established in greek port cities at the end of the fourth century bce and expanded throughout greece and asia minor during the third and second centuries the greek island of delos was an early cult center for both deities and its status as a trading center made it a springboard for the egyptian cults to diffuse into italy 132 isis and serapis were also worshipped at scattered sites in the seleucid empire the hellenistic kingdom in the middle east as far east as iran though they disappeared from the region as the seleucids lost their eastern territory to the parthian empire 133 greeks regarded egyptian religion as exotic and sometimes bizarre yet full of ancient wisdom 134 like other cults from the eastern regions of the mediterranean the cult of isis attracted greeks and romans by playing upon its exotic origins 135 but the form it took after reaching greece was heavily hellenized 136 isis s cult reached italy and the roman sphere of influence at some point in the second century bce 137 it was one of many cults that were introduced to rome as the roman republic s territory expanded in the last centuries bce authorities in the republic tried to define which cults were acceptable and which were not as a way of defining roman cultural identity amid the cultural changes brought on by rome s expansion 138 in isis s case shrines and altars to her were set up on the capitoline hill at the heart of the city by private persons in the early first century bce 137 the independence of her cult from the control of roman authorities made it potentially unsettling to them 139 in the 50s and 40s bce when the crisis of the roman republic made many romans fear that peace among the gods was being disrupted the roman senate destroyed these shrines 140 141 although it did not ban isis from the city outright 137 egyptian cults faced further hostility during the final war of the roman republic 32 30 bce when rome led by octavian the future emperor augustus fought egypt under cleopatra vii 142 after octavian s victory he banned shrines to isis and serapis within the pomerium the city s innermost sacred boundary but allowed them in parts of the city outside the pomerium thus marking egyptian deities as non roman but acceptable to rome 143 despite being temporarily expelled from rome during the reign of tiberius 14 37 ce note 5 the egyptian cults gradually became an accepted part of the roman religious landscape the flavian emperors in the late first century ce treated serapis and isis as patrons of their rule in much the same manner as traditional roman deities such as jupiter and minerva 145 even as it was being integrated into roman culture isis s worship developed new features that emphasized its egyptian background 146 147 the cults also expanded into rome s western provinces beginning along the mediterranean coast in early imperial times at their peak in the late second and early third centuries ce isis and serapis were worshipped in most towns across the western empire though without much presence in the countryside 148 their temples were found from petra and palmyra in the arabian and syrian provinces to italica in spain and londinium in britain 149 by this time they were on a comparable footing with native roman deities 150 roles roman statue of isis first or second century ce she holds a sistrum and a pitcher of water although these attributes were added in a seventeenth century renovation 151 isis s cult like others in the greco roman world had no firm dogma and its beliefs and practices may have stayed only loosely similar as it diffused across the region and evolved over time 152 153 greek aretalogies that praise isis provide much of the information about these beliefs parts of these aretalogies closely resemble ideas in late egyptian hymns like those at philae while other elements are thoroughly greek 154 other information comes from plutarch c 46 120 ce whose book on isis and osiris interprets the egyptian deities based on his middle platonist philosophy 155 and from several works of greek and latin literature that refer to isis s worship especially a novel by apuleius c 125 180 ce known as metamorphoses or the golden ass which ends by describing how the main character has a vision of the goddess and becomes her devotee 156 elaborating upon isis s role as a wife and mother in the osiris myth aretalogies call her the inventor of marriage and parenthood she was invoked to protect women in childbirth and in ancient greek novels such as the ephesian tale to protect their virginity 157 some ancient texts called her the patroness of women in general 158 159 her cult may have served to promote women s autonomy in a limited way with isis s power and authority serving as a precedent but in myth she was devoted to and never fully independent of her husband and son the aretalogies show ambiguous attitudes toward women s independence one says isis made women equal to men whereas another says she made women subordinate to their husbands 160 161 isis was often characterized as a moon goddess paralleling the solar characteristics of serapis 162 she was also seen as a cosmic goddess more generally various texts claim she organized the behavior of the sun moon and stars governing time and the seasons which in turn guaranteed the fertility of the earth 163 these texts also credit her with inventing agriculture establishing laws and devising or promoting other elements of human society this idea derives from older greek traditions about the role of various greek deities and culture heroes including demeter in establishing civilization 164 she also oversaw seas and harbors sailors left inscriptions calling upon her to ensure the safety and good fortune of their voyages in this role she was called isis pelagia isis of the sea or isis pharia referring to a sail or to the island of pharos site of the lighthouse of alexandria 165 this form of isis which emerged in hellenistic times may have been inspired by egyptian images of isis in a barque as well as by greek deities who protected seafaring such as aphrodite 166 167 isis pelagia developed an added significance in rome rome s food supply was dependent on grain shipments from its provinces especially egypt isis therefore guaranteed fertile harvests and protected the ships that carried the resulting food across the seas and thus ensured the well being of the empire as a whole 168 her protection of the state was said to extend to rome s armies much as it was in ptolemaic egypt and she was sometimes called isis invicta unconquered isis 169 her roles were so numerous that she came to be called myrionymos one with countless names and panthea all goddess 170 both plutarch and a later philosopher proclus mentioned a veiled statue of the egyptian goddess neith whom they conflated with isis citing it as an example of her universality and enigmatic wisdom it bore the words i am all that has been and is and will be and no mortal has ever lifted my mantle 171 note 6 isis was also said to benefit her followers in the afterlife which was not much emphasized in greek and roman religion 174 the golden ass and inscriptions left by worshippers of isis suggest that many of her followers thought she would guarantee them a better afterlife in return for their devotion they characterized this afterlife inconsistently some said they would benefit from osiris s enlivening water while others expected to sail to the fortunate isles of greek tradition 175 as in egypt isis was said to have power over fate which in traditional greek religion was a power not even the gods could defy valentino gasparini says this control over destiny binds together isis s disparate traits she governs the cosmos yet she also relieves people of their comparatively trivial misfortunes and her influence extends into the realm of death which is individual and universal at the same time 176 relationships with other deities isis welcoming io to egypt from a fresco at pompeii first century ce more than a dozen egyptian deities were worshipped outside egypt in hellenistic and roman times in a series of interrelated cults though many were fairly minor 177 of the most important of these deities serapis was closely connected with isis and often appeared with her in art but osiris remained central to her myth and prominent in her rituals 178 temples to isis and serapis sometimes stood next to each other but it was rare for a single temple to be dedicated to both 179 osiris as a dead deity unlike the immortal gods of greece seemed strange to greeks and played only a minor role in egyptian cults in hellenistic times in roman times he became like dionysus a symbol of a joyous afterlife and the isis cult increasingly focused on him 180 horus often under the name harpocrates also appeared in isis s temples as her son by osiris or serapis he absorbed traits from greek deities such as apollo and served as a god of the sun and of crops 181 another member of the group was anubis who was linked to the greek god hermes in his hellenized form hermanubis 182 isis was also sometimes said to have learned her wisdom from or even be the daughter of thoth the egyptian god of writing and knowledge who was known in the greco roman world as hermes trismegistus 183 184 isis also had an extensive network of connections with greek and roman deities as well as some from other cultures she was not fully integrated into the greek pantheon but she was at different times equated with a variety of greek mythological figures including demeter aphrodite or io a human woman who was turned into a cow and chased by the goddess hera from greece to egypt 185 the cult of demeter was an especially important influence on isis s worship after its arrival in greece 186 isis s relationship with women was influenced by her frequent equation with artemis who had a dual role as a virgin goddess and a promoter of fertility 187 because of isis s power over fate she was linked with the greek and roman personifications of fortune tyche and fortuna 188 at byblos in phoenicia in the second millennium bce hathor had been worshipped as a form of the local goddess baalat gebal isis gradually replaced hathor there in the course of the first millennium bce 189 in noricum in central europe isis was syncretized with the local tutelary deity noreia 190 and at petra she may have been linked with the arab goddess al uzza 191 the roman author tacitus said isis was worshipped by the suebi a germanic people living outside the empire but he may have mistaken a germanic goddess for isis because like her the goddess was symbolized by a ship 192 many of the aretalogies include long lists of goddesses with whom isis was linked these texts treat all the deities they list as forms of her suggesting that in the eyes of the authors she was a summodeistic being the one goddess for the entire civilized world 193 194 in the roman religious world many deities were referred to as one or unique in religious texts like these at the same time hellenistic philosophers frequently saw the unifying abstract principle of the cosmos as divine many of them reinterpreted traditional religions to fit their concept of this highest being as plutarch did with isis and osiris 195 in the golden ass isis says my one person manifests the aspects of all the gods and goddesses and that she is worshipped by all the world under different forms with various rites and by manifold names although the egyptians and nubians use her true name isis 196 197 but when she lists the forms in which various mediterranean peoples worship her she mentions only female deities 198 greco roman deities were firmly divided by gender thus limiting how universal isis could truly be one aretalogy avoids this problem by calling isis and serapis who was often said to subsume many male gods the two unique deities 199 200 similarly both plutarch and apuleius limit isis s importance by treating her as ultimately subordinate to osiris 201 the claim that she was unique was meant to emphasize her greatness more than to make a precise theological statement 199 200 iconography images of isis made outside egypt were hellenistic in style like many of the images of her made in egypt in hellenistic and roman times the attributes she bore varied widely 202 she sometimes wore the hathoric cow horn headdress but greeks and romans reduced its size and often interpreted it as a crescent moon 203 she could also wear headdresses incorporating leaves flowers or ears of grain 204 other common traits included corkscrew locks of hair and an elaborate mantle tied in a large knot over the breasts which originated in ordinary egyptian clothing but was treated as a symbol of the goddess outside egypt 205 note 7 in her hands she could carry a uraeus or a sistrum both taken from her egyptian iconography 207 or a situla a vessel used for libations of water or milk that were performed in isis s cult 208 as isis fortuna or isis tyche she held a rudder representing control of fate in her right hand and a cornucopia standing for abundance in her left 209 as isis pharia she wore a cloak that billowed behind her like a sail and as isis lactans she nursed harpocrates 210 at times she was shown resting a foot on a celestial sphere representing her control of the cosmos 211 the diverse imagery sprang from her varied roles as robert steven bianchi says isis could represent anything to anyone and could be represented in any way imaginable 212 bust of isis sothis demeter from hadrian s villa second century ce statue of isis persephone with corkscrew locks of hair and a sistrum from gortyna second century ce isis aphrodite polychrome terracotta alexandria first century ce bronze figurine of isis fortuna with a cornucopia and a rudder first century ce fresco of isis wearing a crescent headdress and resting her foot on a celestial sphere first century ce anubis harpocrates isis and serapis fresco from pompeii worship adherents and priests like most cults of the time the isis cult did not require its devotees to worship isis exclusively and their level of commitment probably varied greatly 213 some devotees of isis served as priests in a variety of cults and underwent several initiations dedicated to different deities 214 nevertheless many emphasized their strong devotion to her and some considered her the focus of their lives 215 they were among the very few religious groups in the greco roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves loosely equivalent to jew or christian that might indicate they defined themselves by their religious affiliation however the word isiacus or isiac was rarely used 213 isiacs were a very small proportion of the roman empire s population 216 but they came from every level of society from slaves and freedmen to high officials and members of the imperial family 217 ancient accounts imply that isis was popular with lower social classes providing a possible reason why authorities in the roman republic troubled by struggles between classes regarded her cult with suspicion 218 women were more strongly represented in the isis cult than in most greco roman cults and in imperial times they could serve as priestesses in many of the same positions in the hierarchy as their male counterparts 219 women make up much less than half of the isiacs known from inscriptions and are rarely listed among the higher ranks of priests 220 but because women are underrepresented in roman inscriptions their participation may have been greater than is recorded 221 several roman writers accused isis s cult of encouraging promiscuity among women jaime alvar suggests the cult attracted male suspicion simply because it gave women a venue to act outside their husbands control 222 priests of isis were known for their distinctive shaven heads and white linen clothes both characteristics drawn from egyptian priesthoods and their requirements of ritual purity 223 a temple of isis could include several ranks of priests as well as various cultic associations and specialized duties for lay devotees 224 there is no evidence of a hierarchy overseeing multiple temples and each temple may well have functioned independently of the others 225 temples and daily rites fresco of an isiac gathering first century ce one priest tends a fire while another holds up a vessel of sacred water at the door of a temple flanked by sphinxes 226 temples to egyptian deities outside egypt such as the red basilica in pergamon the temple of isis at pompeii or the iseum campense in rome were built in a largely greco roman style but like egyptian temples were surrounded by large courts enclosed by walls they were decorated with egyptian themed artwork sometimes including antiquities imported from egypt their layout was more elaborate than that of traditional roman temples and included rooms for housing priests and for various ritual functions with a cult statue of the goddess in a secluded sanctuary 227 228 unlike egyptian cult images isis s hellenistic and roman statues were life size or larger the daily ritual still entailed dressing the statue in elaborate clothes each morning and offering it libations but in contrast with egyptian tradition the priests allowed ordinary devotees of isis to see the cult statue during the morning ritual pray to it directly and sing hymns before it 229 another object of veneration in these temples was water which was treated as a symbol of the waters of the nile isis temples built in hellenistic times often included underground cisterns that stored this sacred water raising and lowering the water level in imitation of the nile flood many roman temples instead used a pitcher of water that was worshipped as a cult image or manifestation of osiris 230 personal worship roman lararia or household shrines contained statuettes of the penates a varied group of protective deities chosen based on the preferences of the members of the household 231 isis and other egyptian deities were found in lararia in italy from the late first century bce 232 to the beginning of the fourth century ce 233 the cult asked both ritual and moral purity of its devotees periodically requiring ritual baths or days long periods of sexual abstinence isiacs sometimes displayed their piety on irregular occasions singing isis s praises in the streets or as a form of penance declaring their misdeeds in public 234 some temples to greek deities including serapis practiced incubation in which worshippers slept in a temple hoping that the god would appear to them in a dream and give them advice or heal their ailments some scholars believe that this practice took place in isis s temples but there is no firm evidence that it did 235 isis was however thought to communicate through dreams in other circumstances including to call worshippers to undergo initiation 236 initiation main article mysteries of isis some temples of isis performed mystery rites to initiate new members of the cult these rites were claimed to be of egyptian origin and may have drawn on the secretive tendencies of some egyptian rites 237 however they were mainly based on greek mystery cults especially the eleusinian mysteries dedicated to demeter colored with egyptian elements 238 239 note 8 although mystery rites are among the best known elements of isis s greco roman cult they are only known to have been performed in italy greece and asia minor 242 by giving the devotee a dramatic mystical experience of the goddess initiations added emotional intensity to the process of joining her following 236 the golden ass in describing how the protagonist joins isis s cult gives the only detailed account of isiac initiation 244 apuleius s motives for writing about the cult and the accuracy of his fictionalized description are much debated but the account is broadly consistent with other evidence about initiations and scholars rely heavily on it when studying the subject 245 ancient mystery rites used a variety of intense experiences such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise to overwhelm their senses and give them an intense religious experience that felt like direct contact with the god they devoted themselves to 246 apuleius s protagonist lucius undergoes a series of initiations though only the first is described in detail after entering the innermost part of isis s temple at night he says i came to the boundary of death and having trodden on the threshold of proserpina i travelled through all the elements and returned in the middle of the night i saw the sun flashing with bright light i came face to face with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand 247 this cryptic description suggests that the initiate s symbolic journey to the world of the dead was likened to osiris s rebirth as well as to ra s journey through the underworld in egyptian myth 248 possibly implying that isis brought the initiate back from death as she did her husband 249 festivals roman calendars listed the two most important festivals of isis as early as the first century ce the first festival was the navigium isidis in march which celebrated isis s influence over the sea and served as a prayer for the safety of seafarers and eventually of the roman people and their leaders 250 it consisted of an elaborate procession including isiac priests and devotees with a wide variety of costumes and sacred emblems carrying a model ship from the local isis temple to the sea 251 or to a nearby river 252 the other was the isia in late october and early november like its egyptian forerunner the khoiak festival the isia included a ritual reenactment of isis s search for osiris followed by jubilation when the god s body was found 253 several more minor festivals were dedicated to isis including the pelusia in late march that may have celebrated the birth of harpocrates and the lychnapsia or lamp lit festival that celebrated isis s own birth on august 12 250 festivals of isis and other polytheistic deities were celebrated throughout the fourth century ce despite the growth of christianity in that era and the persecution of pagans that intensified toward the end of the century 254 the isia was celebrated at least as late as 417 ce 255 and the navigium isidis lasted well into the sixth century 256 increasingly the religious meaning of all roman festivals was forgotten or ignored even as the customs continued in some cases these customs became part of the combined classical and christian culture of the early middle ages 257 possible influence on christianity isis lactans holding harpocrates in an egyptian fresco from the fourth century ce a contentious question about isis is whether her cult influenced christianity 258 some isiac customs may have been among the pagan religious practices that were incorporated into christian traditions as the roman empire was christianized andreas alföldi for instance argued in the 1930s that the medieval carnival festival in which a model boat was carried developed from the navigium isidis 259 much attention focuses on whether traits of christianity were borrowed from pagan mystery cults including that of isis 260 the more devoted members of isis s cult made a personal commitment to a deity they regarded as superior to others as christians did 261 both christianity and the isis cult had an initiation rite the mysteries for isis baptism in christianity 262 one of the mystery cults shared themes a god whose death and resurrection may be connected with the individual worshipper s well being in the afterlife resembles the central theme of christianity the suggestion that christianity s basic beliefs were taken from mystery cults has provoked heated debate for more than 200 years 263 in response to these controversies both hugh bowden and jaime alvar scholars who study ancient mystery cults suggest that similarities between christianity and the mystery cults were not produced by direct borrowing of ideas but by their common background the greco roman culture in which they all developed 262 264 similarities between isis and mary the mother of jesus have also been scrutinized they have been subject to controversy between protestant christians and the catholic church as many protestants have argued that catholic veneration of mary is a remnant of paganism 265 the classicist r e witt saw isis as the great forerunner of mary he suggested that converts to christianity who had formerly worshipped isis would have seen mary in much the same terms as their traditional goddess he pointed out that the two had several spheres of influence in common such as agriculture and the protection of sailors he compared mary s title mother of god to isis s epithet mother of the god and mary s queen of heaven to isis s queen of heaven 266 stephen benko a historian of early christianity argues that devotion to mary was deeply influenced by the worship of several goddesses not just isis 267 in contrast john mcguckin a church historian says that mary absorbed superficial traits from these goddesses such as iconography but the fundamentals of her cult were thoroughly christian 268 images of isis with horus in her lap are often suggested as an influence on the iconography of mary particularly images of the mary nursing the infant jesus as images of nursing women were rare in the ancient mediterranean world outside egypt 269 vincent tran tam tinh points out that the latest images of isis nursing horus date to the fourth century ce while the earliest images of mary nursing jesus date to the seventh century ce sabrina higgins drawing on his study argues that if there is a connection between the iconographies of isis and mary it is limited to images from egypt 270 in contrast thomas f mathews and norman muller think isis s pose in late antique panel paintings influenced several types of marian icons inside and outside egypt 271 elizabeth bolman says these early egyptian images of mary nursing jesus were meant to emphasize his divinity much as images of nursing goddesses did in ancient egyptian iconography 272 higgins argues that such similarities prove that images of isis influenced those of mary but not that christians deliberately adopted isis s iconography or other elements of her cult 273 influence in later cultures further information ancient egypt in the western imagination and egyptian influence in popular culture isis as a veiled goddess of life at the herbert hoover national historic site the memory of isis survived the extinction of her worship like the greeks and romans many modern europeans have regarded ancient egypt as the home of profound and often mystical wisdom and this wisdom has often been linked with isis 274 giovanni boccaccio s biography of isis in his 1374 work de mulieribus claris based on classical sources treated her as a historical queen who taught skills of civilization to humankind some renaissance thinkers elaborated this perspective on isis annio da viterbo in the 1490s claimed isis and osiris had civilized italy before greece thus drawing a direct connection between his home country and egypt the borgia apartments painted for annio s patron pope alexander vi incorporate this same theme in their illustrated rendition of the osiris myth 275 western esotericism has often made reference to isis two roman esoteric texts used the mythic motif in which isis passes down secret knowledge to horus in kore kosmou she teaches him wisdom passed down from hermes trismegistus 276 and in the early alchemical text isis the prophetess to her son horus she gives him alchemical recipes 277 early modern esoteric literature which saw hermes trismegistus as an egyptian sage and frequently made use of texts attributed to his hand sometimes referred to isis as well 278 in a different vein apuleius s description of isiac initiation has influenced the practices of many secret societies 279 jean terrasson s 1731 novel sethos used apuleius as inspiration for a fanciful egyptian initiation rite dedicated to isis 280 it was imitated by actual rituals in various masonic and masonic inspired societies during the eighteenth century as well as in other literary works most notably wolfgang amadeus mozart s 1791 opera the magic flute 281 from the renaissance on the veiled statue of isis that plutarch and proclus mentioned was interpreted as a personification of nature based on a passage in the works of macrobius in the fifth century ce that equated isis with nature 282 note 9 authors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ascribed a wide variety of meanings to this image isis represented nature as the mother of all things as a set of truths waiting to be unveiled by science as a symbol of the pantheist concept of an anonymous enigmatic deity who was immanent within nature 283 or as an awe inspiring sublime power that could be experienced through ecstatic mystery rites 284 in the dechristianization of france during the french revolution she served as an alternative to traditional christianity a symbol that could represent nature modern scientific wisdom and a link to the pre christian past 285 for these reasons isis s image appeared in artwork sponsored by the revolutionary government such as the fontaine de la régénération and by the first french empire 286 287 the metaphor of isis s veil continued to circulate through the nineteenth century helena blavatsky the founder of the esoteric theosophical tradition titled her 1877 book on theosophy isis unveiled implying that it would reveal spiritual truths about nature that science could not 288 among modern egyptians isis was used as a national symbol during the pharaonism movement of the 1920s and 1930s as egypt gained independence from british rule in works such as mohamed naghi s painting in the parliament of egypt titled egypt s renaissance and tawfiq al hakim s play the return of the spirit isis symbolizes the revival of the nation a sculpture by mahmoud mokhtar also called egypt s renaissance plays upon the motif of isis s removing her veil 289 isis is found frequently in works of fiction such as a superhero franchise and her name and image appear in places as disparate as advertisements and personal names 290 the name isidoros meaning gift of isis in greek 291 survived in christianity despite its pagan origins giving rise to the english name isidore and its variants 292 in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries isis itself became a popular feminine given name 293 isis continues to appear in modern esoteric and pagan belief systems the concept of a single goddess incarnating all feminine divine powers partly inspired by apuleius became a widespread theme in literature of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 294 influential groups and figures in esotericism such as the hermetic order of the golden dawn in the late nineteenth century and dion fortune in the 1930s adopted this all encompassing goddess into their belief systems and called her isis this conception of isis influenced the great goddess found in many forms of contemporary witchcraft 295 296 today reconstructions of ancient egyptian religion such as kemetic orthodoxy 297 or the church of the eternal source include isis among the deities they revere 298 an eclectic religious organization focused on female divinity calls itself the fellowship of isis because in the words of one of its priestesses m isidora forrest isis can be all goddesses to all people 299 see also traditional african religion portal notes the worship of a particular god such as isis within ancient egyptian religion is termed a cult 10 the same is often true for the worship of individual gods within greek or roman religion classicists sometimes refer to the veneration of isis or of certain other deities who were introduced to the greco roman world as religions because they were more distinct from the culture around them than the cults of greek or roman gods 11 however these cults did not form the kind of independent self contained communities with distinct worldviews that jewish and christian groups in the roman empire did 12 françoise dunand and jaime alvar have both argued that the worship of isis should be called a cult because it formed a part of the wider systems of greek and roman religion rather than an independent all encompassing system of beliefs like judaism or christianity 11 13 originally the first consonant in the name ꜣ was pronounced as r or l by the time of the new kingdom it had weakened to a glottal stop sound and the t at the end of words had disappeared from speech so in the new kingdom the pronunciation of isis s name was similar to usa forms of her name in other languages all descend from this pronunciation 14 the meroitic forms of her name 𐦥𐦣𐦯 wos a or 𐦠𐦯 as a indicate the pronunciation uːɕa 3 these figurines which were common in roman egypt are often thought to depict isis or hathor combined with aphrodite but it is not even certain that they represent a goddess 83 the exposed genitals may represent fertility 82 or be meant to ward off evil 83 scholars have traditionally believed based on the writings of procopius that philae was closed in about ad 535 by a military expedition under justinian i jitse dijkstra has argued that procopius s account of the temple closure is inaccurate and that regular religious activity there ceased shortly after the last date inscribed at the temple in 456 or 457 ce 115 eugene cruz uribe suggests instead that during the fifth and sixth centuries the temple lay empty most of the time but nubians living nearby continued to hold periodic festivals there until well into the sixth century 116 tiberius s expulsion of the egyptian cults was part of a broader reaction against religious practices that were regarded as a threat to order and tradition including judaism and astrology josephus a roman jewish historian who gives the most detailed account of the expulsion says the egyptian cults were targeted because of a scandal in which a man posed as anubis with the help of isis s priests in order to seduce a roman noblewoman sarolta takács casts doubt on josephus s account arguing that it is fictionalized in order to convey a moral point 144 the statue was at a temple in sais neith s cult center she was largely conflated with isis in plutarch s time and he says the statue is of athena neith whom the egyptians consider to be isis proclus version of the quotation says no one has ever lifted my veil implying that the goddess is virginal 172 this claim was occasionally made of isis in greco roman times though it conflicted with the widespread belief that she and osiris together conceived horus 173 proclus also adds the fruit of my womb was the sun suggesting that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity which would mean it referred to egyptian myths about neith as the mother of ra 172 this knot is sometimes called the isis knot although it should not be confused with the tyet symbol which is also sometimes called the knot of isis 206 the mystery rites may have emerged as part of the hellenization of isis under the ptolemies in the third century bce 240 in greece under the influence of the cult of demeter in the first century bce 241 or as late as the first or second century ce 242 even after the initiation ceremony had developed few texts in egypt referred to it 243 early modern illustrations of isis as nature often showed her with multiple breasts originally the form of artemis that was worshipped at ephesus was depicted with round protuberances on her chest that came to be interpreted as breasts early modern artists drew isis in this form because macrobius claimed that both isis and artemis were depicted this way 282 references

that can perform arithmetic operations a modern scientific calculator with a lcd an electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics the first solid state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s pocket sized devices became available in the 1970s especially after the intel 4004 the first microprocessor was developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom modern electronic calculators vary from cheap give away credit card sized models to sturdy desktop models with built in printers they became popular in the mid 1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost by the end of that decade prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools computer operating systems as far back as early unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant pda type devices the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices in addition to general purpose calculators there are those designed for specific markets for example there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line or higher dimensional euclidean space as of 2016 update basic calculators cost little but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more with the very wide availability of smartphones tablet computers and personal computers dedicated hardware calculators while still widely used are less common than

of fractions and decimal equivalents input electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations some even contain 00 and 000 buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button however in more specific calculators a button can perform multi function working with key combinations display output calculators usually have liquid crystal displays lcd as output in place of historical light emitting diode led displays and vacuum fluorescent displays vfd details are provided in the section technical improvements large sized figures are often used to improve readability while using decimal separator usually a point rather than a comma instead of or in addition to vulgar fractions various symbols for function commands may also be shown on the display fractions such as 1 3 are displayed as decimal approximations for example rounded to 0 33333333 also some fractions such as 1 7 which is 0 14285714285714 to 14 significant figures can be difficult to recognize in decimal form as a result many scientific calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or mixed numbers memory calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory basic calculators usually store only one number at a time more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables the variables can also be used for constructing formulas some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers the extended memory address is termed an array index power source power sources of calculators are batteries solar cells or mains electricity for old models turning on with a switch or button some models even have no turn off button but they provide some way to put off for example leaving no operation for a moment covering solar cell exposure or closing their lid crank powered calculators were also common in the early computer era key layout the

results liquid crystal displays lcds vacuum fluorescent displays vfds and light emitting diode led displays use seven segments to represent each digit in a basic calculator advanced calculators may use dot matrix displays a printing calculator in addition to a display panel has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper using a printing mechanism processor chip microprocessor or central processing unit processor chip s contents unit function scanning polling unit when a calculator is powered on it scans the keypad waiting to pick up an electrical signal when a key is pressed encoder unit converts the numbers and functions into binary code x register and y register they are number stores where numbers are stored temporarily while doing calculations all numbers go into the x register first the number in the x register is shown on the display flag register the function for the calculation is stored here until the calculator needs it permanent memory rom the instructions for in built functions arithmetic operations square roots percentages trigonometry etc are stored here in binary form these instructions are programs stored permanently and cannot be erased user memory ram the store where numbers can be stored by the user user memory contents can be changed or erased by the user arithmetic logic unit alu the alu executes all arithmetic and logic instructions and provides the results in binary coded form binary decoder unit converts binary code into decimal numbers which can be displayed on the display unit clock rate of a processor chip refers to the frequency at which the central processing unit cpu is running it is used as an indicator of the processor s speed and is measured in clock cycles per second or hertz hz for basic calculators the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the kilohertz range an office calculating machine with a paper printer example a basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four function calculator to perform the calculation 25 9 one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators 2 5 9 when 2 5 is entered it is picked up by the scanning unit the number 25 is encoded and sent to the x register next when the key is pressed the addition instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or the status register the second number 9 is encoded and sent to the x register this pushes shifts the first number out into the y register when the key is pressed a message signal from the flag or status register tells the permanent or non volatile memory that the operation to be done is addition the numbers in the x and y registers are then loaded into the alu and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non volatile memory the answer 34 is sent shifted back to the x register from there it is converted by the binary decoder unit into a decimal number usually binary coded decimal and then shown on the display panel other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions numeric representation main article binary coded decimal most pocket calculators do all their calculations in binary coded decimal bcd rather than binary bcd is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic and not containing a microprocessor by employing bcd the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub circuit this matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven segment displays to build a metering circuit for example if the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry therefore in cases where the calculations are relatively simple working throughout with bcd can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary for example cds keep the track number in bcd limiting them to 99 tracks the same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor often smaller code results when representing numbers internally in bcd format since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors for these applications some small processors feature bcd arithmetic modes which assist when writing routines that manipulate bcd quantities 3 4 where calculators have added functions such as square root or trigonometric functions software algorithms are required to produce high precision results sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator chip with acceptable calculation time 5 calculators compared to computers this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march 2009 learn how and when to remove this template message the fundamental difference between a calculator and computer is that a computer can be programmed in a way that allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results while calculators are pre designed with specific functions such as addition multiplication and logarithms built in the distinction is not clear cut some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions sometimes with support for programming languages such as rpl or ti basic for instance instead of a hardware multiplier a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in read only memory rom and compute trigonometric functions with the cordic algorithm because cordic does not require much multiplication bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general purpose computers because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity but takes many more clock cycles this distinction blurs with high end calculators which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design more so the z80 mc68000 and arm architectures and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market history precursors to the electronic calculator main article mechanical calculator see also human computer the first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were bones used to tally items pebbles and counting boards and the abacus known to have been used by sumerians and egyptians before 2000 bc 6 except for the antikythera mechanism an out of the time astronomical device development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century the geometric military compass by galileo logarithms and napier bones by napier and the slide rule by edmund gunter 17th century mechanical calculators in 1642 the renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by wilhelm schickard 7 and several decades later blaise pascal 8 a device that was at times somewhat over promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention 9 pascal s calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus if the tedium could be borne multiply and divide by repetition schickard s machine constructed several decades earlier used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation there is a debate about whether pascal or shickard should be credited as the known inventor of a calculating machine due to the differences like the different aims of both inventions 10 schickard and pascal were followed by gottfried leibniz who spent forty years designing a four operation mechanical calculator the stepped reckoner inventing in the process his leibniz wheel but who couldn t design a fully operational machine 11 there were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century 12 the grant mechanical calculating machine 1877 the 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements first by poleni with the first fully functional calculating clock and four operation machine but these machines were almost always one of a kind luigi torchi invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834 this was also the second key driven machine in the world following that of james white 1822 13 it was not until the 19th century and the industrial revolution that real developments began to occur although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible the arithmometer invented in 1820 as a four operation mechanical calculator was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit forty years later by 1890 about 2 500 arithmometers had been sold 14 plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers burkhardt germany 1878 and layton uk 1883 and felt and tarrant the only other competitor in true commercial production had sold 100 comptometers 15 patent image of the clarke graph based calculator 1921 it wasn t until 1902 that the familiar push button user interface was developed with the introduction of the dalton adding machine developed by james l dalton in the united states in 1921 edith clarke invented the clarke calculator a simple graph based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions this allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for inductance and capacitance in power transmission lines 16 the curta calculator was developed in 1948 and although costly became popular for its portability this purely mechanical hand held device could do addition subtraction multiplication and division by the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators although the curta remains a popular collectable item development of electronic calculators the first mainframe computers using firstly vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits appeared in the 1940s and 1950s this technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators the casio computer company in japan released the model 14 a calculator in 1957 which was the world s first all electric relatively compact calculator it did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology and was built into a desk early calculator light emitting diode led display from the 1970s ussr in october 1961 the world s first all electronic desktop calculator the british bell punch sumlock comptometer anita a new inspiration to arithmetic accounting was announced 17 18 this machine used vacuum tubes cold cathode tubes and dekatrons in its circuits with 12 cold cathode nixie tubes for its display two models were displayed the mk vii for continental europe and the mk viii for britain and the rest of the world both for delivery from early 1962 the mk vii was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler mark viii the anita had a full keyboard similar to mechanical comptometers of the time a feature that was unique to it and the later sharp cs 10a among electronic calculators the anita weighed roughly 33 pounds 15 kg due to its large tube system 19 bell punch had been producing key driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names plus and sumlock and had realised in the mid 1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics they employed the young graduate norbert kitz who had worked on the early british pilot ace computer project to lead the development the anita sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available and was silent and quick the tube technology of the anita was superseded in june 1963 by the u s manufactured friden ec 130 which had an all transistor design a stack of four 13 digit numbers displayed on a 5 inch 13 cm cathode ray tube crt and introduced reverse polish notation rpn to the calculator market for a price of 2200 which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time like bell punch friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics in 1964 more all transistor electronic calculators were introduced sharp introduced the cs 10a which weighed 25 kilograms 55 lb and cost 500 000 yen 4555 81 and industria macchine elettroniche of italy introduced the ime 84 to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it but apparently not at the same time the victor 3900 was the first to use integrated circuits in place of individual transistors but production problems delayed sales until 1966 the bulgarian elka 22 from 1967 there followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers including canon mathatronics olivetti scm smith corona marchant sony toshiba and wang the early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors which were cheaper than silicon transistors on multiple circuit boards display types used were crt cold cathode nixie tubes and filament lamps memory technology was usually based on the delay line memory or the magnetic core memory though the toshiba toscal bc 1411 appears to have used an early form of dynamic ram built from discrete components already there was a desire for smaller and less power hungry machines bulgaria s elka 6521 20 21 introduced in 1965 was developed by the central institute for calculation technologies and built at the elektronika factory in sofia the name derives from elektronen kalkulator and it weighed around 8 kg 18 lb it is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function later that same year were released the elka 22 with a luminescent display 20 22 23 and the elka 25 with an in built printer several other models were developed until the first pocket model the elka 101 was released in 1974 the writing on it was in roman script and it was exported to western countries 20 24 25 programmable calculators main article programmable calculator the italian programma 101 an early commercial programmable calculator produced by olivetti in 1964 the first desktop programmable calculators were produced in the mid 1960s they included the mathatronics mathatron 1964 and the olivetti programma 101 late 1965 which were solid state desktop printing floating point algebraic entry programmable stored program electronic calculators 26 27 both could be programmed by the end user and print out their results the programma 101 saw much wider distribution and had the added feature of offline storage of programs via magnetic cards 27 another early programmable desktop calculator and maybe the first japanese one was the casio al 1000 produced in 1967 it featured a nixie tubes display and had transistor electronics and ferrite core memory 28 the monroe epic programmable calculator came on the market in 1967 a large printing desk top unit with an attached floor standing logic tower it could be programmed to perform many computer like functions however the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch goto at the end of the operation stack returning the program to its starting instruction thus it was not possible to include any conditional branch if then else logic during this era the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer the first soviet programmable desktop calculator iskra 123 powered by the power grid was released at the start of the 1970s 1970s to mid 1980s the electronic calculators of the mid 1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an ac power supply there were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuits chips and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development u s semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration lsi semiconductor development squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits this led to alliances between japanese calculator manufacturers and u s semiconductor companies canon inc with texas instruments hayakawa electric later renamed sharp corporation with north american rockwell microelectronics later renamed rockwell international busicom with mostek and intel and general instrument with sanyo pocket calculators pocket calculator redirects here for the song see computer world by 1970 a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries the first handheld calculator was a 1967 prototype called cal tech whose development was led by jack kilby at texas instruments in a research project to produce a portable calculator it could add multiply subtract and divide and its output device was a paper tape 29 30 31 32 33 34 as a result of the cal tech project texas instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators the first commercially produced portable calculators appeared in japan in 1970 and were soon marketed around the world these included the sanyo icc 0081 mini calculator the canon pocketronic and the sharp qt 8b micro compet the canon pocketronic was a development from the cal tech project it had no traditional display numerical output was on thermal paper tape sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in january 1971 the sharp el 8 also marketed as the facit 1111 which was close to being a pocket calculator it weighed 1 59 pounds 721 grams had a vacuum fluorescent display rechargeable nicad batteries and initially sold for us 395 however integrated circuit development efforts culminated in early 1971 with the introduction of the first calculator on a chip the mk6010 by mostek 35 followed by texas instruments later in the year although these early hand held calculators were very costly these advances in electronics together with developments in display technology such as the vacuum fluorescent display led and lcd led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all in 1971 pico electronics 36 and general instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ics a full single chip calculator ic for the monroe royal digital iii calculator pico was a spinout by five gi design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ics pico and gi went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market the first truly pocket sized electronic calculator was the busicom le 120a handy which was marketed early in 1971 37 made in japan this was also the first calculator to use an led display the first hand held calculator to use a single integrated circuit then proclaimed as a calculator on a chip the mostek mk6010 and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries using four aa size cells the le 120a measures 4 9 by 2 8 by 0 9 inches 124 mm 71 mm 23 mm the first european made pocket sized calculator db 800 38 39 was made in may 1971 by digitron in buje croatia former yugoslavia with four functions and an eight digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display the first american made pocket sized calculator the bowmar 901b popularly termed the bowmar brain measuring 5 2 by 3 0 by 1 5 inches 132 mm 76 mm 38 mm came out in the autumn of 1971 with four functions and an eight digit red led display for us 240 while in august 1972 the four function sinclair executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring 5 4 by 2 2 by 0 35 inches 137 2 mm 55 9 mm 8 9 mm and weighing 2 5 ounces 71 g it retailed for around 79 us 194 at the time by the end of the decade similar calculators were priced less than 5 6 85 following protracted development over the course of two years including a botched partnership with texas instruments eldorado electrodata released five pocket calculators in 1972 one called the touch magic was no bigger than a pack of cigarettes according to administrative management 40 the first soviet union made pocket sized calculator the elektronika b3 04 41 was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974 one of the first low cost calculators was the sinclair cambridge launched in august 1973 it retailed for 29 95 41 03 or 5 6 85 less in kit form the sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition however their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental functions 42 meanwhile hewlett packard hp had been developing a pocket calculator launched in early 1972 it was unlike the other basic four function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule the 395 hp 35 along with nearly all later hp engineering calculators uses reverse polish notation rpn also called postfix notation a calculation like 8 plus 5 is using rpn performed by pressing 8 enter 5 and instead of the algebraic infix notation 8 5 it had 35 buttons and was based on mostek mk6020 chip the first soviet scientific pocket sized calculator the b3 18 was completed by the end of 1975 in 1973 texas instruments ti introduced the sr 10 sr signifying slide rule an algebraic entry pocket calculator using scientific notation for 150 shortly after the sr 11 featured an added key for entering pi π it was followed the next year by the sr 50 which added log and trig functions to compete with the hp 35 and in 1977 the mass marketed ti 30 line which is still produced in 1978 a new company calculated industries arose which focused on specialized markets their first calculator the loan arranger 43 1978 was a pocket calculator marketed to the real estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values in 1985 ci launched a calculator for the construction industry called the construction master 44 which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations such as angles stairs roofing math pitch rise run and feet inch fraction conversions this would be the first in a line of construction related calculators adler 81s pocket calculator with vacuum fluorescent display vfd from the mid 1970s the casio cm 602 mini electronic calculator provided basic functions in the 1970s the 1972 sinclair executive pocket calculator the hp 35 the world s first scientific pocket calculator by hewlett packard 1972 canon pocketronic calculator prints output using paper tape 1971 programmable pocket calculators the first programmable pocket calculator was the hp 65 in 1974 it had a capacity of 100 instructions and could store and retrieve programs with a built in magnetic card reader two years later the hp 25c introduced continuous memory i e programs and data were retained in cmos memory during power off in 1979 hp released the first alphanumeric programmable expandable calculator the hp 41c it could be expanded with random access memory ram for memory and read only memory rom for software modules and peripherals like bar code readers microcassette and floppy disk drives paper roll thermal printers and miscellaneous communication interfaces rs 232 hp il hp ib the hp 65 the first programmable pocket calculator 1974 the first soviet pocket battery powered programmable calculator elektronika b3 21 was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977 45 the successor of b3 21 the elektronika b3 34 wasn t backward compatible with b3 21 even if it kept the reverse polish notation rpn thus b3 34 defined a new command set which later was used in a series of later programmable soviet calculators despite very limited abilities 98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers people managed to write all kinds of programs for them including adventure games and libraries of calculus related functions for engineers hundreds perhaps thousands of programs were written for these machines from practical scientific and business software which were used in real life offices and labs to fun games for children the elektronika mk 52 calculator using the extended b3 34 command set and featuring internal eeprom memory for storing programs and external interface for eeprom cards and other periphery was used in soviet spacecraft program for soyuz tm 7 flight as a backup of the board computer this series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter intuitive mysterious undocumented features somewhat similar to synthetic programming of the american hp 41 which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods a number of respected monthly publications including the popular science magazine nauka i zhizn наука и жизнь science and life featured special columns dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches named yeggogology еггогология the error messages on those calculators appear as a russian word yeggog еггог which unsurprisingly is translated to error a similar hacker culture in the usa revolved around the hp 41 which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than b3 34 technical improvements a calculator which runs on solar and battery power through the 1970s the hand held electronic calculator underwent rapid development the red led and blue green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life often measured in hours so rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries were common or were large so that they could take larger higher capacity batteries in the early 1970s liquid crystal displays lcds were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime busicom introduced the busicom le 120a handy calculator the first pocket sized calculator and the first with an led display and announced the busicom lc with lcd however there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale the first successful calculators with lcds were manufactured by rockwell international and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as dataking lc 800 harden dt 12 ibico 086 lloyds 40 lloyds 100 prismatic 500 a k a p500 rapid data rapidman 1208lc the lcds were an early form using the dynamic scattering mode dsm with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background to present a high contrast display these models illuminated the lcd using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide which negated the low power consumption of the display these models appear to have been sold only for a year or two a more successful series of calculators using a reflective dsm lcd was launched in 1972 by sharp inc with the sharp el 805 which was a slim pocket calculator this and another few similar models used sharp s calculator on substrate cos technology an extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology the cos technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards credit card sized solar powered calculator by braun 1987 modern pocket calculator with solar and battery powering in the mid 1970s the first calculators appeared with field effect twisted nematic tn lcds with dark numerals against a grey background though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays the advantage of lcds is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light which require much less power than light emitting displays such as leds or vfds this led the way to the first credit card sized calculators such as the casio mini card lc 78 of 1978 which could run for months of normal use on button cells there were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators all of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first calculator on a chip integrated circuits ics in 1971 but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high many calculators continued to use two or more ics especially the scientific and the programmable ones into the late 1970s the power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced especially with the introduction of cmos technology appearing in the sharp el 801 in 1972 the transistors in the logic cells of cmos ics only used any appreciable power when they changed state the led and vfd displays often required added driver transistors or ics whereas the lcds were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator ic itself with this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cells as the power source realised around 1978 by calculators such as the royal solar 1 sharp el 8026 and teal photon the interior of a casio fx 20 scientific calculator from the mid 1970s using a vfd the processor integrated circuit ic is made by nec marked μpd978c discrete electronic

solar cell the processor is a chip on board type covered with dark epoxy mass market phase at the start of the 1970s hand held electronic calculators were very costly at two or three weeks wages and so were a luxury item the high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices however the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved and the effect of economies of scale was felt by 1976 the cost of the cheapest four function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars about 1 20 of the cost five years before the results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing the firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators or producing high specification scientific and programmable calculators citation needed mid 1980s to present the elektronika mk 52 was a programmable rpn style calculator that accepted extension modules it was manufactured in the soviet union from 1985 to 1992 the first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the hp 28c released in 1987 it could for example solve quadratic equations symbolically the first graphing calculator was the casio fx 7000g released in 1985 the two leading manufacturers hp and ti released increasingly feature laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s at the turn of the millennium the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was not always clear as some very advanced calculators such as the ti 89 the voyage 200 and hp 49g could differentiate and integrate functions solve differential equations run word processing and pim software and connect by wire or ir to other calculators computers the hp 12c financial calculator is still produced it was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes the hp 12c featured the reverse polish notation mode of data entry in 2003 several new models were released including an improved version of the hp 12c the hp 12c platinum edition which added more memory more built in functions and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry calculated industries competed with the hp 12c in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling changing the i pv fv to easier labeling terms such as int term pmt and not using the reverse polish notation however ci s more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present according to mark bollman 46 a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at albion college the construction master is the first in a long and profitable line of ci construction calculators which carried them through the 1980s 1990s and to the present a calculator with a graphical user interface personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator using the graphical user interface to portray a calculator one such example is windows calculator most personal data assistants pdas and smartphones also have such a feature use in education a ti 30xiis scientific calculator used commonly by students a catiga cs 103 scientific calculator in most countries students use calculators for schoolwork there was some by whom initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or elementary arithmetic skills would suffer citation needed there remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations in the head with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained while others concentrate more on teaching estimation methods and problem solving research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in 47 others have argued who that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts 48 in december 2011 the uk s minister of state for schools nick gibb voiced concern that children can become too dependent on the use of calculators 49 as a result the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the curriculum 49 in the united states many math educators and boards of education have enthusiastically endorsed the national council of teachers of mathematics nctm standards and actively promoted the use of classroom calculators from kindergarten through high school see also calculator spelling comparison of hp graphing calculators

was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father s official work as supervisor of taxes at rouen he conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically and developed a design appropriate for this purpose showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life but it was one thing to conceive and design the machine and another to get it made and put into use here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions in a sense pascal s invention was premature in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use this difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by pascal s

their features if not always the cover feature kid eternity was brought in from the start as the new cover feature for hit 2 the character may have been based on the 1941 movie here comes mr jordan in which a prizefighter dies too soon in a plane crash and is given a new life by a celestial guide 3 he proved to be popular enough that when quality comics began expanding their post war line the kid got his own self titled comic book kid eternity in the spring of 1946 4 further illustrating the popularity of the character his antagonists her highness and silk were given their own strip in hit comics 29 through 57 by the late 1940s however quality comics was experiencing the post war bust that most superhero comics were in november 1949 kid eternity s self titled magazine was discontinued with issue 18 and his lead slot in hit comics was given over to jeb rivers a riverboat captain with issue 61 character origin and powers edit the kid was originally a nameless boy who remembered being called only kid by his gran pa who was killed when a u boat sank his grandfather s fishing boat during world war ii due to a supernatural mix up however he was killed 75 years too soon similar to the plot of the 1941 film here comes mr jordan to rectify the error the kid was brought back to life for another 75 years with the mission of upholding good in the world 5 he was given the power to summon any good historical or mythological figure or animal by saying the word eternity as well as to use the same word to make himself material or immaterial and invisible kid eternity was further assisted on his duties by the clerk who d made the error mr keeper he is sometimes shown summoning fictional figures like jean valjean or the witches in macbeth in kid eternity 2 he shows time travel ability

quick scheme 7 their first appearance was in hit comics 27 april 1943 8 they were quickly spun off into their own feature in the next issue her highness was on the cover and their spin off lasted until issue 57 9 in 1982 she and silk appeared in a captain marvel story guest starring kid eternity world s finest 282 master man kid eternity s opposite number master man was given powers similar to the kid s by the devil when master man said stygia he could summon any evil historical or mythological figure from stygia first appearance kid eternity 15 when defeated he was taken back to stygia by the ground opening beneath him but returns later to gather more lost souls thuggoths evil creatures part man part beast who were imprisoned in a pyramid 3000 years ago by the egyptian pharaoh king tut ankh amen but escape and plan to take over the world killing experts on egyptology so it is not known how to kill them kid eternity tracks them to the pyramid is attacked by one but summons up william tell who slays it with an arrow and later summons up tut who finally destroys them with fire he only appears in kid eternity 1 dr marko a world renowned scientist who after being paid by foreign agents to set off radio controlled mines in a city harbour thus killing hundreds of people is sentenced to hanging he decides to travel through time to attack america when it was smaller and weaker and invents a time globe to travel to the past although he takes the kid with him after they realise a mortal is meddling with eternity not realising who he is marko attempts to change history twice but is foiled mr keeper then take marko back to the day of his execution where he is hanged and sends the globe far into the future where men will learn to use its great powers dr marko appeared only

leader of a group of kidnappers who kidnap a rich girl called kathryn the greenbriar heiress and demand a 50 000 ransom the kid foils the kidnappers and saves the girl from a fire in the car even though she was supposed to die that day dc comics edit 1980s edit in the early 1980s another american publisher dc comics decided to revive kid eternity unlike most of the quality stable who were depicted as living on the parallel world earth x kid eternity was retconned into the marvel family of earth s which dc had acquired from another former competitor fawcett comics this change was made because the kid s power bore such a similarity to the marvels after a magic word was spoken and a character who had not been present arrived in a bolt of lightning although unlike the marvels the kid himself did not disappear in this revival the kid was given a new name christopher kit freeman and became the brother of captain marvel jr freddy freeman he is shown to live in the same neighbourhood as shazam and the elders eternity in his first new story he assists captain marvel in battling villains from american history whom doctor sivana has resurrected to cause trouble in philadelphia while he prepares his plan to destroy the city billy batson goes to the pavilion but he is seized by a thug before he can speak he is bound and gagged and taken inside the kid goes there and sees billy but is coshed by the thug he too is bound and gagged and brought inside he and billy are tied back to back and placed under the liberty bell billy removes his gag using benedict arnold s sword as it goes through the crack they defeat sivana after which the kid returns to eternity kid eternity became a supporting character in shazam stories and there was even an eventual rematch with both her highness and silk and later master man kid eternity s powers prove a valuable asset at least once when a villain cast a magical black void around the marvel family in their regular forms thus preventing them from calling down the magic lightning to change although the villains also bound and gagged kid eternity he managed to remove the gag to summon zeus who supplied the magic lightning necessary for the marvel family to change earth s was merged with earths one two 4 and x in crisis on infinite earths and kid eternity vanished along with the original version of the marvel family modern incarnation

affiliationsteen titansabilitiessummoning of demons that emulate historical or mythological figures in the 1990s a different and darker version of the character was introduced this was done with a three issue miniseries written by grant morrison with art by duncan fegredo in 1991 this version returned the kid to his nameless roots and severed ties with the marvel family while it kept most of the original continuity intact it also made some significant changes to the character s backstory when dc began their mature readers vertigo imprint they went back to kid eternity with a new series written by ann nocenti with art by sean phillips this series quickly moved away from the continuity established by morrison and instead focused on the everyman qualities of the character it lasted 16 issues may 1993 september 1994 10 revised origin edit the boat captain the kid referred to as his grandfather is actually a sexual predator who had picked up the young orphaned boy for his own purposes 10 the fishing ship they are on is destroyed by a u boat and the kid is killed the kid arrives at an artificial heaven created by the supernatural lords of chaos who make the kid their unwitting servant by convincing him he had been killed too early and that they would return him to life for the error the kid is given the power to summon people by saying eternity but the people he summons are actually demons who assume the form of the figures he desires he can choose any person or fictional character without regard to good or evil to bring back the lords of chaos give the kid a guide a minor lord of chaos called mr keeper mr keeper who assumes the form of a pudgy overweight human acts as a guide for the kid in setting up and turning on a series of chaos engines which is part

in the opening pages of jsa 1 1999 by the sorcerer mordru who seeks to wipe out all agents of order or chaos sometime after kid eternity later appears in jsa 48 as either a spirit within doctor fate s amulet or a hallucination the story is unclear on this point post infinite crisis edit he returns in teen titans 31 2006 having been used by the newest brother blood to wedge open the doorway between life and death to which he was chained this doorway appears as an actual doorway with life and death written on it as it is seen from beast boy s perspective and that was all his mind is able to comprehend he returns and finally defeats blood who has been plaguing the titans for some time using the souls of all the previous brother bloods and is active once again in the pages of 52 osiris mentions that he helped the kid fight against the keeper who was trying to control the dead in teen titans 68 it is revealed that at some point kid eternity rebelled against the lords of chaos and was almost stripped of his power before the intervention of a lord of order named sister sentry who offered eternity protection but due to mr keeper almost taking his powers kid eternity can now only summon one soul at a time and only for just over 1 minute shown when he used the soul of abraham lincoln to get some free fast food with the soul fading after exactly 66 seconds in teen titans 74 kid eternity is kidnapped by the calculator and forced to summon the spirit of his son marvin white repeatedly the calculator some time later acknowledges kid eternity as burned out without explanation 11 it is later indicated that he was beaten to death by the calculator after he could not get the results he wanted from him 12 the teen titans later learn of kid eternity s death during a confrontation with a robotic duplicate of the calculator who shows them footage and pictures of his murder 13 the new 52 edit kid eternity appeared in a new national comics one shot issue written by jeff lemire and

comics 20 at that time marston wanted to create his own new superhero marston s wife and fellow psychologist elizabeth suggested to him that it should be a woman 21 william moulton marston a psychologist already famous for inventing the polygraph struck upon an idea for a new kind of superhero one who would triumph not with fists or firepower but with love fine said elizabeth but make her a woman marston introduced the idea to gaines given the go ahead marston developed wonder woman whom he believed to be a model of that era s unconventional liberated woman marston also drew

polygraphs convinced him that women were more honest than men in certain situations and could work more efficiently 24 marston designed wonder woman to be an allegory for the ideal love leader the kind of woman who he believed should run society frankly wonder woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who i believe should rule the world marston wrote 25 in a 1943 issue of the american scholar marston wrote 26 not even girls want to be girls so long as our feminine archetype lacks force strength and power not wanting to be girls they don t want to be tender submissive peace loving as good women are women s strong qualities have become despised because of their weakness the obvious remedy is to create a feminine character with all the strength of superman plus all the allure of a good and beautiful woman william moulton marston marston was an outspoken feminist polyamorist and firm believer in the superiority of women 27 28 he described bondage and submission as a respectable and noble practice marston wrote in a weakness for wonder woman which was attached to a fictional stipulation that he dubbed aphrodite s law that made the chaining of her bracelets of submission together by a man take away her amazonian super strength 29 the only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable peaceful human society william moulton marston golden age edit main article golden

storyline the lies for the odd numbered issues and year one for the even numbered issues the new storyline as presented in these issues effectively retcons the events from the previous new 52 series the lies 51 storyline reveals that numerous events from the previous wonder woman series in which diana was made the queen of the amazons and the god of war were in fact all an illusion created by a mysterious villain and she had never once been back to themyscira ever since she left nor is she capable of returning there the year one story is presented as an all new origin story for diana 52

works as curator for the department of antiquities 56 at the extremely prestigious louvre museum and is held in very high esteem by the curator of the gotham city museum of antiquities her tremendously long life span accumulation of immense amount of knowledge and exceptional perceptiveness makes diana prince the wisest and most emotionally intelligent female member of the justice league 57 58 during marston s run diana prince was the name of an army nurse whom wonder woman met the nurse wanted to meet with her fiancé who was transferred to south america but was unable to arrange for money to do so as wonder woman needed a secret identity to look after steve who was admitted to the same army hospital in which diana prince worked and because both of them looked alike wonder woman gave the nurse money to go to her fiancé in exchange for the nurse s credentials and took diana prince as her alias 59 she started to work as an army nurse and later as an air force secretary 59 60 the identity of diana prince was especially prominent in a series published in the early 1970s in which she fought crime only under the prince alias and without her mystic powers to support herself she ran a mod clothing boutique 61 62 the diana prince alias also played an important role after the events of infinite crisis wonder woman was broadcast worldwide killing a villain named maxwell lord as he was mind controlling superman into killing batman when wonder woman caught him in her lasso demanding to know how to stop superman maxwell revealed that the only way to stop him was to kill lord so as a last resort diana snapped his neck 63 64 to recover from the trauma of killing another person the amazon went into a self imposed exile for one year 65 on her return to

agent at the department of metahuman affairs during a later battle with the witch circe a spell was placed on diana leaving her powerless when not in the guise of wonder woman 66 the new 52 continuity did not feature the diana prince identity as series writer brian azzarello stated in an interview 67 however when she and superman began dating for her civilian identity she used the diana prince alias whenever she was around clark kent such as when she introduced herself to lois lane at lois s housewarming party under that name 68 personality edit at last in a world torn by the hatred and wars of men appears a woman to whom the problems and feats of men are mere child s play a woman whose identity is known to none but whose sensational feats are outstanding in a fast moving world she serves as a symbol of integrity and humanity so that the world of men would know what it means to be an amazon with a hundred times the agility and strength of our best male athletes and strongest wrestlers she appears as though from nowhere to avenge an injustice or right a wrong as lovely as aphrodite as wise as athena with the speed of mercury and the strength of hercules she is known only as wonder woman narrator all star comics 8 introducing wonder woman written by william moulton marston many writers have depicted diana in different personalities and tone between both of her diametric extremes that of a worldly warrior a highly compassionate and calm ambassador and sometimes also as a naive and innocent person depending on the writer what has remained in constant existence and is a mainstay of the character is the dichotomy of her dominant force aspect and her nurturing humanity her overwhelming belief in love empathy compassion and having a strong conscience the latter aspect had been the reason for her induction into the star sapphires 69 70 writer gail simone was applauded for her portrayal of wonder woman during her run on the series with comic book reviewer dan phillips of ign noting that she s molded diana into a very relatable and sympathetic character 71 actress gal gadot described wonder woman as an idealist experienced super confident open and sincere even in the midst of a gruesome bloody conflict having many strengths and powers but at the end of the day she s a woman with a lot of emotional intelligence 72 73 in the golden age wonder woman adhered to an amazon code of helping any in need even misogynistic people and never accepting a reward for saving someone 74 while conversely the modern version of the character has been shown to perform lethal and fatal actions when left with no other alternative exemplified in the killing of maxwell lord in order to save superman s life 63 64 brian azzarello stated in an interview that the new 52 version of the character was being written as a very confident impulsive and good hearted character in her he referred to her trait of feeling compassion as both her strength and weakness 75 a distinctive trait of her characterization is a group of signature mythological exclamations beginning with great aphrodite followed by great hera 76 merciful minerva and suffering sappho some of which were contributed by elizabeth holloway marston 77 3 others edit main article alternative versions of wonder woman diana after her death was granted divinity as the goddess of truth by her gods for such faithful devotion 78 during her brief time as a god of olympus diana was replaced in the role of wonder woman by her mother queen hippolyta 79 unlike diana receiving the title of wonder woman in honor hippolyta s role as wonder woman was meant to be a punishment for her betrayal in artemis death as well as for unintentionally killing her own daughter 80 john byrne the writer that introduced the concept of hippolyta as the first wonder woman has explained his intentions in a post in his message board i thought george s one mistake in rebooting wonder woman was making her only 25 years old when she left paradise island i preferred the idea of a diana who was thousands of years old as if i recall correctly she was in the tv series from that angle i would have liked to have seen diana having been wonder woman in ww2 and be returning to our world in the reboot 81 not having that option i took the next best course and had hippolyta fill that role 81 as wonder woman queen hippolyta immediately got involved in a time travel mission back to the 1940s with jay garrick 82 after this mission she elected to join the justice society of america and remained in that era for

protege helena the golden age fury these visits happened yearly from young lyta s perspective and also accounted for hippolyta s participation in the jsa jla team ups when she returned from the past hippolyta took diana s place in the jla as well 84 85 following wonder woman s ascension to heaven and return to the living in infinite frontier she officially gives her blessing for her mother

about the decision to give the amazons heeled sandals jenkins explained that they also have flats for fighting adding it s total wish fulfillment i as a woman want wonder woman to be sexy hot as hell

s legendary shield the aegis to be awarded to her champion the shield was made from the indestructible hide of the great she goat amalthea who suckled zeus as an infant these forearm guards have thus far proven nigh indestructible the omega beams of grail have proven able to shatter them and are able to absorb the impact of incoming attacks allowing wonder woman to deflect automatic weapon fire and energy blasts 214 diana can slam the bracelets together to create a wave of concussive force capable of making strong beings like superman s ears bleed 63 recently she gained the ability to channel zeus s lightning through her bracelets as well zeus explained to her that this power had been contained within the bracelets since their creation because they were once part of the aegis and that he had only recently unlocked it for her use 215 after the 2011 relaunch of the character it was revealed that diana was the daughter of zeus and hippolyta 137 and that the bracelets are able to keep the powers she had inherited from zeus in check 190 in addition hephaestus has modified the bracelets to allow wonder woman the sorcerous ability to manifest a sword of grayish metal from each bracelet each sword marked with a red star takes shape from a flash of lightning and when wonder woman is done with them the swords disappear supposedly back into her bracelets as such she has produced other weapons from the bracelets in this way such as a bow that fires explosive arrows spears and energy bolts among others 216 the inspiration to give diana bracelets came from the pair of bracelets worn by olive byrne creator william moulton marston s research assistant and lover 3 wonder woman and her sister amazons have to wear heavy bracelets to remind them of what happens to a girl

chains of the hitler type beat them and made them work like horses in the fields aphrodite goddess of love finally freed these unhappy girls but she laid down the rule aphrodite s law that they must never surrender to a man for any reason i know of no better advice to give modern day women than this rule that aphrodite gave the amazon girls 217 lasso of truth edit main article lasso of truth the

non canonical batman superman wonder woman trinity 219 during the golden age the original form of the lasso had the power to force anyone caught to obey any command given them even overriding the mind

guardian said yes she is sort of naked a lot of the time but this isn t objectification so much as a cultural reset having thighs actual thighs you can kick things with not thighs that look like arms is a feminist act the whole diana myth women safeguarding the world from male violence not with nurture but with better violence is a feminist act casting robin wright as wonder woman s aunt re imagining the battle axe as a battler with an axe is a feminist act a female german chemist trying to destroy humans in the shape of dr poison a proto mengele before nazism existed might be the most feminist act of all 250 alyssa rosenberg for the washington post said none of these experiences crushed me of course but i do wonder what it might have been like if they hadn t happened the power of wonder woman and one of the things that gives jenkins s adaptation of the character such a lift is in the answer to that question diana prince gal gadot doesn t have any idea what women and men are or aren t supposed to do even when she does encounter other people s ideas about gender roles she doesn t automatically accept them and she never lets anyone stop her and the movie goes a step further and argues that it s not merely little girls all over the world who stand to gain if they can grow up free of the distorting influence of misogyny a world like that would be liberating and wonderful for men in lots of ways too 251 emma gray for huffpost said when it comes to pop culture we speak often about representation the simple yet often unfulfilled idea that it matters to see someone like you fill a variety of imagined roles on screen after awhile these conversations almost begin to feel obvious we know that it s good to see women and people of color and disabled people and trans people and queer people in the same numbers and variety of roles that white cisgender straight men have long been afforded but what these discussions often lose is the emotional impact of finally seeing something you may have never even realized you were missing for many women viewers wonder woman filled a hole they didn t know they had 252 pacifist icon edit gloria steinem editor for ms magazine and a major supporter of wonder woman stated marston had invented wonder woman as a heroine for little girls and also as a conscious alternative to the violence of comic books for boys 253 badower described a near international incident involving an unnamed russian general rolling dozens of tanks and munitions through a shady mountain pass as an outstanding example for standing up to bullies she ends up deflecting a bullet back and disarming the general he says adding that she doesn t actually do anything violent in the story i just think that wonder woman is smarter than that 254 nick pumphrey stated that wonder woman stands as a non violent beacon of hope and inspiration for women and men 255 256 grant morrison stated i sat down and i thought i don t want to do this warrior woman thing i can understand why they re doing it i get all that but that s not what wonder woman creator william marston wanted that s not what he wanted at all his original concept for wonder woman was an answer to comics that he thought were filled with images of blood curdling masculinity and you see the latest shots of gal gadot in the costume and it s all sword and shield and her snarling at the camera marston s diana was a doctor a healer a scientist 257 258 259 260 261 paquette detailed the changes he made to wonder woman s costume stating that he removed the iconic american flag theme and instead incorporated a greek influence the animal associated to aphrodite is a dove so instead of an eagle on wonder woman s breastplate it will be more of a dove it s not the american eagle it s the aphrodite dove stuff that creates the letter w is by accident so it s not like she already has a letter of the alphabet on her costume in the end i ve created a structure so it feels inevitable for wonder woman to look the way she does 262 lgbt icon edit william marston s earliest works were notorious for containing subversive bondage and sapphic undertones subtext among wonder woman s famous catchphrases suffering sappho was a direct reference to lesbianism fredric wertham s seduction of the innocent referred to her as the lesbian counterpart to batman whom he also identified as a homosexual after marston s death in 1947 dc comics downplayed her sexuality and feminist origin wonder woman without marston s creative direction become more traditional superhero fare the lesbian relationships and sexual imagery disappeared from the wonder woman comic along with wonder woman s super powers during the comics code authority decades since wonder woman s subversiveness had been gradually stripped away subsequent comic book writers and artists either didn t know what do with her or barely hinted at wonder woman s erotic legacy 263 but under the new 1987 re boot of the title under the editorship of karen berger and with the writing and art of george perez at the helm of the book the same sex appreciation by wonder woman and the amazons was more than hinted at and this was established quickly in the new run of the title upon her first sight of supporting character vanessa kapatelis in issue 3 she is shown smiling upwards at kapatelis thinking to herself i ve never seen another woman quite like her she s so young so vulnerable so beautiful 264 three years later in the first issue 38 of a new decade there is a story line presenting a cultural exchange between appointed leaders from man s world who are the first mortals to visit themyscira in this continuity and the amazons of themyscira in themyscira itself the guest unitarian minister reverend cantwell asks the amazon mnemosyne don t you miss the sharing god intended for the sexes to which mnemosyne replied some do they have sworn themselves to artemis the virgin hunter and athena the chaste warrior others choose the way of narcissus but most of us find satisfaction in each other three thousand years can be a long time reverend 265 probably more than at any other time in the then nearly fifty year history of the character the amazons were explicitly and unequivocally defined in general as lesbian additionally kevin mayer brother of the major supporting character myndi mayer was openly gay and this was treated sympathetically 266 by this time dc comics was a warner brothers owned company and had been for over 20 years wonder woman is suggested as being queer 267 or bisexual as she and another amazon io had reciprocal feelings for each other 268 grant morrison s 2016 comic wonder woman earth one which exists parallel to the current dc comics rebirth canon diana is depicted being kissed on her right cheek by a blonde woman who has put her left arm around diana 269 in 2016 issue 48 of sensation comics featured wonder woman officiating a same sex wedding drawn by australian illustrator jason badower my country is all women to us it s not gay marriage it s just marriage she states to superman inspired by the 2015 june supreme court ruling that established same sex marriage in all 50 united states badower says dc comics was fantastic about his idea for the issue in an interview with the sydney morning herald he said his editor was like great i love it let s do it it was almost anticlimactic 270 diana s mother the queen at the very least authorized or in some cases officiated these weddings badower says it just seems more like a royal duty diana would take on that she would do for people that would appreciate it 254 wonder woman actress gal gadot reacted positively to diana s rebooted orientation and agreed her sexuality was impacted by growing up in the women only themyscira gadot stated that wonder woman feels she need not be labelled sexually and is just herself she s a woman who loves people for who they are she can be bisexual she loves people for their hearts 271 272 coming from a society that was only populated by women lesbian in the world s eyes may have been straight for them 273 her culture is completely free from the shackles of heteronormativity in the first place so she wouldn t even have any concept of gender roles in sex 274 wonder woman s advocacy for women rights and gay rights was taken a step further in september 2016 when comic book writer greg rucka announced that she is canonically bisexual according to her rebooted rebirth origin 275 276 rucka stated nobody at dc comics has ever said wonder woman gotta be straight nobody ever they ve never blinked at this 273 rucka stated that in his opinion she has to be queer and has obviously had same sex relationships on an island surrounded by beautiful women 277 278 this follows the way wonder woman was written in the alternate continuity or non canon earth one by grant morrison 279 and fellow wonder woman writer gail simone staunchly supported rucka s statement 280 surprised at the amount of backlash from her fanbase rucka responded to haters that consensual sex with women is just as important to wonder woman as the truth is to superman 281 sexual icon edit wonder woman s signature weapon is her lasso of truth consequently much of her crime fighting powers came from bondage and her only exploitable weakness was essentially bondage grant morrison and yanick paquette had teamed up to work on wonder woman earth one 262 wonder woman s sexual and bondage themes in her earliest days were not without purpose however her creator william moulton marston theorized that human relationships could be broken down into dominance submission inducement and compliance roles which were embedded into our psyche because males were more often than not dominant in societies marston believed that women as a sex are many times better equipped to assume emotional leadership than are males 282 marston wanted to convey his progressive ideals through his use of bondage imagery that women are not only capable of leadership roles but should be in charge of society although marston had good intentions with these themes in wonder woman s early appearances the bondage elements were controversial as they were often seen to overly fetishize women in power rather than promote such women noah berlatsky criticized this imagery in wonder woman s earliest days noting that the comics take sensual pleasure in women s disempowerment 283 despite having the mixed messages of this imagery marston fiercely believed that women would soon rule the earth and meant to showcase his predictions through sexual themes in his stories he was an open feminist while studying at harvard where he once said girls are also human beings a point often overlooked 284 see also edit wikiquote has quotations related to wonder woman alternative versions of wonder woman for elseworlds and other characters to bear the title amazons dc comics diana prince

2 one of two members of wonder woman s rogues gallery introduced in the 1940s to have an ice snow motif minister blizzard after the blue snowman who first appeared three years prior was an early progenitor of the comics trope of the ice gun wielding supercriminal 3 preceding more recognizable dc comics antagonists such as mr freeze and captain cold as well as marvel comics blizzard minister blizzard s golden silver and bronze age comics appearances all portray him as a machiavellian politician with chalk white skin bent on plunging the world into a second ice age 4 inevitably bringing him into conflict with wonder woman and her allies his modern age appearances have portrayed him variously as an eco terrorist 5 as well as a fanatical cult leader 6 contents 1 fictional character

and sends the glacier against new york using the holliday girls as hostages to prevent a counterattack wonder woman manages to stop him and then makes peace with snowina while the minister is taken into custody ultimately chemico s invention is not used to change any area of the earth s climate and is largely forgotten about 7 silver bronze age version edit minister blizzard appears next in

are the true mastermind s of what was to be a larger plot to freeze the entire world 9 post crisis edit the post crisis minister blizzard in wonder woman annual vol 3 1 november 2007 art by terry dodson rachel dodson and alex sinclair after dc comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 a publication event known as the crisis on infinite earths wonder woman her supporting cast and her enemies were re imagined though originally absent from this revised mythos minister blizzard would be reintroduced to the wonder woman canon in 2007 by writer allan heinberg as a radical environmentalist bent on invoking another ice age in a plot coordinated by the wicked sorceress circe he teams with a far reaching coalition of wonder woman s adversaries including the cheetah hercules the duke of deception doctor psycho silver swan giganta queen clea angle man doctor poison gundra the valkyrie and the mask 10 the new 52 edit in the new 52 reboot of dc comcs continuity minister blizzard is presented as a cult leader who controls an unnamed group of religious fanatics though the events are unchronicled he was at one point a recurring enemy of the expatriate amazon assassin myrina black 11 dc rebirth edit in the post rebirth continuity minister blizzard attempted to kill billionaire barry o neill during a wintertime seasonal celebration in gotham city seeking to recover a hidden kingdom encased in snow the minister regarded o neill s creation of an ice themed fairy tale children s attraction as a mockery to his holy efforts he was defeated by batman though o neill s murder was soon successfully carried out by the mysterious serial killer collective known as the stag 12 powers abilities and equipment edit minister blizzard carries a gun that fires a beam capable of instantly freezing anything it hits as well as spontaneously generating enormous amounts of ice snow and cold in his earliest appearances his gun produced a mind paralysis ray which could effectively freeze opponents cognition and motor responses as well as scramble their thoughts 13 the minister is capable of propelling himself through the air by using his gun to materialize ice slides which rapidly form beneath and behind his feet similar to the marvel comics mutant superhero iceman additionally the gun appears to be able to formulate moving constructs made of ice and vapor not unlike the hydrokinetic abilities of the dc comics superhero mera though imposing his advanced technology is not his only formidable weapon the minister has consistently demonstrated a cunning capacity for deceitful manipulation whether abusing his position as majordomo by misleading the regent of the icy kingdom from which he hails wholly duping his criminal accomplices captain cold and icicle i or deluding followers as a cult leader minister blizzard s affinity for calculating control has proven as dangerous as his ice gun other versions edit justice league adventures edit based in the dc animated universe minister blizzard is part of a group of ice themed villains called the cold warriors which also consisted of captain cold cryonic man icicle killer frost mr freeze polar lord and snowman he and the rest of the cold warriors tried to overthrow a small african nation only to be thwarted by the justice league 14 super friends edit based in the super friends universe minister blizzard is part of a group of ice

brilliant scientist as well as a brilliant capitalist who uses the vastness of her intelligence and wealth for both philanthropy and personal gain she has been consistently written as a character

by greg rucka and drew johnson 2 rucka stated his intent was to create a lex luthor for diana 3 she deeply resents wonder woman whom she believes does not deserve society s high esteem as a paragon of feminism underpinning this acrimony is a deep seated envy of her enemy s power and stature cale wishes in vain that she too could be a wonder woman 4 after the dc comics 2016 continuity reboot known as rebirth veronica cale has featured prominently in the reformulated origins of several of wonder woman s foes including the silver swan and doctor cyber her plots against wonder woman have also brought her into league and conflict with several other members of the hero s rogues gallery such as the cheetah circe doctor psycho and deimos and phobos she maintains an ongoing association with colonel marina maru the post rebirth doctor poison who serves as one of her chief criminal operatives fictional character biography edit dr veronica cale is a founding partner with her friend leslie anderson in cale anderson pharmaceuticals 5 having grown up in poverty ridden dallas her mother encouraged her to read and towards education before dying of cancer veronica decided to confront her father now a wealthy man living in houston he was coerced out of a sizable amount of money but his marriage career and reputation were not tarnished veronica used the money to enter harvard university at the age of sixteen when she was 21 she had three phds in medical sciences three years later she made the foundation of her fortune having worked hard to get to this position she resents wonder woman for finding acceptance in man s world so easily much like lex luthor s resentment of superman s status in metropolis and finds her message of peace simplistic reasoning that it is easy to preach an end to conflict if you are a superstrong demi goddess when diana writes reflections a study of amazon philosophy cale uses selected quotations from the book to spin the media against her 6 when the book s most outspoken critic loses a debate she arranges to have him killed at a demonstration making it look like the book s proponents are responsible she also uses doctor psycho to inflame both crowds 7 cale is subsequently bound gagged and locked in a closet by psycho who impersonates her for a brief period 7 before she is rescued by wonder woman this does not change her opinion of the superheroine but does have an influence on dr anderson which cale finds worrying 8 9 she is later coerced by circe and the gorgon medusa into aiding in their vendetta against wonder woman and applying for legal guardianship of circe s daughter lyta as a way of removing lyta from the amazon island of themyscira the process is stopped midway through once ares kidnaps lyta from the island leaving circe to abandon her scheme with cale 10 11 this story plot was to have a larger part in the wonder woman comic but was dropped due to the infinite crisis storyline cale s reaction to the media furor surrounding wonder woman s killing of maxwell lord and its consequences have not been recorded cale also played a role in the creation of the third silver swan vanessa kapatelis by buying her from sebastian ballesteros the then current cheetah and turning her into a cyborg to fight wonder woman although anderson was then hired to cure kapatelis by extracting the cybernetic components 52 edit cale resurfaces in week 26 of 52 as one of the abducted scientists on oolong island and the only female among the group 12 and suffers a breakdown after unleashing the four horsemen upon the black marvel family when black adam starts his worldwide crusade for vengeance her conflicting feelings cause her to seduce the mentally unstable will magnus when black adam actually arrives on the shores of oolong island she attempts to take the blame for it walking out to confront the maddened adam she is subsequently entirely ignored 13 according to author notes in the fourth volume of the collected 52 editions cale was supposed to originally die at this point casually slain by black adam further discussion changed her fate subsequently cale leads the remaining mad scientists to form an independent collective their first problem is the return of the four horsemen of apokolips cale ingests a semi organic containment unit and uses it to absorb the horsemen s essences she is later seen undergoing an operation to remove the unit 14 15 she is later seen in the pages of doom patrol being assisted by i q 16 dc rebirth edit veronica cale is reintroduced in the dc rebirth universe as leader of the mysterious organization called godwatch in this timeline cale remains the radically successful corporation head who built her multi million dollar business with her best friend adrianna anderson 17 this time around she was more than willing to ignore the exploits of one she disregarded as that bubble busted supermodel whose edicts of peace through love cale wrote off as a lie thinking affection only made things worse instead of the other way around 18 later on she finds the soul of her daughter isadore had been stolen by deimos and phobos twin sons of ares the gods promise to restore her to normalcy only if cale obtains knowledge of themyscira s location as part of the rebirth reboot wonder woman realizes she does not know the location of themyscira it was taken from her precisely to prevent minions of ares from learning it to either free their master or kill him and take his station cale spends several years attempting to manipulate wonder woman into remembering where to find it in her first attempt adrianna anderson her best and closest associate is killed and cale creates an artificial intelligence based on her brain patterns which renames itself dr cyber 19 cale is also indirectly responsible for barbara ann minerva s cursed betrothal to the misogynistic plant deity urzkartaga she provided the archaeologist with funding and encouragement for her expedition at the behest of her own cruel patrons while cyber engineered localized catastrophes to prevent wonder woman from learning when her friend was in danger needing the power of another deity s avatar to breach the barrier cordoning paradise from the rest of the world thus giving birth to the cheetah 19 realizing that ares s sons would not keep their end of the bargain cale struck a pact with the ancient witch circe to bind the two and make them subservient to her first tricking wonder woman into a false flag operation so the enchantress could siphon enough power to cast said terror gods into the forms of two doberman pinschers unfortunately for cale ares himself had taken her daughter s soul from them and cale would still need to find him and free him to get her back 20 it was

normal world with her soul intact due to ares having freed her from his sons the only way for her to remain whole was to go to themyscira which is mystically linked with ares s prison 23 heartbroken and bitter cale returns home knowing she will never see her daughter again and finds she is under fbi investigation for godwatch s activities a vengeful cheetah then attacks cale but wonder woman intervenes 24 dr cyber ensures the investigation yields no results and wonder woman confronts cale asking her to help remove the cheetah s curse but cale refuses 25 still nursing a grudge against the champion of the gods cale would secretly fund a menagerie of new supervillainesses coming out of the woodwork while remaining clean of their larceny as her nemesis came to her in search of answers veronica simply replied that she enjoyed the joust in spite of this wonder woman knew full well that these attacks across washington were all a covert means of shoring lucrative defense contracts while also pursuing a personal vendetta against the amazon the latter connecting the ties said rogues have to the company mogul based on many of their facilities were supported by re purposed stolen xeno technology provided by the amoral corporate executive 26 later on as malefic gods from the dark multiverse would make their presence known across the planet cale would be contacted by the a i of her former friend dr cyber about the disappearance of barbara minerva the cheetah veronica was somewhat surprised by the return of her digital contemporary after she did everything to keep her out of cale anderson pharmaceuticals mainframe but was more intrigued by the prospect of having cheetah back as a research subject after she nearly killed veronica the last time they met 27 it was when the evil deities presence could be felt by the more religious or supremacy sensitive individuals in the world that cheetah would escape her confinement by cale s technical specialists while seeking to destroy her would be owner but was saved by wonder woman at the last second just before veronica could be thrown from her own office building after the cataclysm caused by the war god ares had enraptured the mythical plane while veronica found herself employing the greek deity of vengeance nemesis using her both as an employee of empire industries and a new means of discrediting wonder woman by filing lawsuit for superpowers to be registered as typical citizens working 9 to 5 citizenship 27 it was not until later that the relationship between man and god was revealed to be inverse that nemesis was using cale for her own ends 28 ends that wonder woman put to a close by embracing the vindictive scientist using empathy and not her fists she realized that her adversary was acting out of fear and despair when realizing that themyscira and the portion of the sphere of the gods which it gravitated around had vanished recently cale feared the worst as it meant that her daughter had disappeared alongside it 29 diana reaffirmed her oath that no harm would come to isadore while living amongst the amazons by actively seeking out her homeland which now that the mysticism barring her from return was no more allowed for mass transit too and from paradise again assuming it can be found as good as to her word and at risk of revealing her birthplace to her archenemy veronica was reunited with her beloved scion albeit a bit surprised at how much she had grown since last she saw her 30 the rebirth version of veronica cale is a far more competent character than her pre flashpoint counterpart manipulating wonder woman and her allies for years finding ways of triumphing over gods and better at mixing business with criminal endeavor she is also far more complex while still holding diana in contempt for much the same reasons as she did in prior continua cale was content to ignore her until deimos and phobos put cale and diana at odds she hates the olympians for the loss of her daughter and her best friend blaming the amazon for bringing her religious insanity into their lives yet by the same token was truly heartbroken at the loss of her business partner and initially felt remorse for her role in dr minerva s transformation into the cheetah her progressive characterization would grow more callous and vindictive using both her resources and intellect to further personal gain by arming potential adversaries to the demigoddess in order to secure even greater profit at her hated enemy s expense both financially and in a misotheistic sense powers and

deodato 1 fictional character history edit amazon tribe background edit as described in her comic book appearances artemis was born an amazon as a member of the egyptian tribe of bana mighdall who migrated from greece to various european and middle eastern countries before finally settling in egypt 2 three thousand years ago the two amazon queens hippolyta and antiope split the amazon nation in two hippolyta s tribe traveled to the isolated island of themyscira otherwise known as paradise island to live immortal lives in order to protect the doorway to the underworld called doom s doorway antiope s tribe was never given immortality and were forced to mate with common men in order to guarantee their tribe s survival over the centuries as they had renounced their olympian gods once the two queens parted ways they eventually began to assimilate various religions and goddesses from the many lands they traveled to some of those included the goddesses isis mammitu bast and neith it was in egypt that they finally built the city of bana mighdall which in their language translates to the temple of women 3 thanking the amazons for their worship one of their new goddesses created a powerfully consistent sandstorm to surround and protect their city from any outsiders who could not be trusted or ariadnas the bana mighdallian amazons eventually began an uneasy trade with outside cities in order to create commerce they would exchange custom made weapons and their warrior skills for goods and slaves for breeding enter artemis edit over the centuries the bana mighdallian weapons and services became above par and were in much demand this way of living continued until the late 20th century it was into this period that artemis was born as a child artemis was raised in poverty among her tribe running naked through barren hills and often hungry 4 by the time she was 10 years old she was trained to carry 50 lbs packs silently across night battlefields 5 at one point in her teens she briefly left her people to find a new life in man s world allying with ra s al ghul as he launched a plan to decimate the world with stolen nuclear missiles acquired with the aid of a salvaged bizarro claiming to be eighteen rather than fourteen and proving herself as a trained warrior by defeating several of ra s forces after being defeated by batman although her ability to hold her own against him when she was only fourteen was still impressive artemis eventually turned against ra s after leading him to themyscira with the intention of allowing him to use it as a base realising during the attack that she could not cause the deaths of her own people she returned home after being inspired by a brief meeting with superman opting to return to a life of relative tranquility 6 eventually wonder woman found their city while searching for the villain the cheetah who had stolen her golden lasso of truth 7 as the bana mighdallian s original themyscirian language had changed over time to incorporate middle eastern dialects diana had a hard time communicating with the newly found amazons eventually a battle took place between her and the bana mighdallian s chief warrior or shim tar soon an enraged olympian god hermes who was in love with diana took vengeance on the desert amazons for attacking his beloved and the city of bana mighdall was destroyed 8 homeless the remaining amazons eventually took up with the witch circe who was a nemesis of wonder woman 9 it was agreed that in exchange for their servitude during the events of the war of the gods circe would grant them immortality and a new home to call their own 10 it was decided that since the themyscirian princess was the initial cause of their city being destroyed they would take over her amazon city instead though only fourteen years of age at this time artemis spoke before the queen and council to protest the planned attack as she felt that amazons must not war against each other 11 her cries were ignored and the attack was undertaken 1 amazons united edit during the attack on themyscira the witch circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into a dimension of demons in order for both tribes to be destroyed 10 the two tribes put aside their rivalry temporarily and fought the demons in order to ensure the amazon survival though only a few months passed in the real world the time the amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted ten years discovering that circe had made her island home disappear wonder woman forced her to return it to its rightful place 12 once this was done wonder woman learned about the invasion the demon war and the amazon truce she eventually met artemis who was now in her mid 20s the two got off to a rocky start but diana could see that artemis heart was true wonder woman edit artemis as wonder woman and diana in alternate costume illustration by mike deodato due to being in the demon dimension queen hippolyta began to see visions of the future one of those visions included wonder woman dying keeping this to herself she called for a new contest for the title of wonder woman claiming that she felt that diana had proven inadequate in the role despite diana s insistence that the world outside was more complicated than they had imagined initially excluding the new amazons queen hippolyta submitted to a vote on the whole to include them at diana s behest through some mystical managing on hippolyta s part artemis eventually won the contest and became the new wonder woman 13 hippolyta then declared to both tribes that she considered artemis her own daughter for winning the contest and during her entire tenure as wonder woman artemis wore diana s tiara as gifts to aid her in her new mission artemis was given several magical objects the gauntlet of atlas which increased its wearer s strength by ten times the sandals of hermes which gave the gift of speed and flight 14 and the golden lasso of truth which forced anyone tied by it to speak only the truth 15 see also the challenge of artemis although artemis tried diligently to distinguish herself from her predecessor in both new york city and boston this proved to be rather hard to do her approach to various situations were often seen as more violent than beneficial because of this and due to man s world s respect of diana artemis often would receive the cold shoulder from those she tried to help extending even to her brief time in the justice league 16 superman once commented to diana that batman refused to allow artemis to sit in diana s chair during justice league meetings 17 diana s twin sister donna troy even showed resentment toward artemis carrying the wonder woman title which caused their first meeting to escalate into a heated argument 18 she later met a representative from a public relations company who agreed to help artemis with her public likeability what artemis was not aware of was that the company with the help of the white magician had set up several battles for her with superhuman men however she ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and abused women 19 once she uncovered this truth she set about to prove herself by single handedly taking down boston s biggest mob boss julianna sazia unable to capture julianna artemis destroyed her army of robots and sazia s booby trapped mansion later artemis arrogance gained the better of her and she died in a battle with the white magician who gained extreme power while accidentally being transported to hell thus queen hippolyta s vision of wonder woman dying came true 1 although ironically diana still died for a time shortly after artemis death hippolyta had used a spell to slightly weaken diana during the contest and her weakened strength resulted in her losing a crucial fight requiem edit after artemis s death as wonder woman her soul was sent to a form of hell while in the underworld artemis became a figurative bride to one of the thirteen ruling princes of hell named dalkriig hath 20 as his bride artemis became part of dalkriig hath s legion of demonic warriors 21 eventually artemis was able to kill dalkriig hath and regain access to the world of the living wanting to separate herself from her former title as wonder woman artemis used her skills learned in tartarus to her advantage and joined a group of demon hunting heroes called the hellenders based in waverly pennsylvania she was assigned the codename javelin which she quickly rejected for the name requiem artemis developed a romantic interest in fellow hellender sure shot a master of arsenal and projection weapons this interest was dropped though when she discovered that sure shot s perceived self assuredness was brought on by psychotropic drugs which were meant to keep various hellender members fearless while battling the likes of demons and ghouls she also befriended a woman by the name of henrietta jessup who went by the codename sojourner though sojourner did not have any warrior skills to speak of artemis stood by her friend and tutored her as a novice amazon for unknown reasons artemis left the hellenders and aided diana in gateway city as a fellow crime fighter 22 she also became close friends with cassie sandsmark artemis previous teacher mentor relationship with sojourner was later expanded as wonder woman asked artemis to take cassie on as a new pupil it was with artemis amazon training lessons that cassie was able to hone her skills in becoming the new wonder girl 23 later still artemis teacher mentor resume would expand even more to even include the combat training of supergirl 24 it was during the initial meeting with supergirl that artemis would gain her revenge against batman for his hostile attitude towards her when she attempted to join the justice league artemis pinned batman in hand to hand combat but was eventually subdued with one of batman s tranquilizer darts 25 the underworld demon belyllioth who served as master over some of the myrmidon demons later contacted artemis to inform her of an unrest in tartarus 26 with the death of the demon dalkriig hath the remaining twelve princes of hell were battling for dominion over the dead demon s realm as dalkriig hath s widow artemis was by rights next in line to rule his region of hades artemis ended the demonic war by presenting herself before the twelve demon rulers to officially be granted her former husband s station after the blessing ceremony was given artemis revealed that the blessing was actually given to belyllioth who was magically disguised in artemis form angered by her deception the twelve princes of hell vowed vengeance against artemis upon her return to hades fortunately for artemis her devoted friend belyllioth now officially one of the thirteen rulers of tartarus has sworn her allegiance and protection to the amazon for eternity during john byrne s time on the wonder woman comic he insinuated that artemis previously had an affair with the new god kanto 27 this fell out of established history as no prior connection of artemis or the amazons to apokolips had been established until darkseid s invasion of themyscira shortly after artemis death because of this the only other time artemis could have met kanto would have been before the banas invaded paradise island leaving artemis to be between infancy to fourteen years of age thus she would have been much too young to have had a relationship with the grown adult shim tar edit after some time artemis returned to themyscira to aid her amazon sisters in the uneasy living conditions they continued to work in due to lingering animosities between the two tribes civil war eventually broke out between the two groups of amazons leaving artemis to take up the title of her tribe s chief warrior or shim tar 28 she did this in the hopes of ending the war and to guide both tribes to peaceful negotiations as shim tar artemis battled queen hippolyta who was acting as the newest wonder woman during their battle artemis reminded hippolyta that the themyscirian queen was not given the armor of wonder woman out of honor but rather as a punishment for causing the death of not only artemis but of her daughter diana as well ultimately coming to her senses hippolyta finally forgave the amazons of bana mighdall for their previous transgressions and joined her daughter diana on the battlefield together queen hippolyta and princess diana renounced their crowns leaving the island without a structured government in the hopes of ending the needless slaughter brought on by the war they were successful and artemis and the themyscirian general philippus were later voted to be co rulers of the island philippus was given the title of chancellor and archon eponymous whereas artemis was given the title of polemarch 29 30 it is explained that archon eponymous equates to the civic office of a presidential title whereas the position of polemarch translates to war leader similar to the position of commander in chief as co ruler artemis helped usher in a new age for the amazons by inviting outworlders to commune on themyscira this included both earth bound peoples as well as alien races 29 together with her people artemis learned about advanced alien technology and new battle skills not all those contacted met the invitation warmly the u s government posted warships along the u s themyscira border later the american president jonathan vincent horne called a meeting with artemis philippus and diana he had his white house chief of staff mr ables inform them that the u s government would ease the blockade if the amazons agreed to transfer blueprints on how to create their own purple ray the trio gave a firm no as an answer telling the president that they feared the u s government would use the purple ray as a weapon because of this tensions between the two nations remained 30 amazon disappearance edit through the machinations of an a i satellite called brother eye a military strike was made against themyscira in an attempt at amazon genocide a large swarm of omac units were sent to the island and began to attack the amazons as part of the events of infinite crisis 31 because of this as well as the many previous attacks against the island since diana had become wonder woman it was decided by artemis and philippus that the entire island of themyscira and all of its inhabitants sans diana would be transported to a hidden dimension via the olympian and bana mighdallian goddesses 32 artemis and the remaining amazons thrive in this dimension for a year s time in peace 33 the witch circe later entered the amazons protected dimension and revived queen hippolyta from death 34 circe informed the amazons that diana was being illegally detained by the u s government and tortured until she gave them the secrets of the purple ray because of this the amazons agreed to give hippolyta her royal title back and followed her instructions to invade washington d c which brought about the events of amazons attack artemis and philippus were assigned to oversee the battle but soon lost faith in hippolyta when they discovered some of her actions against man s world proved to be less than honorable due to their failure to follow through in stopping hippolyta during the war a disguised granny goodness cursed all of the amazons by erasing their memories and scattering them across the globe with false personas 35 under her false persona artemis then is shown wearing civilian travel clothes near the great wall of china 36 with the return of the olympian gods zeus revives the amazon s memories several months after their memory wipes and has them return to themyscira 37 artemis is not shown to be part of the returning amazons though instead artemis is kidnapped during her memory loss period by the slave leader mr smyth 38 by the time her memory is returned to her she finds herself shackled drugged and placed in a copy of her former requiem costume while she is his captive smyth drugs tortures and attempts to brainwash artemis which she is able to resist through force of will she is freed by the sympathizing banshee villain jeannette artemis then learns that she and other amazons of bana mighdall have been captured and sent to smyth s devil s island by the u s government due to the war crimes they committed against the united states during the events of amazons attack despite this artemis convinces several members of the mercenary team secret six to aid her in also freeing her fellow amazons after this is accomplished smyth is killed by a member of secret six before artemis could exact her revenge upon him once freed artemis and the remaining amazons gathered their dead and were provided a magical transport back to themyscira where they were greeted by hippolyta and philippus 39 upon return of the island artemis discovers the amazons are now ruled by achilles and the mad amazon alkyone she takes immediate issue with themyscira s newly structured monarchy 40 artemis helps organize a party to dethrone alkyone and is surprised to discover that achilles and his people are more than willing to help in the coup 41 the coup is successful and a new government structure is created for the island once again dc rebirth edit an alternate version of artemis is later introduced in the new dc comics universe as part of red hood and the outlaws along with bizarro born as a full fledged amazon to another amazon and raised in bana mighdall artemis was trained from a very young age to be the shim tar in addition to her enhanced amazon strength and fighting skills she also possesses an overly large sized battle axe that contains magical properties which also appears when artemis calls upon it artemis initially meets red hood in a train car where black mask sends red hood to steal a powerful weapon supposedly the ancient bow of ra also looking for the bow of ra both artemis and red hood instead discover that the weapon they find is a clone of superman the two take in the clone and attempt to civilize the childlike superman clone which red hood dubs bizarro over time artemis begins to show a romantic affection for red hood and a motherly affection for bizarro when wonder woman is mentioned artemis displays a dislike for her it is later revealed that the two amazons come from different tribes diana being themyscirian and artemis being from bana mighdall when bana mighdall was destroyed diana was there to rescue artemis from the rubble despite this aid artemis held a grudge against the themyscirian amazons for being distant from the splintered tribe now out on her own in man s world artemis forms a bond with red hood and agrees to aid him and bizarro on some of their assignments through these adventures artemis steadily keeps track of the bow of ra s location finally discovering that it was transported to qurac following the bow s trail she discovers that her best friend and former lover the amazon akila has returned from the dead and is now in possession of the bow of ra akila tries to explain to artemis that her plans to destroy qurac with it is an honorable feat due to qurac s prior assault on bana mighdall artemis struggles with her loyalties before siding against akila telling her that the station of shim tar is above the act of human genocide defeating her artemis becomes the new holder of the bow of ra and default shim tar to the remaining amazons of bana mighdall she leaves her people though to remain teammates with red hood and bizarro in gotham city artemis is also revealed to have selected grace to be her alias surname 42 jason and artemis shared a kiss but felt they should stay friends powers and abilities edit artemis has superhuman level strength able to rip through steel 43 superhuman speed and reflexes she is a master hand to hand fighter combining many assimilated fighting techniques and is a weapons expert in both the use and manufacturing of weapons favoring bow and arrows but ranging from blades to automatic weapons due to the result of a spell cast by amazonian mystic magala artemis possesses and has retained a great deal of diana s overall physical dynamism which should ve dissipated after the contest of the mantle of wonder woman had passed yet it still persists to this day 44 artemis has eternal youth which was provided by the witch circe to her and the rest of her bana mighdall sisterhood 10 this form of immortality does not provide resistance from harm or even death 45 she possesses knowledge of low level sorceries learned in the underworld including self transmogrification using the phrase punji baal t alemi dar baharin to change into another person creature and then saying the spell backward to return to her true form this requires a lot of one s life force energy 26 spell reversal which she used to transform demonically transformed were creatures back into their human forms 20 46 demonic sensing allowing her to know when a demon is masking their appearance as that of a human 5 as of the dc rebirth comics

artemis was as strong or stronger than she was and wearing all the symbols of an ancient amazon warrior artemis appearance was influenced by two other comic book characters wildcats member zealot a kherubim and a coda warrior zealot is the immortal former majestrix of the all female warriors called the coda and helped develop their virtues and practices after failing to follow her own rules

february 1971 7 the character has continued to appear as a main villain in dc comics having faced renowned superheroes such as superman and batman and is now widely considered the greatest enemy of the justice league 8 fictional character biography edit darkseid in infinite crisis secret files 1 march 2006 art by dan jurgens layouts art thibert cam smith jerry ordway and nelson decastro finishes prince uxas the son of king yuga khan and queen heggra and the second in line to the throne of apokolips plotted to seize control over the planet from his older brother drax 9 when drax attempted to claim the fabled omega force uxas murdered him and claimed its power for himself his skin turned to stone uxas rechristened himself as darkseid 10 11 12 13 at some point he fell in love with an apokoliptian scientist and sorceress named suli with whom he had a son kalibak however heggra ordered desaad to poison suli out of the belief that she was corrupting her son following suli s death darkseid s heart grew even colder and his disdain for his mother intensified when she forced him to marry a woman named tigra with whom he had another son orion seeking vengeance against heggra for killing the one he loved darkseid ordered desaad to poison her so he could finally become the supreme monarch of apokolips darkseid then tried to force tigra to eliminate orion but the latter was ultimately traded with highfather s son scott free as part of a peace treaty between the warring planets of apokolips and new genesis 14 this trade eventually became a setback for darkseid with orion growing up to value and defend the ideals of new genesis as a powerful champion in opposition to his father the prophecy foretold that darkseid would meet his final defeat at the hands of orion in a cataclysmic battle in the fiery armaghetto of apokolips likewise darkseid and his training minion granny goodness were unable to break scott free s spirit after a long torturous upbringing and free ultimately managed to escape apokolips taking with him the mightiest of the female furies big barda as his wife free now known as the superhero mister miracle and barda began living on earth and darkseid used this betrayal as a pretext to declare the treaty with new genesis abrogated so the planets could resume their conflict seeing other deities as a threat darkseid invaded the island of themyscira in order to discover the secret location of the olympian deities planning to overthrow the olympians and steal their power refusing to aid darkseid in his mad quest the amazons battled his parademon troops causing half of the amazon population s death 15 16 17 wonder woman was able to gain her revenge against darkseid for killing so many of her sisters by placing a portion of her own soul into darkseid this supposedly weakened the god s power as he lost a portion of his dark edge 18 19 darkseid s goal was to eliminate all free will from the universe and reshape it into his own image to this end he sought to unravel the mysterious anti life equation which gives its user complete control over the thoughts and emotions of all living beings in the universe darkseid had tried on several other occasions to achieve dominance of the universe through other methods most notably through his minion glorious godfrey who could control people s minds with his voice he had a special interest in earth as he believed humans possess collectively within their minds most if not all fragments of the anti life equation darkseid intended to probe the minds of every human in order to piece together the equation this has caused him to clash with many superheroes of the dc universe most notably the kryptonian superman darkseid worked behind the scenes using superpowered minions in his schemes to overthrow earth including working through intergang a crime syndicate which employs apokoliptian technology and later morphed into a religious cult that worships darkseid as the god of evil the great darkness saga edit main article the great darkness saga one thousand years in the future darkseid has been absent for centuries and is almost completely forgotten he returns and comes into conflict with that era s champions the legion of super heroes after using both scientific and magical methods to enhance his power darkseid transposes the planets apokolips and daxam which places daxam under a yellow sun and gives each of its inhabitants kryptonian like superpowers equal to those of superman placing the daxamites under his mental thrall he uses them in a massive attempt to conquer the known universe however he is eventually defeated by the legion and many of its allies 20 21 22 23 24 25 the seven soldiers and boss dark side edit in grant morrison s 2005 mister miracle limited series it was revealed that darkseid had finally discovered the anti life equation which he then used to destroy the fourth world altogether the new gods fled to earth where they hid highfather and his followers were now a group of homeless people metron used a wheelchair the black racer was an old white man in a wheelchair desaad was an evil psychiatrist granny goodness was a pimp or madam for the female furies and darkseid himself was now an evil gang leader who is referred to only as boss dark side it is revealed that darkseid actually gave the sheeda north america in return for aurakles earth s first superhero 26 this was in turn purely in order for darkseid to get shilo norman whom he considers the avatar of freedom in his clutches so that he could eventually destroy the new gods final crisis edit main article final crisis as prophesied orion returns to earth via boom tube for his final battle with darkseid during the massive fight orion ultimately kills him by ripping his heart out which created a firepit of apokolips from darkseid s chest cavity in reference to the prophecy of their final battle as darkseid dies a battered wounded orion walks away from the battlefield having won the battle against his father once and for all however darkseid s life essence endured even the death of his body and fell back in time where he was reborn as boss dark side aided by his resurrected minions and the supervillain libra once again bound to the form of a human boss dark side began to appear in a number of titles in the run up to final crisis in the flash vol 2 240 he led an army of fanatics their will broken by the spoken form of the anti life equation to kidnap the tornado twins in birds of prey 118 he runs his dark side club where superhumans fight to the death brainwashed by drugs produced by bernadeth in teen titans 59 it was revealed that he had employed the terror titans to capture the teen titans and use them in his club fights in final crisis darkseid has begun to take over earth and corrupt the multiverse with the aid of his herald libra a reborn supervillain and antichrist like figure who soon converts much of the secret society of super villains to his cause with the aid of the crime bible and the holy lance darkseid is also joined by the souls of his fellow evil new gods who like darkseid now possess either modified human bodies or the bodies of other superpowered beings such as mary marvel darkseid also arranges for detective dan turpin to be lured into the dark side club where turpin is turned into darkseid s final host as his boss dark side body has begun to mummify due to darkseid s foul astral presence with his legion of followers and allies aiding him as he undergoes his latest rebirth darkseid successfully conquers the earth with the unleashing of the anti life equation onto mankind however the rebirthing process is still far from complete as dan turpin s mind and soul while corrupted by darkseid s essence still remains in firm control over his body however at the same moment shilo norman the embodiment of freedom is shot by s h a d e operatives thus signalling the victory of evil darkseid wins control over turpin s body now twisted in a close copy of his apokoliptan former appearance and wearing an updated version of his battle armor darkseid then gains the fullest of his power his fall having the effect of compressing and crumpling spacetime around earth after escaping from captivity batman shoots darkseid with the same radion bullet that killed orion while darkseid simultaneously hits batman with the omega beam sending back in time and then infecting batman with omega energy that will cause him to jump forward in time with disastrous results when he reaches the present darkseid is mortally wounded but not before his omega sanction teleports batman into prehistoric times remains believed to be batman s later revealed to be the last of the many batman clones that darkseid created are found by superman who confronts darkseid as darkseid mocks his old enemy for failing to defend earth it emerges that in darkseid s fall through the multiverse he created a doomsday singularity that now threatens all of existence when superman attempts to physically assault him darkseid reveals that he now exists inside the bodies of all those who fell to the power of the anti life equation and that killing darkseid will kill humanity darkseid then reloads the gun that was used to shoot him to kill orion by way of firing the bullet backwards in time a move superman deems to be suicide due to the paradoxical nature of his actions the bullet used to kill orion is ultimately fired at him by batman and is now poisoning him to death before darkseid can use the omega effect to kill superman barry allen and wally west lead the black racer to darkseid and making contact with him frees turpin from darkseid s control wonder woman having been freed from possession by one of darkseid s minions then uses her lasso of truth to bind darkseid s spirit form effectively freeing humanity from the anti life equation and being controlled by darkseid in his final effort darkseid s disembodied essence appears and tries to seize the miracle machine superman has created however superman uses counter vibrations to destroy him furthermore the last piece of darkseid s plan fails when batman thanks to the actions of the new batman dick grayson red robin tim drake robin damian wayne and the justice league is able to return safely to the present consuming the omega energy in his body without damaging the time stream further thus becoming the second individual along with mister miracle to escape the omega sanction doctor impossible later manipulates the crime syndicate of america into helping him resurrect darkseid via a machine that draws energy from the multiverse itself the resurrection backfires and instead creates a new being known as the omega man 27 the new

by him when he severely hurts superman with his omega beams and breaks green lantern s arm 32 finally in justice league 6 darkseid is driven out when cyborg activates the invaders mother boxes and

an intense battle the anti monitor fuses the black racer with flash and sends it after darkseid using the fused flash and his own powers he kills darkseid with darkseid dead the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its god of evil later lex luthor would be merged with the omega sanction becoming the new ruler of apokolips after killing the anti monitor using an anti life equation powered steve trevor grail would later resurrect darkseid through the newborn child of superwoman the child has the same powers as his father mazahs with the ability to steal the powers of others stealing the new god abilities of the justice league grail fuses them with the child and brings darkseid back to life however he is under her complete control grail later attempts to redeem herself by seemingly killing darkseid with the anti life equation however it is later revealed that she reincarnated him back as a baby with the intention of teaching him differently dc rebirth edit darkseid as a baby appears in dc universe rebirth 1 where grail tells him of wonder woman s long lost brother jason baby darkseid reappears in dark nights metal where it is shown that batman stole him from grail and

olympian god destroying their surroundings in their brawl when they take a boom tube to manila philippines zeus grabs onto darkseid and unleashes bolts of lightning on him however darkseid reveals that he planned for this and that his true target was zeus himself and he begins to drain and kill him restoring darkseid back to his original self when the rest of the justice league arrive darkseid

infinite frontier era as a result of the multiverse being expanded into an omniverse darkseid is trapped in earth omega he regained his original form by fusing with all his various selves across the multiverse which he declares are all lesser darkseid without an alternate in any other universe he becomes prime darkseid darkseid s former henchmen eventually reunite with him on earth omega and remain by his side as he gains a new follower named x tract a version of cameron chase from the original earth two 43 powers and abilities edit as a new god darkseid is among the most powerful beings in the dc universe with immortality immense strength and many abilities his best known and most used ability is shooting omega beams from his eyes powered by a cosmic energy source called the omega effect the beams are an intense form of heated energy that can act as a concussive force can disintegrate organisms or objects can cause a target to have never existed and can resurrect fallen beings killed by them during the final crisis darkseid used his omega beams to grant power to mary marvel and her powers afterwards were based on anti life rather than magic darkseid has pinpoint control of this energy and can direct the beams to travel in straight lines curve around corners and even pass through matter or other forms of energy some super powered beings such as superman and doomsday can resist the beams although in the case of superman with a great deal of pain orion and diana were able to deflect them firestorm once used his powers to redirect them and in a crossover story galactus was unaffected by them darkseid sometimes uses the beams to punish those who fail him but are too valuable to kill outright darkseid can teleport himself or others through time and space 44 his omega sanction traps organisms in a series of alternate realities in which they die upon their death they are resurrected in a new reality in which they die in a worse and more painful manner than the previous darkseid is depicted as immensely strong he has effortlessly broken a green lantern ring with his bare hands easily overpowered two kryptonians at once and defeated the entire justice league

he can increase his physical size his true form as a new god being almost incomprehensibly massive 47 darkseid has powers of telepathy and telekinesis and he can create psionic avatars 48 in the great darkness saga darkseid displayed a range of deity like powers such as transposing the positions of two planets in different solar systems taking mental control of the entire population of a planet instantly absorbing all the information from another being s mind pronouncing a curse manifesting the worst fears of other beings as realities and easily defeating incredibly powerful beings such as mon el mordru and the time trapper he has also displayed godly abilities by sensing the death of his son orion 49 and fluctuations of the energy of the godwave 46 darkseid is a highly skilled hand to hand combatant who has been trained in the art of war on apokolips combining his superhuman powers with his combat skills makes him one of the strongest beings in the dc universe he is proficient in the use of various weapons even though he rarely uses them due to other powers like the omega beams despite darkseid s extraordinary physical powers he rarely engages himself personally in confrontations as he prefers to use his superhuman intellect to manipulate or control others to his ends 50 as the ruler of apokolips darkseid has access to all of its military and technological resources while darkseid is a deity and immortal having lived for several hundred thousand years he is not invincible and has been killed on several occasions 50 darkseid is able to drain the life force of other godly beings to rejuvenate himself or return to his full power demi gods are capable of slowly rejuvenating darkseid but a god such as zeus can return darkseid back to his original form by draining the demi gods 42 vague other versions edit darkseid makes his first official appearance in chapter 22 of the injustice gods among us comic on apokolips he is seen overseeing the torture of

of the hyena family skeleton museum of osteology hyenas or hyaenas from ancient greek ὕαινα hýaina 1 are feliform carnivoran mammals of the family hyaenidae haɪˈɛnɪdiː with only four extant species each in its own genus it is the fifth smallest family in the carnivora and one of the smallest in the class mammalia 2 despite their low diversity hyenas are unique and vital components of most african ecosystems 3 although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids as part of suborder feliformia hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent evolution both hyenas and canines are non arboreal cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws both eat food quickly and may store it and their calloused feet with large blunt nonretractable claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns however hyenas grooming scent marking defecation habits mating and parental behavior are consistent with the behavior of other feliforms 4 hyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt in some cultures hyenas are thought to influence people s spirits rob graves and steal livestock and children 5 other cultures associate them with witchcraft using their body parts in traditional african medicine 6

further reading 7 external links evolution edit origins edit hyenas originated in the jungles of miocene eurasia 22 million years ago when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal the first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern african civet one of the earliest hyena species described plioviverrops was a lithe civet like animal that inhabited eurasia 20 22 million years ago and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the middle ear and dentition the lineage of plioviverrops prospered and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws a direction similar to that taken by canids in north america 7 hyenas then diversified into two distinct types lightly built dog like hyenas and robust bone crushing hyenas although the dog like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago with one taxon having colonised north america they became extinct after a change in climate along with the arrival of canids into eurasia of the dog like hyena lineage only the insectivorous aardwolf survived while the bone crushing hyenas including the extant spotted brown and striped hyenas became the undisputed top scavengers of eurasia and africa 7 rise and fall of the dog like hyenas edit skull of ictitherium viverrinum one of the dog like hyenas american museum of natural history the descendants of plioviverrops reached their peak 15 million years ago with more than 30 species having been identified unlike most modern hyena species which are specialised bone crushers these dog like hyenas were nimble bodied wolfish animals one species among them was ictitherium viverrinum which was similar to a jackal the dog like hyenas were numerous in some miocene fossil sites the remains of ictitherium and other dog like hyenas outnumber those of all other carnivores combined the decline of the dog like hyenas began 5 7 million years ago during a period of climate change exacerbated by canids crossing the bering land bridge to eurasia one species chasmaporthetes ossifragus managed to cross the land bridge into north america being the only hyena to do so chasmaporthetes managed to survive for some time in north america by deviating from the endurance running and bone crushing niches monopolized by canids and developing into a cheetah like sprinter most of the dog like hyenas had died off by 1 5 million years ago 7 bone crushing hyenas edit by 10 14 million years ago the hyena family had split into two distinct groups dog like hyenas and bone crushing hyenas the arrival of the ancestral bone crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built family percrocutidae the bone crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids which wiped out the dog like hyenas though they never crossed into north america as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily borophaginae by 5 million years ago the bone crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of eurasia primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by sabre toothed cats one genus pachycrocuta was a 200 kg 440 lb mega scavenger that could splinter the bones of elephants 7 with the decline of large herbivores by the late ice age pachycrocuta was replaced by the smaller crocuta 7 rise of modern hyenas edit skeletons of a striped hyena left and a spotted hyena right two species of the bone crushing hyenas the four extant species are the striped hyena hyaena hyaena the brown hyena parahyaena brunnea the spotted hyena crocuta crocuta and the aardwolf proteles cristata the aardwolf can trace its lineage directly back to plioviverrops 15 million years ago and is the only survivor of the dog like hyena lineage its success is partly attributed to its insectivorous diet for which it faced no competition from canids crossing from north america it is likely that its unrivaled ability to digest the terpene excretions from soldier termites is a modification of the strong digestive system its ancestors used to consume fetid carrion 7 the striped hyena may have evolved from hyaenictitherium namaquensis of pliocene africa striped hyena fossils are common in africa with records going back as far as the villafranchian as fossil striped hyenas are absent from the mediterranean region it is likely that the species is a relatively late invader to eurasia having likely spread outside africa only after the extinction of spotted hyenas in asia at the end of the ice age the striped hyena occurred for some time in europe during the pleistocene having been particularly widespread in france and germany it also occurred in montmaurin hollabrunn in austria the furninha cave in portugal and the genista caves in gibraltar the european form was similar in appearance to modern populations but was larger being comparable in size to the brown hyena 8 the spotted hyena crocuta crocuta diverged from the striped and brown hyena 10 million years ago 9 its direct ancestor was the indian crocuta sivalensis which lived during the villafranchian 10 ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from rivals on carcasses thus forcing them to operate in teams spotted hyenas evolved sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars therefore they did not need to wait for their prey to die and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers they began forming increasingly larger territories necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan s turf 7 spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the middle pleistocene and quickly colonised a very wide area from europe to southern africa and china 10 with the decline of grasslands 12 500 years ago europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands spotted hyenas under these circumstances would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans who were as much at home in forests as in open lands and in highlands as in lowlands spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20 000 years ago completely disappearing from western europe between 11 and 14 thousand years ago and earlier in some areas 11 genera of the hyaenidae extinct and recent edit a spotted hyena of subfamily hyaeninae the list follows mckenna and bell s classification of mammals for prehistoric genera 1997 12 and wozencraft 2005 in wilson and reeders mammal species of the world for extant genera 13 the percrocutids are in contrast to mckenna and bell s classification not included as a subfamily into the hyaenidae but as the separate family percrocutidae though they are generally grouped as sister taxa to hyenas 14 furthermore the living brown hyena and its closest extinct relatives are not included in the genus pachycrocuta but in the genus parahyaena the protelinae aardwolves are not treated as a separate subfamily but included in the hyaeninae family hyaenidae subfamily incertae sedis tongxinictis 15 middle miocene of asia subfamily ictitheriinae herpestides

description striped hyena description aardwolf description and brown hyena description striped hyena skull note the disproportionately large carnassials and premolars adapted for bone consumption aardwolf skull note the greatly reduced molars and carnassials rendered redundant from insectivory hyenas have relatively short torsos and are fairly massive and wolf like in build but have lower hind quarters high withers and their backs slope noticeably downward towards their rumps the forelegs are high while the hind legs are very short and their necks are thick and short their skulls superficially resemble those of large canids but are much larger and heavier with shorter facial portions hyenas are digitigrade with the fore and hind paws having four digits each and sporting bulging pawpads 24 like canids hyenas have short blunt non retractable claws 25 their pelage is sparse and coarse with poorly developed or absent underfur most species have a rich mane of long hair running from the withers or from the head 24 with the exception of the spotted hyena hyaenids have striped coats which they likely inherited from their viverrid ancestors 7 their ears are large and have simple basal ridges and no marginal bursa 25 their vertebral column including the cervical region are of limited mobility hyenas have no baculum 26 hyenas have one more pair of ribs than canids do and their tongues are rough like those of felids and viverrids 27 males in most hyena species are larger than females 28 though the spotted hyena is exceptional as it is the female of the species that outweighs and dominates the male also unlike other hyenas the female spotted hyena s external genitalia closely resembles that of the male 29 their dentition is similar to that of the canid but is more specialised for consuming coarse food and crushing bones the carnassials especially the upper are very powerful and are shifted far back to the point of exertion of peak pressure on the jaws the other teeth save for the underdeveloped upper molars are powerful with broad bases and cutting edges the canines are short but thick and robust 26 labiolingually their mandibles are much stronger at the canine teeth than in canids reflecting the fact that hyenas crack bones with both their anterior dentition and premolars unlike canids which do so with their post carnassial molars 30 the strength of their jaws is such that both striped and spotted hyenas have been recorded to kill dogs with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin 31 32 the spotted hyena is renowned for its strong bite proportional to its size but a number of other animals including the tasmanian devil are proportionately stronger 33 34 the aardwolf has greatly reduced cheek teeth sometimes absent in the adult but otherwise has the same dentition as the other three species 35 the dental formula for all hyena species is 3 1 4 13 1 3 1 although hyenas lack perineal scent glands they have a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening large anal glands above the anus open into this pouch several sebaceous glands are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them 25 these glands produce a white creamy secretion that the hyenas paste onto grass stalks the odor of this secretion is very strong smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning and can be detected by humans several meters downwind 36 the secretions are primarily used for territorial marking though both the aardwolf 7 and the striped hyena 37 will spray them when attacked behavior edit spotted hyena cubs at their den brown hyena cub standing on a path of stones hyenas groom themselves often like felids and viverrids and their way of licking their genitals is very cat like sitting on the lower back legs spread with one leg pointing vertically upward however unlike other feliforms they do not wash their faces they defecate in the same manner as other carnivora though they never raise their legs as canids do when urinating as urination serves no territorial function for them instead hyenas mark their territories using their anal glands a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids but not canids and felids 38 when attacked by lions or dogs striped 39 and brown hyenas 40 will feign death though the spotted hyena will defend itself ferociously 32 the spotted hyena is very vocal producing a number of different sounds consisting of whoops grunts groans lows giggles yells growls laughs and whines 41 the striped hyena is comparatively silent its vocalizations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling 42 whoop of a spotted hyena in umfolosi game park south africa mating between hyenas involves a number of short copulations with brief intervals unlike canids who generally engage in a single drawn out copulation 38 spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed with their eyes open and erupting incisors and canines though lacking adult markings 43 in contrast striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings closed eyes and small ears 44 hyenas do not regurgitate food for their young and male spotted hyenas play no part in raising their cubs 38 though male striped hyenas do so 45 the striped hyena is primarily a scavenger though it will also attack and kill any animals it can overcome 39 and will supplement its diet with fruit 46 the spotted hyena though it also scavenges occasionally is an active pack hunter of medium to large sized ungulates which it catches by wearing them down in long chases and dismembering them in a canid like manner the aardwolf is primarily an insectivore specialised for feeding on termites of the genus trinervitermes and hodotermes which it consumes by licking them up with its long broad tongue an aardwolf can eat 300 000 trinervitermes on a single outing 7 spotted hyenas may kill as many as 95 of the animals they eat 47 while striped hyenas are largely scavengers 39 generally hyenas are known to drive off larger predators like lions from their kills despite having a reputation in popular culture for being cowardly 39 hyenas are primarily nocturnal animals but sometimes venture from their lairs in the early morning hours with the exception of the highly social spotted hyena hyenas are generally not gregarious animals though they may live in family groups and congregate at kills 48 spotted hyenas are one of the few mammals other than bats known to survive infection with rabies virus 49 and have showed little or no disease induced mortality during outbreaks in sympatric carnivores despite this perceived unique disease resistance little is known about the immune system of spotted hyenas 50 51 52 53 and even less is known about other hyaenidae species relationships with humans edit folklore mythology and literature edit cave hyena crocuta crocuta spelaea painting found in the chauvet cave in 1994 a depiction of the legendary striped hyena krokottas of kytheros island from the nile mosaic of palestrina spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate it is often difficult to know whether spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories particularly in west africa as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names in western african tales spotted hyenas are sometimes depicted as bad muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the beng in côte d ivoire citation needed in east africa tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth while west african folklore generally shows the hyena as symbolizing immorality dirty habits the reversal of normal activities and other negative traits in tanzania there is a belief that witches use spotted hyenas as mounts 54 in the mtwara region of tanzania it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will be likely to grow up to be a thief in the same area hyena feces are believed to enable a child to walk at an early age thus it is not uncommon in that area to see children with hyena dung wrapped in their clothes 55 the kaguru of tanzania and the kujamaat of southern senegal view hyenas as inedible and greedy hermaphrodites a mythical african tribe called the bouda is reputed to house members able to transform into hyenas 56 a similar myth occurs in mansôa these werehyenas are executed when discovered but do not revert to their human form when killed 55 striped hyenas are often referred to in middle eastern literature and folklore typically as symbols of treachery and stupidity 57 in the near and middle east striped hyenas are generally regarded as physical incarnations of jinns 54 arab writer al qazwīnī 1204 1283 spoke of a tribe of people called al ḍabyūn meaning hyena people in his book ajā ib al makhlūqāt he wrote that should one of this tribe be in a group of 1000 people a hyena could pick him out and eat him 57 a persian medical treatise written in 1376 tells how to cure cannibalistic people known as kaftar who are said to be half man half hyena 54 al damīrī in his writings in ḥawayān al kubrā 1406 wrote that striped hyenas were vampiric creatures that attacked people at night and sucked the blood from their necks he also wrote that hyenas only attacked brave people arab folklore tells of how hyenas can mesmerise victims with their eyes or sometimes with their pheromones 57 in a similar vein to al damīrī the greeks until the end of the 19th century believed that the bodies of werewolves if not destroyed would haunt battlefields as vampiric hyenas that drank the blood of dying soldiers 58 the image of striped hyenas in afghanistan india and palestine is more varied though feared striped hyenas were also symbolic of love and fertility leading to numerous varieties of love medicine derived from hyena body parts among the baluch and in northern india witches or magicians are said to ride striped hyenas at night 54 the striped hyena is mentioned in the bible the arab word for the hyena ḍab or ḍabu plural ḍibā is alluded to in a valley in israel known as shaqq ud diba meaning cleft of the hyenas and wadi abu diba meaning valley of the hyenas both places have been interpreted by some scholars as being the biblical valley of tsebo im mentioned in 1 samuel 13 18 the modern hebrew word for hyena is tzavoa which is similar to the word tsavua meaning colored though the authorized king james version of the bible interprets the term ayit tsavua which appears in jeremiah 12 9 as speckled bird henry baker tristram argued that it was most likely a hyena being mentioned 59 the vocalization of the spotted hyena resembling hysterical human laughter has been alluded to in numerous works of literature to laugh like a hyæna was a common simile and is featured in the cobbler s prophecy 1594 webster s duchess of malfy 1623 and shakespeares as you like it act

attacks on humans edit illustration from fraser s magazine showing an artist s impression of a stag hound biting a spotted hyena attacking its master a 1739 advertisement by charles benjamin incledon featuring feliforms the mesopotamian lion from the vicinity of bassorah cape lion tiger from the east indies panther from buenos aires hyaena hyaena from west africa and leopard from turkey besides a man tyger from africa the advertisement mentions that the hyaena can mimic a human voice to lure humans in ordinary circumstances striped hyenas are extremely timid around humans though they may show bold behaviors towards people at night 60 on rare occasions striped hyenas have preyed on humans among hyenas only the spotted and striped hyenas have been known to become man eaters hyenas are known to have preyed on humans in prehistory human hair has been found in fossilized hyena dung dating back 195 000 to 257 000 years 61 some paleontologists believe that competition and predation by cave hyenas crocuta crocuta spelaea in siberia was a significant factor in delaying human colonization of alaska hyenas may have occasionally stolen human kills or entered campsites to drag off the young and weak much like modern spotted hyenas in africa the oldest alaskan human remains coincide with roughly the same time cave hyenas became extinct leading certain paleontologists to infer that hyena predation was what prevented humans crossing the bering strait earlier 62 hyenas readily scavenge from human corpses in ethiopia hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup 63 and the red terror 64 hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviors towards living people hyena attacks on people in southern sudan increased during the second sudanese civil war when human corpses were readily available to them 65 although spotted hyenas have been known to prey on humans in modern times such incidents are rare however attacks on humans by spotted hyenas are likely to be underreported 66 man eating spotted hyenas tend to be very large specimens a pair of man eating hyenas responsible for killing 27 people in mulanje malawi in 1962 weighed in at 72 kg 159 lb and 77 kg 170 lb after being shot 67 a 1903 report describes spotted hyenas in the mzimba district of angoniland waiting at dawn outside people s huts to attack them when they opened their doors 68 victims of spotted hyenas tend to be women children and sick or infirm men theodore roosevelt wrote in 1908 1909 in uganda that spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of african sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps 69 spotted hyenas are widely feared in malawi where they have been known to attack people at night particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside a spate of hyena attacks were reported in malawi s phalombe plain with five deaths recorded in 1956 five in 1957 and six in 1958 this pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed attacks occurred most commonly in september when people slept outdoors and bush fires made the hunting of wild game difficult for the hyenas 66 68 a 2004 news report stated that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas in a 12 month period in mozambique along a 20 km stretch of road near the tanzanian border 66 in the 1880s a hyena was reported to have attacked humans especially sleeping children over a three year period in the iğdır province of turkey with 25 children and 3 adults being wounded in one year the attacks provoked local authorities into announcing a reward of 100 rubles for every hyena killed further attacks were reported later in some parts of the south caucasus particularly in 1908 instances are known in azerbaijan of striped hyenas killing children sleeping in courtyards during the 1930s and 1940s in 1942 a sleeping guard was mauled in his hut by a hyena in qalıncaq golyndzhakh cases of children being taken by hyenas by night are known in southeast turkmenistan s bathyz nature reserve a further attack on a child was reported around serakhs in 1948 70 several attacks have occurred in india in 1962 9 children were thought to have been taken by hyenas in the town of bhagalpur in the bihar state in a six week period 59 and 19 children up to the age of four were killed by hyenas in karnataka in 1974 71 a survey of wild animal attacks during a five year period in the indian state of madhya pradesh reported that hyenas had attacked three people causing fewer deaths than wolves gaur boar elephants tigers leopards and sloth bears 72 hyenas as food and medicine edit hyenas are used for food and medicinal purposes in somalia 73 although they are considered haraam in islam 74 this practice dates back to the times of the ancient greeks and romans who believed that different parts of the hyena s body were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility 54 references edit notes edit ὕαινα henry

rays of the sun in x the exterminator black vulcan was shown saying in his pants because the ray was aimed at harvey s groin area he claims that he previously used the name supervolt before aquaman

search person who manages zoo animals for other uses see zookeeper disambiguation a zookeeper with south american sea lions at the paris zoological park a zookeeper sometimes referred as animal keeper is a person who manages zoo animals that are kept in captivity for conservation or to be displayed to the public 1 they are usually responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals as part of their routine the zookeepers may clean the exhibits and report health problems they may also be involved in scientific research or public education such as conducting tours and answering questions contents 1 background 2 duties and responsibilities 3 educational requirements 4 internships and volunteer work 5 notes and references 6 external links background edit animal collections requiring wild animal care takers or zookeepers have existed since about 3 000 b c 2 early civilizations in mesopotamia present day iraq egypt china and pakistan northwest india allowed rulers and the wealthy class citizens to keep collections of wild animals these civilizations had individuals who caught and cared for wild animals such as fish and birds 2 king hammurabi babylonia 1728 1686 bc established the first known code of laws which included fees that could be charged by ox and ass doctors or what we know today as veterinarians 2 some ancient collections of animals were very large and contained a wide variety of species although specific details of these collections were not recorded many cultures such as the chinese egyptians persians greeks arabian and india collected little is known about how or where they kept these animals or even what the animals were our knowledge comes from when these animals appeared in the processionals parades or in the arena fights however there is proof that large elephant exhibits were maintained outside of rome there is also proof of people who cared for the sick animals veterinarians 2 in the areas known as the new world aztec and inca societies also maintained large animal collections while these were only discovered in the early 16th century they were much older than that montezuma mexico city had the largest known collections one collection consisted of birds and required some 300 keepers another collection consisted of mammals and reptiles requiring another 300 keepers there were also fresh and salt water fish ponds 2 duties and responsibilities edit zookeepers with a cheetah at australia zoo a zookeeper s responsibilities usually include feeding maintaining and cleaning the animals diet preparation behavioral observation record keeping exhibit maintenance and providing environmental enrichment for the animals in their care 3 some also conduct behavioral or reproductive research on a species and participate in public education through talks programs or shows they are expected to clean enclosures every day they look for any signs of injuries or illness in the animals and in the case of sickness or injury the keeper is responsible for contacting a veterinarian and sometimes a zookeeper will assist a veterinarian some zookeepers train the animals to make caring for them easier for example a zookeeper can train an elephant to lift their feet so that a veterinarian can check them more easily 4 some zookeepers are responsible for informing an audience in an exhibit or presentation about certain types of animals and their behavioral characteristics they also talk about experiences with the animal and answer questions the keeper is also responsible for lecturing the visiting public on how to behave responsibly toward the exhibited animals depending on the zoo structure keepers may be assigned to work with a broad group of animals such as mammals birds or reptiles or they may work with a limited collection of animals such as primates large cats or small mammals traditionally the live exhibits were often organized by taxonomy resulting in clusters of carnivores cages bird aviaries primate exhibits and so on which led to sections within a zoo cared for by specialized staff 5 some keepers can become highly specialized such as those who concentrate on a specific group of animals like birds great apes elephants or reptiles modern habitat exhibits attempt to display a diversity of species of different animal classes within one enclosure to represent ecosystem concepts groups of enclosures are organized by themes relating to for example zoogeography and bioclimatic zones rather than taxonomy the shift in exhibit arrangements is changing the scope of work for animal keepers as they become habitat keepers with a necessary working knowledge of living environment care including landscape maintenance plant care climate control and expanded knowledge of animals husbandry for many more species across taxonomic classes 5 educational requirements edit the educational requirements for an entry level zoo keeper vary in the usa they are often required to have completed a college degree in zoology biology wildlife management animal science or some other animal related field some colleges offer programs oriented towards a career in zoos job advancement is also possible but more limited than in some other careers requiring a college degree in other institutions keepers are required to have finished a full apprenticeship as craftsmen before receiving special training for their task as animal keeper in fact in many european countries people intending to keep or take care of wild animals need to be licensed this license will only be given if they can prove sufficient knowledge and practical abilities evidence of competence of course in the vast array of zoos in the world some of them are still privately owned amateur facilities with a lack of well trained personnel in contrast some zoos in australia have a strong reliance on dedicated part time volunteer workers who assist zookeepers in the simpler tasks such as preparation of foods and medicines and cleaning of animal enclosures internships and volunteer work edit in the usa in addition to good academic preparation most zoos prefer to hire people for zookeeping positions who have prior animal handling experience there are a wide variety of internships that aspiring zoo keepers can take both during and after college many of these internships can be found by going to a local zoo or aquarium 6 other internships can be found in an animal related facility including vet hospitals humane society shelters wildlife rehabilitation centers farms and stables internships are an opportunity for individuals who are considering a career in animal welfare to learn more about companion animals and their behaviors notes and references edit hurwitz jane choosing a career in animal care world of
