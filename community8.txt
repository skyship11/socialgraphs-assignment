first encountered batman it was batman who first revealed to francine that kirk had mutated himself into the feral man bat at one point batman had captured the man bat and tried to give him an antidote to his condition but the man bat fought him at every turn he even tried bringing francine to the batcave in the hopes that she could convince langstrom to take the antidote willingly kirk escaped however and when he next reunited with francine forced her to take the same bat gland extract that he had taken as proof of her love and devotion to him although francine was terrified she knew that somewhere within the man bat s insanity lay the soul of the man she loved francine took the serum and like kirk mutated into a creature with bat like qualities the two man bats decided to marry one another at their wedding they donned latex masks to disguise their features but batman interrupted the ceremony and exposed them in front of all their guests batman fought against francine and kirk and was finally able to defeat them by using the cathedral s bells to incapacitate them upon doing so batman administered his cure to both of them turning them back to normal a few months later the langstroms traveled to las vegas nevada to study a rare breed of vampire bat that had surfaced following underground nuclear tests in new mexico while examining one of the bats francine pricked her finger on a fang and the toxin activated the dormant man bat gene that still resided in her body she transformed into a monster once again but this time with more vampiric characteristics including enhanced strength in this iteration francine could only transform into a she bat during the nights of the full moon an uncontrollable savage francine began terrorizing the streets of las vegas biting victims upon the neck and drinking their blood when news of her rampage reached gotham city batman believed that it was kirk langstrom who had become the man bat he flew out to vegas and fought the she bat on the roof of a vegas casino after the initial fight batman deduced that his opponent was not kirk langstrom at all but francine finding kirk the two tracked francine to a cave where batman ensnared her with his batrope he then administered the same antidote he had used in the past and francine was once again cured this treatment did not last long however a year later a professor of medieval history from antioke university known as baron tyme used his sorcery to take control of francine turning her back into the she bat he had francine attack and kill a former colleague of his named professor raymond arthur kirk langstrom became the man bat again and used hypnosis to break baron tyme s hold over her kirk defeated tyme and the sorcerer apparently died in his tower chamber when the room caught on fire batman consulted with langstrom about his wife s condition and insisted that he give francine a full blood transfusion kirk brought francine to his home town of chicago where she lived with him at the lakeshore manor apartments he kept a steady vigil over her condition and fortunately for them both the blood transfusion appeared to have cured her the langstroms had two children rebecca and aaron while rebecca was a normal human excluding the times when her whole family was mutated into man bats aaron was born a mutant bat creature due to the serum in his parents systems she also served as the lead scientist for the outsiders to help them with their missions in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe francine langstrom is reimagined as a more villainous character in this new timeline she met kirk as a research assistant and supposedly loved him for his conviction in developing the man bat serum for curing deafness when kirk transformed into the man bat to help cure the city of the man bat epidemic she decided to bring kirk back so he could perfect the formula for its original purpose then she would take the formula herself and transform into the she bat with some reported deaths kirk began to think that he lacked control over the beast but he discovered that francine s man bat formula differentiated from his as the bat she used was a south american vampire bat it is revealed that francine only married kirk to ensure the company that he would complete the serum and then have him killed so she could inherit a large sum of money she developed her own serum after kirk turned into the man bat in order to keep her job kirk tried to help cure her but she preferred her new form and attacked kirk but ultimately refused to kill him kirk combined the two serums in order to become a stronger beast and defeat francine and francine mocked him by acknowledging that he could only beat her by becoming like her she is later charged for the murders that she committed as the she bat 20 she is later released from arkham by the penguin and sent to attack harley quinn demonstrating that she has much better control over her transformation than kirk does she injects the man bat formula into harley and her friend tony to turn them into man bats however harley ultimately regains control over herself after francine threatens harley s friends and defeats the she bat 21 francine langstrom in other media edit francine langstrom appears in media set in the dc animated universe voiced by meredith macrae introduced in batman

lionel luthor smallville edit lillian portrayed by alisen down had a long and prolific role in the tv series smallville lillian came from a wealthy family how she met lionel is unclear but they were married sometime before the 1980s by all accounts lillian was a caring beautiful and sophisticated person as well as comments made by lex and lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality had ambitions of her own and often stood up to lionel eventually lillian began to wonder about the special projects that lionel had she searched for answers and found something called veritas however alexander saw her going through his father s briefcase so lillian asked him not to tell anyone when lionel found out he immediately blamed alexander and forced him to tell the truth when alexander did lillian insisted lionel explain what veritas was but lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again lillian felt angered and disgusted by alexander s betrayal sometime later lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life lionel hired a nurse named rachel dunleavy to assist her rachel and lionel subsequently had an affair resulting in the birth of lionel s illegitimate son lucas it is unclear whether lillian knew of the affair or the child lillian was helped by a nanny pamela jenkins who alexander regarded as a second mother lionel was often absent from home and lillian insisted that he take alexander on one of his business trips to smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 lionel s resulting shame and constant critique of alexander bothered lillian greatly sometime in the early 1990s lionel insisted that they have another child an idea that lillian was highly opposed to presumably because of her poor health however when alexander was 11 lillian became pregnant again she insisted that alexander be allowed to come home for school from excelsior academy and lionel complied her pregnancy was strenuous and lillian was bedridden for much of it on alexander s disastrous 12th birthday which no one attended lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of st george which he kept into adulthood and later gave to clark kent after baby julian s birth lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually one evening lionel sent the baby s nanny home and insisted that lillian bond with the child lillian expressed her concern that lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce a threat that she had apparently made many times and that lionel had called tiresome on returning home from work one night lionel discovered alexander in the baby s nursery alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing julian while trying to stop him from crying lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck alexander their relationship never recovered even after he became an adult it was not until years later after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories that he remembered that lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions hoping to spare him from lionel s maltreatment alexander took the blame correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife sometime before her death lillian along with lex and lionel went to a ranch in montana to spend time together during that time a snake spooked lillian s horse prompting lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better after julian s death lillian s health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when alexander was 13 he later confessed to clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her lex also told lana lang that he was away at boarding school when lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school lillian left her shares of luthorcorp to her son and pamela lillian s death was

showed lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from lionel and luthorcorp however at the end of the vision lana his dream wife suffered complications during childbirth because of lex s lack of resources and estrangement from his father he was unable to transfer lana to a better facility and she died this led lex to believe that lana died because he lacked enough money and power with these everything else in life could be secured as a result lex ignored his mother s warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption after realizing this lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son s choice when lex was injected with the limbo drug which placed its users in a state of clinical death he met lillian again who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice when lex was shot and went into a coma clark kent and lionel used a machine that allowed clark to enter lex s mind in order to find lois lane and kara kent in lex s mind clark met a young version of lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult lex in the memory featuring lillian snooping in lionel s briefcase clark witnessed lionel s verbal and physical abuse of both lex and lillian as well as watched lex try to help his mother up but lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away

severe headaches until he meets prof achilles milo who uses a drug to treat them this treatment also turns lupus into a werewolf milo discovers that lupus suffers from lycanthropy which is the source of anthony s headaches with a serum derived from the alaskan timber wolf milo sends anthony s condition into overdrive transforming him into a full werewolf with the full moon evan as milo claims that he can cure advanced lycanthropy in his first outing anthony lupus werewolf form enters the apartment of a woman and kills her pet dog before the werewolf could kill the woman batman arrived and rescued the woman after the scuffle the werewolf reunited with professor milo and regressed back to anthony lupus when dawn rose and lupus claims that the transformations are getting worse to get the cure anthony will have to kill batman to facilitate the murder plot lupus puts out a charity donation that he wants batman to deliver when batman arrives at lupus house he is tricked into a locked room where knockout gas is pumped into it when milo has batman chained in an abandoned lot he wants anthony to finish the job if he wants the cure when anthony states that he will lose control of this transformation milo does not care upon anthony transforming into the werewolf he attacks milo first where the cure is destroyed during the attack upon breaking free as a storm begins batman fights the werewolf several stories above the ground and manages to impale the werewolf with a metallic rod just then a lightning bolt strikes the metallic rod that impaled the werewolf this causes the werewolf s burning body to fall to the ground when batman made it to the ground where the werewolf landed all he found was a charred metallic rod not long after this there is news in alaska about a man hunting

45 anthony lupus in other media edit in the batman the animated series episode moon of the wolf anthony romulus is closely based on anthony lupus where he is voiced by harry hamlin while the werewolf vocal effects were provided by frank welker romulus was an olympic athlete in gotham city where his athletic abilities were well known anthony romulus entered a decathlon where he immersed himself in intense physical training however romulus devotion to exercise did not give him the confidence in his athletic skills that he would win the games and sought something that would guarantee him a gold medal romulus begged the infamous underworld doctor dr achilles milo to make steroids for him that could not be detected or traced milo gave romulus what he wanted the main ingredient of the drug was a type of wolf estrogen taken from two alaskan timber wolves the steroids allowed him to win the gold medal but he would eventually become a werewolf milo used the promise of a cure to blackmail anthony into doing his dirty work romulus eventually ran afoul of batman when milo sent him to kill zoo security guard john hamner who had allowed milo to steal the alaskan timber wolves from the zoo some time later anthony will have a large charity donation doubled if batman will show up in costume to the romulus mansion this turned out to be a trap set by anthony and dr milo when batman ends up rendered unconscious by mild nerve gas as batman is chained up in the construction site dr milo makes his next plan to dispose of batman when anthony feels the change happening and begged for dr milo to give him the cure dr milo quotes ask me if i care anthony changed into his werewolf form and attacked dr milo who realized too late that he had unleashed a monster he could not control the cure is destroyed during the scuffle and he begins to fight batman who has managed to get free himself the fight took them to the top of the construction site as the police arrive batman threw a crane hook at anthony and lightning strikes both the hook and romulus followed by the werewolf falling into the river after dr milo is loaded into the ambulance detective harvey bullock tells commissioner gordon that he and the other police officers were unable to find the werewolf upon searching miles of shoreline harvey also remarks that by the next full moon they will know if the werewolf survived or not the following scene shows anthony romulus estate being sold to pay off the creditors as the real estate lady remarks that anthony romulus has skipped town for unknown reasons what had happened to anthony romulus remains a mystery to the public issue 21 of the batman adventures a comic book based on the animated series brought back anthony romulus werewolf form and tygrus alongside man bat when they are used by the recently escaped doctor emile dorian to capture catwoman anthony romulus wanted emile to cure him of his lycanthropy after their mission during the fight with batman man bat tygrus dorian and romulus are all apparently killed in an explosion that ensues although anthony lupus didn t appear in all new batman the brave and the bold there were similar werewolves previously

members of the solanaceae the solanaceae sɒləˈneɪʃiː citation needed or nightshades are a family of flowering plants that ranges from annual and perennial herbs to vines lianas epiphytes shrubs and trees and includes a number of agricultural crops medicinal plants spices weeds and ornamentals many members of the family contain potent alkaloids and some are highly toxic but many including tomatoes potatoes eggplant bell and chili peppers are used as food the family belongs to the order solanales in the asterid group and class magnoliopsida dicotyledons 2 the solanaceae consists of about 98 genera and some 2 700 species 3 with a great diversity of habitats morphology and ecology the name solanaceae derives from the genus solanum the etymology of the latin word is unclear the name may come from a perceived resemblance of certain solanaceous flowers to the sun and its rays at least one species of solanum is known as the sunberry alternatively the name could originate from the latin verb solare meaning to soothe presumably referring to the soothing pharmacological properties of some of the psychoactive species of the family this family has a worldwide distribution being present on all continents except antarctica the greatest diversity in species is found in south america and central america in 2017 scientists reported on their discovery and analysis of a fossil species belonging to the living genus physalis physalis infinemundi found in the patagonian region of argentina dated to 52 million years ago the finding has pushed back the earliest appearance of the plant family solanaceae 4 the solanaceae family includes a number of commonly collected or cultivated species the most economically important genus of the family is solanum which contains the potato s tuberosum in fact another common name of the family is the potato family the tomato s lycopersicum and the eggplant or aubergine s melongena another important genus capsicum produces both chili peppers and bell peppers the genus physalis produces the so called groundcherries as well as the tomatillo physalis philadelphica physalis peruviana cape gooseberry and physalis alkekengi chinese lantern the genus lycium contains the boxthorns and the goji berry lycium barbarum nicotiana contains among other species tobacco some other important members of solanaceae include a number of ornamental plants such as petunia browallia and lycianthes and sources of psychoactive alkaloids datura mandragora mandrake and atropa belladonna deadly nightshade certain species are widely known for their medicinal uses their psychotropic effects or for being poisonous 5 most of the economically important genera are contained in the subfamily solanoideae with the exceptions of tobacco nicotiana tabacum nicotianoideae and petunia petunia hybrida petunioideae many of the solanaceae such as tobacco and petunia are used as model organisms in the investigation of fundamental biological questions

surrounding the endosperm a branch with leaves and flowers b stem with immature and mature fruit plants in the solanaceae can take the form of herbs shrubs trees vines and lianas and sometimes epiphytes they can be annuals biennials or perennials upright or decumbent some have subterranean tubers they do not have laticifers nor latex nor coloured saps they can have a basal or terminal group of leaves or neither of these types the leaves are generally alternate or alternate to opposed that is alternate at the base of the plant and opposed towards the inflorescence the leaves can be herbaceous leathery or transformed into spines the leaves are generally petiolate or subsessile rarely sessile they are frequently inodorous but some are aromatic or fetid the foliar lamina can be either simple or compound and the latter can be either pinnatifid or ternate the leaves have reticulated venation and lack a basal meristem the laminae are generally dorsiventral and lack secretory cavities the stomata are generally confined to one of a leaf s two sides they are rarely found on both sides the flowers are generally hermaphrodites although some are monoecious andromonoecious or dioecious species such as some solanum or symonanthus pollination is entomophilous the flowers can be solitary or grouped into terminal cymose or axillary inflorescences the flowers are medium sized fragrant nicotiana fetid anthocercis or inodorous the flowers are usually actinomorphic slightly zygomorphic or markedly zygomorphic for example in flowers with a bilabial corolla in schizanthus species the irregularities in symmetry can be due to the androecium to the perianth or both at the same time in the great majority of species the flowers have a differentiated perianth with a calyx and corolla with five sepals and five petals respectively an androecium with five stamens and two carpels forming a gynoecium with a superior ovary 7 they are therefore referred to as pentamers and tetracyclic the stamens are epipetalous and are typically present in multiples of four or five most commonly four or eight they usually have a hypogynous disk the calyx is gamosepalous as the sepals are joined forming a tube with the 4 5 6 segments equal it has five lobes with the lobes shorter than the tube it is persistent and often accrescent the corolla usually has five petals that are also joined forming a tube flower shapes are typically rotate wheel shaped spreading in one plane with a short tube or tubular elongated cylindrical tube campanulated or funnel shaped the androecium has 2 4 5 6 free stamens within it opposite sepals they alternate with the petals they are usually fertile or in some cases for example in salpiglossideae they have staminodes in the latter case there is usually either one staminode salpiglossis or three schizanthus the anthers touch on their upper end forming a ring or they are completely free dorsifixed or basifixed with poricide dehiscence or through small longitudinal cracks the stamen s filament can be filliform or flat the stamens can be inserted inside the coralline tube or exserted the plants demonstrate simultaneous microsporogenesis the microspores are tetrad tetrahedral or isobilateral the pollen grains are bicellular at the moment of dehiscence usually open and angular the gynoecium is bicarpelar rarely three or five locular with a superior ovary and two locules which may be secondarily divided by false septa as is the case for nicandreae and datureae the gynoecium is located in an oblique position relative to the flower s median plane they have one style and one stigma the latter is simple or bilobate each locule has one to 50 ovules that are anatropous or hemianatropous with axillar placentation the development of the embryo sack can be the same as for polygonum or allium species the embryo sack s nuclear poles become fused before fertilization the three antipodes are usually ephemeral or persistent as in the case of atropa the fruit can be a berry as in the case of the tomato or wolfberry a dehiscent capsule as in datura or a drupe the fruit has axial placentation the capsules are normally septicidal or rarely loculicidal or valvate the seeds are usually endospermic oily rarely starchy and without obvious hairs the seeds of most solanaceae are round and flat about 2 4 mm 0 079 0 157 in in diameter the embryo can be straight or curved and has two cotyledons most species in the solanaceae have 2n 24 chromosomes 8 but the number may be a higher multiple of 12 due to polyploidy wild potatoes of which there are about 200 are predominantly diploid 2 12 24 chromosomes but triploid 3 12 36 chromosomes tetraploid 4 12 48 chromosomes pentaploid 5 12 60 and even hexaploid 6 12 72 chromosome species or populations exist the cultivated species solanum tuberosum has 4 12 48 chromosomes some capsicum species have 2 12 24 chromosomes while others have 26 chromosomes diversity of characteristics edit despite the previous description the solanaceae exhibit a large morphological variability even in their reproductive characteristics examples of this diversity include 9 10 the number of carpels that form the gynoecium in general the solanaceae have a gynoecium the female part of the flower formed of two carpels however melananthus has a monocarpelar gynoecium there are three or four carpels in capsicum three to five in nicandra some species of jaborosa and trianaea and four carpels in iochroma umbellatum the number of locules in the ovary the number of locules in the ovary is usually the same as the number of carpels however some species occur in which the numbers are not the same due to the existence of false septa internal walls that subdivide each locule such as in datura and some members of the lycieae the genera grabowskia and vassobia type of ovules and their number the ovules are generally inverted folded sharply backwards anatropous but some genera have ovules that are rotated at right angles to their stalk campilotropous as in phrodus grabowskia or vassobia or are partially inverted hemitropous as in cestrum capsicum schizanthus and lycium the number of ovules per locule also varies from a few two pairs in each locule in grabowskia one pair in each locule in lycium and very occasionally only one ovule is in each locule as for example in melananthus the type of fruit the fruits of the great majority of the solanaceae are berries or capsules including pyxidia and less often drupes berries are common in the subfamilies cestroideae solanoideae with the exception of datura oryctus grabowskia and the tribe hyoscyameae and the tribe juanulloideae with the exception of markea capsules are characteristic of the subfamilies cestroideae with the exception of cestrum and schizanthoideae the tribes salpiglossoideae and anthocercidoideae and the genus datura the tribe hyoscyameae has pyxidia drupes are typical of the lycieae tribe and in iochrominae 11 alkaloids edit alkaloids are nitrogenous organic substances produced by plants as a secondary metabolite and which have an intense physiological action on animals even at low doses citation needed solanaceae are known for having a diverse range of alkaloids to humans these alkaloids can be desirable toxic or both the tropanes are the most well known of the alkaloids found in the solanaceae the plants that contain these substances have been used for centuries as poisons however despite being recognized as poisons many of these substances have invaluable pharmaceutical properties many species contain a variety of alkaloids that can be more or less active or poisonous such as scopolamine atropine hyoscyamine and nicotine they are found in plants such as henbane hyoscyamus albus belladonna atropa belladonna jimson weed datura stramonium mandrake mandragora autumnalis tobacco and others some of the main types of alkaloids are chemical structure of solanine solanine a toxic glycoalkaloid with a bitter taste it has the formula c45h73no15 it is formed by the alkaloid solanidine with a carbohydrate side chain it is found in leaves fruit and tubers of various solanaceae such as the potato and tomato its production is thought to be an adaptive defence strategy against herbivores substance intoxication from solanine is characterized by gastrointestinal disorders diarrhoea vomiting abdominal pain and neurological disorders hallucinations and headache the median lethal dose is between 2 and 5 mg kg of body weight symptoms become manifest 8 to 12 hours after ingestion the amount of these glycoalkaloids in potatoes for example varies significantly depending on environmental conditions during their cultivation the length of storage and the variety the average glycoalkaloid concentration is 0 075 mg g of potato 12 solanine has occasionally been responsible for poisonings in people who ate berries from species such as solanum nigrum or solanum dulcamara or green potatoes 13 14 chemical structure of the tropanes tropanes the term tropane comes from a genus in which they are found atropa the belladonna genus atropa is named after the greek fate atropos who cut the thread of life this nomenclature reflects its toxicity and lethality they are bicyclic organic nitrogen compounds iupac nomenclature 8 methyl 8 azabicyclo 3 2 1 octane with the chemical formula of c8h15n these alkaloids include among others atropine cocaine scopolamine and hyoscyamine they are found in various species such as mandrake mandragora officinarum and m autumnalis black henbane or stinking nightshade hyoscyamus niger belladonna atropa belladonna jimson weed or devil s snare datura stramonium and brugmansia as well as many others in the family solanaceae 15 pharmacologically they are the most powerful known anticholinergics in existence meaning they inhibit the neurological signals transmitted by the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine more commonly they can halt many types of allergic reactions symptoms of overdose may include dry mouth dilated pupils ataxia urinary retention hallucinations convulsions coma and death atropine a commonly used ophthalmological agent dilates the pupils and thus facilitates examination of the interior of the eye in fact juice from the berries of a belladonna were used by italian courtesans during the renaissance to exaggerate the size of their eyes by causing the dilation of their pupils bella donna means pretty woman in italian despite the extreme toxicity of the tropanes they are useful drugs when administered in extremely small dosages they can reverse cholinergic poisoning which can be caused by overexposure to organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare agents such as sarin and vx scopolamine found in hyoscyamus muticus and scopolia carniolica is used as an antiemetic against motion sickness or for people suffering from nausea as a result of receiving chemotherapy 16 17 scopolamine and hyoscyamine are the most widely used tropane alkaloids in pharmacology and medicine due to their effects on the parasympathetic nervous system atropine has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system and heart whereas scopolamine has a sedative effect these alkaloids cannot be substituted by any other class of compounds so they are still in demand this is one of the reasons for the development of an active field of research into the metabolism of the alkaloids the enzymes involved and the genes that produce them hyoscyamine 6 β hydroxylase for example catalyses the hydroxylation of hyoscyamine that leads to the production of scopolamine at the end of the tropane s biosynthetic pathway this enzyme has been isolated and the corresponding gene cloned from three species h niger a belladonna and b candida 18 19 20 chemical structure of nicotine nicotine nicotine iupac nomenclature s 3 1 methylpyrrolidin 2 yl pyridine is a pyrrolidine alkaloid produced in large quantities in the tobacco plant nicotiana tabacum edible solanaceae such as eggplants tomatoes potatoes and peppers also contain nicotine but at concentrations 100 000 to 1 000 000 times less than tobacco 21 22 nicotine s function in a plant is to act as a defense against herbivores as it is a very effective neurotoxin in particular against insects in fact nicotine has been used for many years as an insecticide though its use is currently being replaced by synthetic molecules derived from its structure at low concentrations nicotine acts as a stimulant in mammals which causes the dependency in smokers like the tropanes it acts on cholinergic neurons but with the opposite effect it is an agonist as opposed to an antagonist it has a higher specificity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors than other ach proteins chemical structure of capsaicin capsaicin capsaicin iupac nomenclature 8 methyl n vanillyl trans 6 nonenamide is structurally different from nicotine and the tropanes it is found in species of the genus capsicum which includes chilis and habaneros and it is the active ingredient that determines the scoville rating of these spices the compound is not noticeably toxic to humans however it stimulates specific pain receptors in the majority of mammals specifically those related to the perception of heat in the oral mucosa and other epithelial tissues when capsaicin comes into contact with these mucosae it causes a burning sensation little different from a burn caused by fire capsaicin affects only mammals not birds pepper seeds can survive the digestive tracts of birds their fruit becomes brightly coloured once its seeds are mature enough to germinate thereby attracting the attention of birds that then distribute the seeds capsaicin extract is used to make pepper spray a useful deterrent against aggressive and peaceful mammals distribution edit map showing the distribution of the solanaceae throughout the world light green areas even though members of the solanaceae are found on all continents except antarctica the greatest variety of species are found in central america and south america centers of diversity also occur in australia and africa solanaceae occupy a great number of different ecosystems from deserts to rainforests and are often found in the secondary vegetation that colonizes disturbed areas in general plants in this family are of tropical and temperate distribution plant host edit the potato tuber moth phthorimaea operculella is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family solanaceae especially the potato plant solanum tuberosum female p operculella use the leaves to lay their eggs and the hatched larvae will eat away at the mesophyll of the leaf after feeding on the foliage the larvae will then delve down and feed on the tubers and roots of the plant 23 taxonomy edit the following taxonomic synopsis of the solanaceae including subfamilies tribes and genera is based on the most recent molecular phylogenetics studies of the family 2 3 24 25 cestroideae browallioideae edit cestrum elegans subfamily cestroideae a shrub used as an ornamental browallia americana streptosolen jamesonii cultivated

basic chromosome number is x 10 schizanthus is a somewhat atypical genus among the solanaceae due to its strongly zygomorphic flowers and basic chromosome number morphological and molecular data suggest schizanthus is a sister genus to the other solanaceae and diverged early from the rest probably in the late cretaceous or in the early cenozoic 50 million years ago 24 25 the great diversity of flower types within schizanthus has been the product of the species adaptation to the different types of pollinators that existed in the mediterranean high alpine and desert ecosystems then present

solanum lycopersicum the pepper capsicum annuum and the aubergine or eggplant solanum melongena nicotiana tabacum originally from south america is now cultivated throughout the world to produce tobacco many solanaceas are important weeds in various parts of the world their importance lies in the fact that they can host pathogens or diseases of the cultivated plants therefore their presence increases the loss of yield or the quality of the harvested product an example of this can be seen with acnistus arborescens and browalia americana that host thrips which cause damage to associated cultivated plants 42 and certain species of datura that play host to various types of virus that are later transmitted to cultivated solanaceas 43 some species of weeds such as solanum mauritianum in south africa represent such serious ecological and economic problems that studies are being carried out with the objective of developing a biological control through the use of insects 44 a wide variety of plant species and their cultivars belonging to the solanaceae are grown as ornamental trees shrubs annuals and herbaceous perennials 45 examples include brugmansia x candida angel s trumpet grown for its large pendulous trumpet shaped flowers or brunfelsia latifolia whose flowers are very fragrant and change colour from violet to white over a period of 3 days other shrub species that are grown for their attractive flowers are lycianthes rantonnetii blue potato bush or paraguay nightshade with violet blue flowers and nicotiana glauca tree tobacco other solanaceous species and genera that are grown as ornamentals are the petunia petunia hybrida lycium solanum cestrum calibrachoa hybrida and solandra there is even a hybrid between petunia and calibrachoa which constitutes a new

hyoscyamus and datura 5 solanaceae and the genome edit many of the species belonging to this family among them tobacco and the tomato are model organisms that are used for research into fundamental biological questions one of the aspects of the solanaceas genomics is an international project that is trying to understand how the same collection of genes and proteins can give rise to a group of organisms that are so morphologically and ecologically different the first objective of this project was to sequence the genome of the tomato in order to achieve this each of the 12 chromosomes of the tomato s haploid genome was assigned to different sequencing centres in different countries so chromosomes 1 and 10 were sequenced in the united states 3 and 11 in china 2 in korea 4 in britain 5 in india 7 in france 8 in japan 9 in spain and 12 in italy the sequencing of the mitochondrial genome was carried out in argentina and the chloroplast genome was sequenced in the european union 48 49 see

hauh huah and hehu citation needed was the personification of infinity or eternity in the ogdoad in ancient egyptian religion 1 his name originally meant flood referring to the watery chaos that the egyptians believed existed before the creation of the world 2 the egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite in contrast with the finite created world so heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters 3 heh s female counterpart was known as hauhet which is simply the feminine form of his name 1 like the other concepts in the ogdoad his male form was often depicted as a frog or a frog headed human and his female form as a snake or snake headed human the frog head symbolised fertility creation and regeneration and was also possessed by the other ogdoad males kek amun and nun 4 the other common representation depicts him crouching holding a palm stem in each hand or just one 5 sometimes with a palm stem in his hair as palm stems represented long life to the egyptians the years being represented by notches on it depictions of this form also had a shen ring at the base of each palm stem which represented infinity depictions of heh were also used in hieroglyphs to represent one million which was essentially considered equivalent to infinity in ancient egyptian mathematics thus this deity is also known as the god of millions of years contents 1 origins and mythology 2 forms

goddess ancient egypt portalvte the primary meaning of the egyptian word ḥeḥ was million or millions a personification of this concept ḥeḥ was adopted as the egyptian god of infinity with his female counterpart ḥauḥet or ḥeḥut ḥeḥ represented one of the four god goddess pairs comprising the ogdoad a pantheon of eight primeval deities whose worship was centred at hermopolis magna the mythology of the ogdoad describes its eight members heh and hauhet nu and naunet amun and amaunet and kuk and kauket coming together in the cataclysmic event that gives rise to the sun and its deific personification atum 6 forms and iconography edit the god ḥeḥ was usually depicted anthropomorphically as in the hieroglyphic character as a male figure with divine beard and lappet wig normally kneeling one knee raised sometimes in a basket the sign for all the god typically holds in each hand a notched palm branch palm rib these were employed in the temples for ceremonial time keeping which use explains the use of the palm branch as the hieroglyphic symbol for rnp t year 7 occasionally an additional palm branch is worn on the god s head in ancient egyptian numerology gods such as heh were used to represent numbers in a decimal point system particularly the number 1 000 000 is depicted in the hieroglyph of heh who is in his normal seated position 8 cult and worship edit the personified somewhat abstract god of eternity ḥeḥ possessed no known cult centre or sanctuary rather his veneration revolved around symbolism and personal belief the god s image and its iconographic elements reflected the wish for millions of years of life or rule as such the figure of ḥeḥ finds frequent representation in amulets prestige items and royal iconography from the late old kingdom period onwards heh became associated with the king and his quest for longevity for instance he appears on the tomb of king tutankhamen in two cartouches where he is crowned with a winged scarab beetle symbolizing existence and a sun disk the placement of heh in relation to king tutankhamen s corpse means he will be granting him these millions of years into the afterlife 9 gallery edit tutankhamun s

language epic music dramas composed by richard wagner the works are based loosely on characters from germanic heroic legend namely norse legendary sagas and the nibelungenlied the composer termed the cycle a bühnenfestspiel stage festival play structured in three days preceded by a vorabend preliminary evening it is often referred to as the ring cycle wagner s ring or simply the ring wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty six years from 1848 to 1874 the four parts that constitute the ring cycle are in sequence das rheingold the rhinegold die walküre the valkyrie siegfried götterdämmerung twilight of the gods individual works of the sequence are often performed separately 1 and indeed the operas contain dialogues that mention events in the previous operas so that a viewer could watch any of them without having watched the previous parts and still understand the plot however wagner intended them to be performed in series the first performance as a cycle opened the first bayreuth festival in 1876 beginning with das rheingold on 13 august and ending with götterdämmerung on 17 august opera stage director anthony freud stated that der ring des nibelungen

dwarf alberich and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the rhine gold the title therefore denotes alberich s ring 3 content edit the cycle is a work of extraordinary scale 4 a full performance of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera with a total playing time of about 15 hours depending on the conductor s pacing the first and shortest work das rheingold has no interval and is one continuous piece of music typically lasting around two and a half hours while the final and longest götterdämmerung takes up to five hours excluding intervals the cycle is modelled after ancient greek dramas that were presented as three tragedies and one satyr play the ring proper begins with die walküre and ends with götterdämmerung with rheingold as a prelude wagner called das rheingold a vorabend or preliminary evening and die walküre siegfried and götterdämmerung were subtitled first day second day and third day respectively of the trilogy proper the scale and scope of the story is epic it follows the struggles of gods heroes and several mythical creatures over the eponymous magic ring that grants domination over the entire world the drama and intrigue continue through three generations of protagonists until the final cataclysm at the end of götterdämmerung the music of the cycle is thick and richly textured and grows in complexity as the cycle proceeds wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions including a greatly enlarged brass section with new instruments such as the wagner tuba bass trumpet and contrabass trombone remarkably he uses a chorus only relatively briefly in acts 2 and 3 of götterdämmerung and then mostly of men with just a few women he eventually had a purpose built theatre constructed the bayreuth festspielhaus in which to perform this work the theatre has a special stage that blends the huge orchestra with the singers voices allowing them to sing at a natural volume the result was that the singers did not have to strain themselves vocally during the long performances list of characters edit gods mortals valkyries rhinemaidens giants nibelungs other characters wotan king of the gods god of light air and wind

illustration of brünnhilde by odilon redon 1885 the plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world forged by the nibelung dwarf alberich from gold he stole from the rhine maidens in the river rhine with the assistance of the god loge wotan the chief of the gods steals the ring from alberich but is forced to hand it over to the giants fafner and fasolt in payment for building the home of the gods valhalla or they will take freia who provides the gods with the golden apples that keep them young wotan s schemes to regain the ring spanning generations drive much of the action in the story his grandson the mortal siegfried wins the ring by slaying fafner who slew fasolt for the ring as wotan intended but is eventually betrayed and slain as a result of the intrigues of alberich s son hagen who wants the ring for himself finally the valkyrie brünnhilde siegfried s lover and wotan s daughter who lost her immortality for defying her father in an attempt to save siegfried s father sigmund returns the ring to the rhine maidens as she commits suicide on siegfried s funeral pyre hagen is drowned as he attempts to recover the ring in the process the gods and valhalla are destroyed details of the storylines can be found in the articles on each music drama wagner created the story of the ring by fusing elements from many german and scandinavian myths and folk tales the old norse edda supplied much of the material for das rheingold while die walküre was largely based on the völsunga saga siegfried contains elements from the eddur the völsunga saga and thidrekssaga the final götterdämmerung draws from the 12th century german poem the nibelungenlied which appears to have been the original inspiration for the ring 5 the ring has been the subject of myriad interpretations for example george bernard shaw in the perfect wagnerite argues for a view of the ring as an essentially socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses robert donington in wagner s ring and its symbols interprets it in terms of jungian psychology as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind leading towards individuation concept edit in his earlier operas up to and including lohengrin wagner s style had been based rather than on the italian style of opera on the german style as developed by carl maria von weber with elements of the grand opera style of giacomo meyerbeer however he came to be dissatisfied with such a format as a means of artistic expression he expressed this clearly in his essay a communication to my friends 1851 in which he condemned the majority of modern artists in painting and in music as feminine the world of art close fenced from life in which art plays with herself where however the impressions of life produce an overwhelming poetic force we find the masculine the generative path of art 6 wagner unfortunately found that his audiences were not willing to follow where he led them the public by their enthusiastic reception of rienzi and their cooler welcome of the flying dutchman had plainly shown me what i must set before them if i sought to please i completely undeceived their expectations they left the theatre after the first performance of tannhäuser 1845 in a confused and discontented mood the feeling of utter loneliness in which i now found myself quite unmanned me my tannhäuser had appealed to a handful of intimate friends alone 7 finally wagner announces i shall never write an opera more as i have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works i will call them dramas i propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas preceded by a lengthy prelude vorspiel at a specially appointed festival i propose some future time to produce those three dramas with their prelude in the course of three days and a fore evening the object of this production i shall consider thoroughly attained if i and my artistic comrades the actual performers shall within these four evenings succeed in artistically conveying my purpose to the true emotional not the critical understanding of spectators who shall have gathered together expressly to learn it 8 this is his first public announcement of the form of what would become the ring cycle in accordance with the ideas expressed in his essays of the period 1849 51 including the communication but also opera and drama and the artwork of the future the four parts of the ring were originally conceived by wagner to be free of the traditional operatic concepts of aria and operatic chorus the wagner scholar curt von westernhagen identified three important problems discussed in opera and drama which were particularly relevant to the ring cycle the problem of unifying verse stress with melody the disjunctions caused by formal arias in dramatic structure and the way in which opera music could be organised on a different basis of organic growth and modulation and the function of musical motifs in linking elements of the plot whose connections might otherwise be inexplicit this became known as the leitmotif technique see below although wagner himself did not use this word 9 however wagner relaxed some aspects of his self imposed restrictions somewhat as the work progressed as george bernard shaw sardonically and slightly unfairly 10 noted of the last opera götterdämmerung and now o nibelungen spectator pluck up for all allegories come to an end somewhere the rest of what you are going to see is opera and nothing but opera before many bars have been played siegfried and the wakened brynhild newly become tenor and soprano will sing a concerted cadenza plunge on from that to a magnificent love duet the work which follows entitled night falls on the gods shaw s translation of götterdämmerung is a thorough grand opera 11 music edit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed april 2017 learn how and when to remove this template message leitmotifs edit as a significant element in the ring and his subsequent works wagner adopted the use of leitmotifs which are recurring themes or harmonic progressions they musically denote an action object emotion character or other subject mentioned in the text or presented onstage wagner referred to them in opera and drama as guides to feeling describing how they could be used to inform the listener of a musical or dramatic subtext to the action onstage in the same way as a greek chorus did for the theatre of ancient greece instrumentation edit wagner made significant innovations in orchestration in this work he wrote for a very large orchestra using the whole range of instruments used singly or in combination to express the great range of emotion and events of the drama wagner even commissioned the production of new instruments including the wagner tuba invented to fill a gap he found between the tone qualities of the horn and the trombone as well as variations of existing instruments such as the bass trumpet and a contrabass trombone with a double slide he also developed the wagner bell enabling the bassoon to reach the low a natural whereas normally b flat is the instrument s lowest note if such a bell is not to be used then a contrabassoon should be employed all four parts have a very similar instrumentation the core ensemble of instruments are one piccolo three flutes third doubling second piccolo three oboes cor anglais doubling fourth oboe three soprano clarinets one bass clarinet three bassoons eight horns fifth through eight doubling wagner tubas three trumpets one bass trumpet three tenor trombones one contrabass trombone doubling bass trombone one contrabass tuba a percussion section with 4 timpani requiring two players triangle cymbals glockenspiel tam tam six harps and a string section consisting of 16 first and 16 second violins 12 violas 12 cellos and 8 double basses das rheingold requires one bass drum one onstage harp and 18 onstage anvils die walküre requires one snare drum one d clarinet played by the third clarinettist and an on stage steerhorn siegfried requires one onstage cor anglais and one onstage horn götterdämmerung requires a tenor drum as well as five onstage horns and four onstage steerhorns one of them to be blown by hagen tonality edit much of the ring especially from siegfried act 3 onwards cannot be said to be in traditional clearly defined keys for long stretches but rather in key regions each of which flows smoothly into the following this fluidity avoided the musical equivalent of clearly defined musical paragraphs and assisted wagner in building the work s huge structures tonal indeterminacy was heightened by the increased freedom with which he used dissonance and chromaticism chromatically altered chords are used very liberally in the ring and this feature which is also prominent in tristan und isolde is often cited as a milestone on the way to arnold schoenberg s revolutionary break with the traditional concept of key and his dissolution of consonance as the basis of an organising principle in music composition edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

wrote the nibelung myth as sketch for a drama combining the medieval sources previously mentioned into a single narrative very similar to the plot of the eventual ring cycle but nevertheless with substantial differences later that year he began writing a libretto entitled siegfrieds tod siegfried s death he was possibly stimulated by a series of articles in the neue zeitschrift für musik inviting composers to write a national opera based on the nibelungenlied a 12th century high german poem which since its rediscovery in 1755 had been hailed by the german romantics as the german national epic siegfrieds tod dealt with the death of siegfried the central heroic figure of the nibelungenlied the idea had occurred to others the correspondence of fanny and felix mendelssohn in 1840 41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios on the subject fanny wrote the hunt with siegfried s death provides a splendid finale to the second act 12 by 1850 wagner had completed a musical sketch which he abandoned for siegfrieds tod citation needed he now felt that he needed a preliminary opera der junge siegfried the young siegfried later renamed to siegfried to explain the events in siegfrieds tod and his verse draft of this was completed in may 1851 citation needed by october he had made the momentous decision to embark on a cycle of four operas to be played over four nights das rheingold die walküre der junge siegfried and siegfrieds tod the text for all four parts was completed in december 1852 and privately published in february 1853 citation needed the music edit main article der ring des nibelungen composition of the music in november 1853 wagner began the composition draft of das rheingold unlike the verses which were written as it were in reverse order the music would be composed in the same order as the narrative composition proceeded until 1857 when the final score up to the end of act 2 of siegfried was completed wagner then laid the work aside for twelve years during which he wrote tristan und isolde and die meistersinger von nürnberg by 1869 wagner was living at tribschen on lake lucerne sponsored by king ludwig ii of bavaria he returned to siegfried and remarkably was able to pick up where he left off in october he completed the final work in the cycle he chose the title götterdämmerung instead of siegfrieds tod in the completed work the gods are destroyed in accordance with the new pessimistic thrust of the cycle not redeemed as in the more optimistic originally planned ending wagner also decided to show onstage the events of das rheingold and die walküre which had hitherto only been presented as back narration in the other two parts these changes resulted in some discrepancies in the cycle but these do not diminish the value of the

objections special previews of das rheingold and die walküre were given at the national theatre in munich before the rest of the ring thus das rheingold premiered on 22 september 1869 and die walküre on 26 june 1870 wagner subsequently delayed announcing his completion of siegfried to prevent this work also being premiered against his wishes wagner had long desired to have a special festival opera house designed by himself for the performance of the ring in 1871 he decided on a location in the bavarian town of bayreuth in 1872 he moved to bayreuth and the foundation stone was laid wagner would spend the next two years attempting to raise capital for the construction with scant success king ludwig finally rescued the project in 1874 by donating the needed funds the bayreuth festspielhaus opened in 1876 with the first complete performance of the ring which took place from 13 to 17 august in 1882 london impresario alfred schulz curtius organized the first staging in the united kingdom of the ring cycle conducted by anton seidl and directed by angelo neumann 13 the first production of the ring in italy was in venice the place where wagner died just two months after his 1883 death at la fenice 14 the first australasian ring and the mastersingers of nuremberg was presented by the thomas quinlan company melbourne and sydney in 1913 modern productions edit the ring is a major undertaking for any opera company staging four interlinked operas requires a huge commitment both artistically and financially hence in most opera houses production of a new ring cycle will happen over a number of years with one or two operas in the cycle being added each year the bayreuth festival where the complete cycle is performed most years is unusual in that a new cycle is almost always created within a single year early productions of the ring cycle stayed close to wagner s original bayreuth staging trends set at bayreuth have continued to be influential following the closure of the festspielhaus during the second world war the 1950s saw productions by wagner s grandsons wieland and wolfgang wagner known as the new bayreuth style which emphasised the human aspects of the drama in a more abstract setting 15 gwyneth jones performing at the 1976 bayreuth production of der ring des nibelungen conducted by pierre boulez and directed by patrice chéreau perhaps the most famous modern production was the centennial production of 1976 the jahrhundertring directed by patrice chéreau and conducted by pierre boulez 16 set in the industrial revolution it replaced the depths of the rhine with a hydroelectric power dam and featured grimy sets populated by men and gods in 19th and 20th century business suits this drew heavily on the reading of the ring as a revolutionary drama and critique of the modern world famously expounded by george bernard shaw in the perfect wagnerite early performances were booed but the audience of 1980 gave it a 45 minute ovation in its final year 17 18 seattle opera has created three different productions of the tetralogy ring 1 1975 to 1984 originally directed by george london with designs by john naccarato following the famous illustrations by arthur rackham it was performed twice each summer once in german once in andrew porter s english adaptation henry holt conducted all performances ring 2 1985 1995 directed by francois rochaix with sets and costumes designed by robert israel lighting by joan sullivan and supertitles the first ever created for the ring by sonya friedman the production set the action in a world of nineteenth century theatricality it was initially controversial in 1985 it sold out its final performances in 1995 conductors included armin jordan die walküre in 1985 manuel rosenthal 1986 and hermann michael 1987 1991 and 1995 ring 3 2000 2013 the production which became known as the green ring was in part inspired by the natural beauty of the pacific northwest directed by stephen wadsworth set designer

mariinsky opera saint petersburg designed by george tsypin the production drew parallels with ossetian mythology 20 the royal danish opera performed a complete ring cycle in may 2006 in its new waterfront home the copenhagen opera house this version of the ring tells the story from the viewpoint of brünnhilde and has a distinct feminist angle for example in a key scene in die walküre it is sieglinde and not siegmund who manages to pull the sword nothung out of a tree at the end of the cycle brünnhilde does not die but instead gives birth to siegfried s child 21 san francisco opera and washington national opera began a co production of a new cycle in 2006 directed by francesca zambello the production uses imagery from various eras of american history and has a feminist and environmentalist viewpoint recent performances of this production took place at the john f kennedy center for the performing arts in washington d c in april may 2016 featuring catherine foster and

staging was dominated by a 90 000 pound 40 tonne structure which consisted of 24 identical aluminium planks able to rotate independently on a horizontal axis across the stage providing level sloping angled or moving surfaces facing the audience bubbles falling stones and fire were projected on to these surfaces linked by computer with the music and movement of the characters the subsequent hd

lepage s machine as it affectionately became known underwent major reconfiguration for the revival in order to dampen the creaking that it had produced in the past to the annoyance of audience members and critics and to improve its reliability as it had been known to break down during earlier runs including on the opening night of rheingold 26 27 28 opera australia presented the ring cycle at the

by speaking the desired effect backwards cannot affect human beings zachary zatara is a fictional character in the dc universe zachary is a descendant of the homo magi just like his cousin zatanna and uncle john zatara he first appeared in teen titans vol 3 34 and was created by geoff johns and tony daniel contents 1 character biography 2 powers and abilities 3 appearance 4 other versions 4 1 kingdom come 4 2 tiny titans 5 references character biography edit after the events of day of vengeance when magic in the dc universe was changed zachary developed abilities similar to his relatives zatanna zatara and john zatara calling himself the most popular teenaged magician he briefly joins the teen titans zachary has little tact patience and modesty when it comes to his skills as a result he was left with few to no friends amongst the titans many of whom looked at him as a selfish brat during the initial auditions for the teen titans zachary met with kid devil eddie bloomberg with whom he would share a very shaky friendship one night after performing as a stage magician in metropolis zachary is approached by eddie who asks him about a mysterious candle he found zachary explains that eddie s candle is magical in nature and eddie lights it they are transported to neron s realm and meet neron himself although zachary advises him not to listen to neron s offers eddie makes a deal with the demon where he is transformed into a real demon neron then sends both the new kid devil and zachary back to earth zachary reluctantly keeps eddie s secret zachary helped eddie gain entrance into the teen titans and together they have multiple adventures they battle kid crusader and during one stint went to new azarath where they are almost eaten by the phantasm zachary remains a titan for several months before eventually quitting because one of his female teammates was driving him crazy destabilizing his powers zachary briefly appears in the limited series world war iii along with several other titans he tries to stop the murderous rampage of black adam in greece he is slammed into a wall and injured the titans are forced to leave him behind but he receives medical aid from greek authorities 1 one year later he is performing as a professional stage magician in japan with an attractive young japanese assistant called bunny who he treats with mixed amounts of kindness and condescension the current teen titans come to speak with him as they are looking for raven zachary wants nothing to do with them and does not remember his times with eddie or the titans fondly still he states that raven had come to him in japan and began to ask him weird questions about herself 2 after he kicks them out it is revealed he possesses a secret photo of raven at the last second he tries to call eddie back but they have already left and he goes back to his show although zachary has a less than close relationship with the titans he does agree to aid robin and ravager defeat a gang of metahumans assembled by robin s wanna be nemesis dodge he also worked with other magical heroes assisting the justice league in holding back the citizens of new krypton and re empowered a mystically weakened superman to deal with his magical foe atlas during the incident involving the terror titans zatara became one of the imprisoned heroes forced to fight on the behest of the clock king who took over the dark side club 3 following his escape from the dark side club zachary along with the rest of the former captives is offered refuge at the titans tower zachary however rejects this under the misunderstanding that he was being forced to join the team in order to get refuge he returns to metropolis with bunny shortly after 4 zachary also appears in the titans tomorrow arc he is in the reign in hell storyline where he dares to attempt to banish the powerful entity rama kushna and is dealt heavy damage in retaliation he is later forced to aid in the successful restoration of the goddess something that left him drained and weak for a while 5 zachary has appeared in metropolis in issues of superman he was recruited by mark merlin to search for prince ra man 6 he assists in subduing angry raging kryptonians the now expanded citizens from the city of kandor 7 zachary co stars in a back up feature in teen titans alongside black alice and traci 13 which began in may 2010 8 powers and abilities edit like other members of the zatara family zachary is able to manipulate magic by speaking spells backwards so far his powers have been shown to affect inanimate objects summon simple objects into existence and transmogrify one object to another it is unknown how his magical strength level compares with his cousin zatanna his main limitation if compared to his older cousin is his inability to affect living beings directly however he has shown the ability to make doves appear out of his hat and grant superman a few minutes of sunlight energy by indirectly manipulating the inanimate elements surrounding the living entities like zatanna he s a clever illusionist and showman even without resorting to his magic albeit more inclined to brag and abuse his position while zatanna is a widely accepted member of the justice league and an entertainer loved by her public zatara is considered somewhat of a selfish brat as insufferable in a team as he is successful onstage appearance edit in his appearance in 52 keith giffen drew zatara in fishnets like his cousin zatanna as a joke stating as a goof in the breakdowns i drew that new zatara kid in zatanna s fishnets and corset getup the penciler actually drew him that way my pleas to let it go through like that went unheeded 9 10 11 other versions edit kingdom come edit kingdom come features a character named zatara who is similar to zachary zatara in appearance age and reverse talking magic powers he is the son of the late zatanna and john constantine and the grandson of giovanni zatara besides being a magician he inherited his father constantine s ability to see the dead tiny titans edit zatara made a couple appearances inside the children s comic book tiny titans references edit

chemist julius wilbrand 6 and originally used as a yellow dye its potential as an explosive was not recognized for three decades mainly because it was too difficult to detonate because it was less sensitive than alternatives its explosive properties were first discovered in 1891 by another german chemist carl häussermann 7 tnt can be safely poured when liquid into shell cases and is so insensitive that it was exempted from the uk s explosives act 1875 and was not considered an explosive for the purposes of manufacture and storage 8 the german armed forces adopted it as a filling for artillery shells in 1902 tnt filled armour piercing shells would explode after they had penetrated the armour of british capital ships whereas the british lyddite filled shells tended to explode upon striking armour thus expending much of their energy outside the ship 8 the british started replacing lyddite with tnt in 1907 9 the united states navy continued filling armour piercing shells with explosive d after some other nations had switched to tnt but began filling naval mines bombs depth charges and torpedo warheads with burster charges of crude grade b tnt with the color of brown sugar and requiring an explosive booster charge of granular crystallized grade a tnt for detonation high explosive shells were filled with grade a tnt which became preferred for other uses as industrial chemical capacity became available for removing xylene and similar hydrocarbons from the toluene feedstock and other nitrotoluene isomer byproducts from the nitrating reactions 10 chunks of explosives

of the 500 ton tnt explosive charge as part of operation sailor hat in 1965 the passing blast wave left a white water surface behind and a white condensation cloud is visible overhead preparation edit in industry tnt is produced in a three step process first toluene is nitrated with a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene mnt the mnt is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene dnt in the final step the dnt is nitrated to trinitrotoluene tnt using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused after nitration tnt is stabilized by a process called sulfitation where the crude tnt is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of tnt and other undesired reaction products the rinse water from sulfitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of tnt manufacture 11 control of nitrogen oxides in feed nitric acid is very important because free nitrogen dioxide can result in oxidation of the methyl group of toluene this reaction is highly exothermic and carries with it the risk of a runaway reaction leading to an explosion citation needed in the laboratory 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene is produced by a two step process a nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono and di nitrotoluene isomers with careful cooling to maintain temperature the nitrated toluenes are then separated washed with dilute sodium bicarbonate to remove oxides of nitrogen and then carefully nitrated with a mixture of fuming nitric acid and sulfuric acid citation needed applications edit tnt is one of the most commonly used explosives for military industrial and mining applications tnt has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing popularly known as fracking a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations the technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized tnt 12 tnt is valued partly because of its insensitivity to shock and friction with reduced risk of accidental detonation compared to more sensitive explosives such as nitroglycerin tnt melts at 80 c 176 f far below the temperature at which it will spontaneously detonate allowing it to be poured or safely combined with other explosives tnt neither absorbs nor dissolves in water which allows it to be used effectively in wet environments to detonate tnt must be triggered by a pressure wave from a starter explosive called an explosive booster 13 although blocks of tnt are available in various sizes e g 250 g 500 g 1 000 g it is more commonly encountered in synergistic explosive blends comprising a variable percentage of tnt plus other ingredients examples of explosive blends containing tnt include amatex ammonium nitrate and rdx 14 amatol ammonium nitrate 15 ammonal ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder plus sometimes charcoal baratol barium nitrate and wax 16 composition b rdx and paraffin wax 17 composition h6 cyclotol rdx 18 ednatol hexanite 19 hexanitrodiphenylamine 20 21 minol octol pentolite picratol tetrytol torpex tritonal explosive character edit upon detonation tnt undergoes a decomposition equivalent to the reaction 2 c7h5n3o6 3 n2 5 h2 12 co 2 c plus some of the reactions h2 co h2o c and 2 co co2 c the reaction is exothermic but has a high activation energy in the gas phase 62 kcal mol the condensed phases solid or liquid show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities 22 because of the production of carbon tnt explosions have a sooty appearance because tnt has an excess of carbon explosive mixtures with oxygen rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than tnt alone during the 20th century amatol a mixture of tnt with ammonium nitrate was a widely used military explosive citation needed tnt can be detonated with a high velocity initiator or by efficient concussion 23 for many years tnt used to be the reference point for the figure of insensitivity tnt had a rating of exactly 100 on the f of i scale the reference has since been changed to a more sensitive explosive called rdx which has an f of i rating of 80 citation needed energy content edit see also tnt equivalent cross sectional view of oerlikon 20 mm cannon shells dating from c 1945 showing color codes for tnt and pentolite fillings the heat of detonation utilized by nist to define a tonne of tnt equivalent is 1000 cal g or 1000 kcal kg 4 184 mj kg or 4 184 gj ton 24 the energy density of tnt is used as a reference point for many other explosives including nuclear weapons the energy content of which is measured in equivalent kilotons 4 184 terajoules or 4 184 tj or 1 162 gwh or megatons 4 184 petajoules or 4 184 pj or 1 162 twh of tnt the heat of combustion however is 14 5 megajoules per kilogram or 14 5 mj kg or 4 027 kwh kg which requires that some of the carbon in tnt react with atmospheric oxygen which does not occur in the initial event 25 for comparison gunpowder contains 3 megajoules per kilogram dynamite contains 7 5 megajoules per kilogram and gasoline contains 47 2 megajoules per kilogram though gasoline requires an oxidant so an optimized gasoline and o2 mixture contains 10 4 megajoules per kilogram citation needed detection edit various methods can be used to detect tnt including optical and electrochemical sensors and explosive sniffing dogs in 2013 researchers from the indian institutes of technology using noble metal quantum clusters could detect tnt at the sub zeptomolar 10 18 mol m3 level 26 safety and toxicity edit tnt is poisonous and skin contact can cause skin irritation causing the skin to turn a bright yellow orange color during the first world war female munition workers who handled the chemical found that their skin turned bright yellow which resulted in their acquiring the nickname canary girls or simply canaries 27 people exposed to tnt over a prolonged period tend to experience anemia and abnormal liver functions blood and liver effects spleen enlargement and other harmful effects on the immune system have also been found in animals that ingested or breathed trinitrotoluene there is evidence that tnt adversely affects male fertility 28 tnt is listed as a possible human carcinogen with carcinogenic effects demonstrated in animal experiments with rats although effects upon humans so far amount to none according to iris of march 15 2000 29 consumption of tnt produces red urine through the presence of breakdown products and not blood as sometimes believed 30 some military testing grounds are contaminated with wastewater from munitions programs including contamination of surface and subsurface waters which may be colored pink because of the presence of tnt such contamination called pink water may be difficult and expensive to remedy citation needed tnt is prone to exudation of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of trinitrotoluene when projectiles containing tnt are stored at higher temperatures in warmer climates exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze screw thread can form fire channels increasing the risk of accidental detonation fuze malfunction can also result from the liquid migrating into the fuze mechanism 31 calcium silicate is mixed with tnt to mitigate the tendency towards exudation 32 pink and red water edit for the author see daniel pinkwater pink water and red water are two distinct types of wastewater related to trinitrotoluene 33 34 pink water is produced from equipment washing processes after munitions filling or demilitarization operations and as such is generally saturated with the maximum amount of tnt that will dissolve in water about 150 parts per million ppm however it has an indefinite composition that depends on the exact process in particular it may also contain cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine rdx if the plant uses tnt rdx mixtures or hmx if tnt hmx is used red water also known as sellite water is produced during the process used to purify the crude tnt it has a complex composition containing more than a dozen aromatic compounds but the principal components are inorganic salts sodium sulfate sodium sulfite sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate and sulfonated nitroaromatics citation needed pink water is actually colorless at the time of generation whereas red water can be colorless or a very pale red the color is produced by photolytic reactions under the influence of sunlight despite the names red and pink water are not necessarily different shades the color depends mainly on the duration of solar exposure if exposed long enough pink water will become dark brown citation needed because of the toxicity of tnt the discharge of pink water to the environment has been prohibited in the us and many other countries for decades but ground contamination may exist in very old plants however rdx and tetryl contamination is usually considered more problematic as tnt has very low soil mobility red water is significantly more toxic and as such it has always been considered hazardous waste it has traditionally been disposed of by evaporation to dryness as the toxic components are not volatile followed by incineration much research has been conducted to develop better disposal processes citation needed ecological impact edit because of its suitability in construction and demolition tnt has become the most widely used explosive and thus its toxicity is the most characterized and reported residual tnt from manufacture storage and use can pollute water soil the atmosphere and the biosphere 35 the concentration of tnt in contaminated soil can reach 50 g kg of soil where the highest concentrations can be found on or near the surface in september 2001 the united states environmental protection agency usepa declared tnt a pollutant whose removal is a priority 36 the usepa maintains that tnt levels in soil should not exceed 17 2 grams per kilogram of soil and 0 01 milligrams per litre of water 37 aqueous solubility edit dissolution is a measure of the rate that solid tnt in contact with water is dissolved the relatively low aqueous solubility of tnt causes solid particles to be continuously released to the environment over extended periods of time 38 studies have shown that tnt dissolves slower in saline water than in freshwater however when salinity is altered tnt dissolves at the same speed 39 because tnt is moderately soluble in water it can migrate through subsurface soil and cause groundwater contamination 40 soil adsorption edit adsorption is a measure of the distribution between soluble and sediment adsorbed contaminants following attainment of equilibrium tnt and its transformation products are known to adsorb to surface soils and sediments where they undergo reactive transformation or remained stored 41 the movement or organic contaminants through soils is a function of their ability to associate with the mobile phase water and a stationary phase soil materials that associate strongly with soils move slowly through soil the association constant for tnt with soil is 2 7 to 11 l kg of soil 42 this means that tnt has a one to tenfold tendency to adhere to soil particulates than not when introduced into the soil 38 hydrogen bonding and ion exchange are two suggested mechanisms of adsorption between the nitro functional groups and soil colloids the number of functional groups on tnt influences the ability to adsorb into soil adsorption coefficient values have been shown to increase with an increase in the number of amino groups thus adsorption of the tnt decomposition product 2 4 diamino 6 nitrotoluene 2 4 dant was greater than that for 4 amino 2 6 dinitrotoluene 4 adnt which was greater than that for tnt 38 lower adsorption coefficients for 2 6 dnt compared to 2 4 dnt can be attributed to the steric hindrance of the no2 group in the ortho position research has shown that in freshwater environments with high abundances of ca2 the adsorption of tnt and its transformation products to soils and sediments may be lower than observed in a saline environment dominated by k and na therefore when considering the adsorption of tnt the type of soil or sediment and the ionic composition and strength of the ground water are important factors 43 the association constants for tnt and its degradation products with clays have been determined clay minerals have a significant effect on the adsorption of energetic compounds soil properties such as organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity have significant impacts on the adsorption coefficients additional studies have shown that the mobility of tnt degradation products is likely to be lower than tnt in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process 43 thus the mobility of tnt and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent 43 the mobility of tnt in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from sorption and desorption isotherm models determined with humic acids in aquifer sediments and soils 43 from these models it is predicted that tnt has a low retention and transports readily in the environment 36 compared to other explosives tnt has a higher association constant with soil meaning it adheres more with soil than with water conversely other explosives such as rdx and hmx with low association constants ranging from 0 06 to 7 3 l kg and 0 to 1 6 l kg respectively can move more rapidly in water 38 chemical breakdown edit tnt is a reactive molecule and is particularly prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation in the presence of sunlight tnt is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems this includes wholly abiotic reactants like hydrogen sulfide fe2 or microbial communities both oxic and anoxic and photochemical degradation citation needed soils with high clay contents or small particle sizes and high total organic carbon content have been shown to promote tnt transformation possible tnt transformations include reduction of one two or three nitro moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form dimers formation of the two monoamino transformation products 2 adnt and 4 adnt is energetically favored and therefore is observed in contaminated soils and ground water the diamino products are energetically less favorable and even less likely are the triamino products citation needed the transformation of tnt is significantly enhanced under anaerobic conditions as well as under highly reducing conditions tnt transformations in soils can occur both biologically and abiotically 43 photolysis is a major process that impacts the transformation of energetic compounds the alteration of a molecule in photolysis occurs by direct absorption of light energy or by the transfer of energy from a photosensitized compound phototransformation of tnt results in the formation of nitrobenzenes benzaldehydes azodicarboxylic acids and nitrophenols as a result of the oxidation of methyl groups reduction of nitro groups and dimer formation 38 evidence of the photolysis of tnt has been seen due to the color change to pink of tnt containing wastewaters when exposed to sunlight photolysis is more rapid in river water than in distilled water ultimately photolysis affects the fate of tnt primarily in the aquatic environment but could also affect the fate of tnt in soil when the soil surface is exposed to sunlight 43 biodegradation edit the ligninolytic physiological phase and manganese peroxidase system of fungi can cause a very limited amount of mineralization of tnt in a liquid culture though not in soil an organism capable of the remediation of large amounts of tnt in soil has yet to be discovered 44 both wild and transgenic plants can phytoremediate explosives from soil and water 45 see also edit dynamite environmental fate of tnt imx 101 list of explosives used

from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search event occurring in the mind while sleeping for other uses see dream disambiguation a dream of a girl before a sunrise c 1830 33 by karl bryullov 1799 1852 a dream is a succession of images ideas emotions and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep 1 humans spend about two hours dreaming per night 2 and each dream lasts around 5 to 20 minutes although the dreamer may perceive the dream as being much longer than this 3 the content and function of dreams have been topics of scientific philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history dream interpretation practiced by the babylonians in the third millennium bce 4 and even earlier by the ancient sumerians 5 6 figures prominently in religious texts in several traditions and has played a lead role in psychotherapy 7 8 the scientific study of dreams is called oneirology 9 most modern dream study focuses on the neurophysiology of dreams and on proposing and testing hypotheses regarding dream function it is not known where in the brain dreams originate if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple regions of the brain are involved or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind the human dream experience and what to make of it has undergone sizable shifts over the course of history 10 11 long ago according to writings from mesopotamia and ancient egypt dreams dictated post dream behaviors to an extent sharply reduced in later millennia these ancient writings about dreams highlight visitation dreams where a dream figure usually a deity or a prominent forebear commands the dreamer to take specific actions and may predict future events 12 13 14 framing the dream experience varies across cultures as well as through time dreaming and sleep are intertwined dreams occur mainly in the rapid eye movement rem stage of sleep when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake because rem sleep is detectable in many species and because research suggests that all mammals experience rem 15 linking dreams to rem sleep has led to conjectures that animals dream however humans dream during non rem sleep also and not all rem awakenings elicit dream reports 16 to be studied a dream must first be reduced to a verbal report which is an account of the subject s memory of the dream not the subject s dream experience itself so dreaming by non humans is currently unprovable as is dreaming by human fetuses and pre verbal infants 17 contents 1 subjective experience 2

civilizations indicate a relatively abrupt change in subjective dream experience between bronze age antiquity and the beginnings of the classical era 18 in visitation dreams reported in ancient writings dreamers were largely passive in their dreams and visual content served primarily to frame authoritative auditory messaging 19 10 20 gudea the king of the sumerian city state of lagash reigned c 2144 2124 bce rebuilt the temple of ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so 6 after antiquity the passive hearing of visitation dreams largely gave way to visualized narratives in which the dreamer becomes a character who actively participates from the 1940s to 1985 calvin s hall collected more than 50 000 dream reports at western reserve university in 1966 hall and robert van de castle published the content analysis of dreams in which they outlined a coding system to study 1 000 dream reports from college students 21 results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content the only residue of antiquity s authoritative dream figure in the hall and van de castle listing of dream characters is the inclusion of god in the category of prominent persons 22 hall s complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid 1990s by his protégé william domhoff more recent studies of dream reports while providing more detail continue to cite the hall study favorably 23 a soldier dreams the trenches of wwi jan styka 1858 1925 in the hall study the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety other emotions included abandonment anger fear joy and happiness negative emotions were much more common than positive ones 21 the hall data analysis showed that sexual dreams occur no more than 10 of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid teens 21 another study showed that 8 of both men s and women s dreams have sexual content 24 in some cases sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions these are colloquially known as wet dreams 25 the visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric that is different locations and objects continuously blend into each other the visuals including locations people and objects are generally reflective of a person s memories and experiences but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new complex worlds and awakes with ideas thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream people who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams their dream contents are related to other senses like hearing touch smell and taste whichever are present since birth 26 neurophysiology main article cognitive neuroscience of dreams further information neuroscience of sleep dream study is popular with scientists exploring the mind brain problem some propose to reduce aspects of dream phenomenology to neurobiology 27 but current science cannot specify dream physiology in detail protocols in most nations restrict human brain research to non invasive procedures in the united states invasive brain procedures with a human subject are allowed only when these are deemed necessary in surgical treatment to address medical needs of the same human subject 28 non invasive measures of brain activity like electroencephalogram eeg voltage averaging or cerebral blood flow cannot identify small but influential neuronal populations 29 also fmri signals are too slow to explain how brains compute in real time 30 scientists researching some brain functions can work around current restrictions by examining animal subjects as stated by the society for neuroscience because no adequate alternatives exist much of this research must be done on animal subjects 31 however since animal dreaming can be only inferred not confirmed animal studies yield no hard facts to illuminate the neurophysiology of dreams examining human subjects with brain lesions can provide clues but the lesion method cannot discriminate between the effects of destruction and disconnection and cannot target specific neuronal groups in heterogeneous regions like the brain stem 29 generation the knight s dream 1655 by antonio de pereda denied precision tools obliged to depend on imaging much dream research has succumbed to the law of the instrument studies detect an increase of blood flow in a specific brain region and then credit that region with a role in generating dreams but pooling study results has led to the newer conclusion that dreaming involves large numbers of regions and pathways which likely are different for different dream events 32 image creation in the brain involves significant neural activity downstream from eye intake and it is theorized that the visual imagery of dreams is produced by activation during sleep of the same structures that generate complex visual imagery in waking perception 33 dreams present a running narrative rather than exclusively visual imagery following their work with split brain subjects gazzaniga and ledoux postulated without attempting to specify the neural mechanisms a left brain interpreter that seeks to create a plausible narrative from whatever electro chemical signals reach the brain s left hemisphere sleep research has determined that some brain regions fully active during waking are during rem sleep activated only in a partial or fragmentary way 34 drawing on this knowledge textbook author james w kalat explains a dream represents the brain s effort to make sense of sparse and distorted information the cortex combines this haphazard input with whatever other activity was already occurring and does its best to synthesize a story that makes sense of the information 35 neuroscientist indre viskontas is even more blunt calling often bizarre dream content just the result of your interpreter trying to create a story out of random neural signaling 36 theories on function main article oneirology further information rapid eye movement sleep for humans in the pre classical era and continuing for some non literate populations into modern times dreams are believed to have functioned as revealers of truths sourced during sleep from gods or other external entities 37 11 ancient egyptians believed that dreams were the best way to receive divine revelation and thus they would induce or incubate dreams they went to sanctuaries and slept on special dream beds in hope of receiving advice comfort or healing from the gods 14 from a darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement provide some benefit for natural selection to take place or at least have no negative impact on fitness robert 1886 38 a physician from hamburg was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase a sensory impressions that were not fully worked up and b ideas that were not fully developed during the day in dreams incomplete material is either removed suppressed or deepened and included into memory freud whose dream studies focused on interpreting dreams not explaining how or why humans dream disputed robert s hypothesis 39 and proposed that dreams preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled those wishes that otherwise would awaken the dreamer 40 freud wrote that dreams serve the purpose of prolonging sleep instead of waking up dreams are the guardians of sleep and not its disturbers 41 grandmother and granddaughter dream 1839 or 1840 taras shevchenko a turning point in theorizing about dream function came in 1953 when science published the aserinsky and kleitman paper 42 establishing rem sleep as a distinct phase of sleep and linking dreams to rem sleep 43 until and even after publication of the solms 2000 paper that certified the separability of rem sleep and dream phenomena 16 many studies purporting to uncover the function of dreams have in fact been studying not dreams but measurable rem sleep theories of dream function since the identification of rem sleep include hobson s and mccarley s 1977 activation synthesis hypothesis which proposed a functional role for dreaming sleep in promoting some aspect of the learning process 44 in 2010 a harvard study was published showing experimental evidence that dreams were correlated with improved learning 45 crick s and mitchison s 1983 reverse learning theory which states that dreams are like the cleaning up operations of computers when they are offline removing suppressing parasitic nodes and other junk from the mind during sleep 46 47 hartmann s 1995 proposal that dreams serve a quasi therapeutic function enabling the dreamer to process trauma in a safe place 48 revonsuo s 2000 threat simulation hypothesis whose premise is that during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats were serious giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them dreaming aided survival by replicating these threats and providing the dreamer with practice in dealing with them 49 eagleman s and vaughn s 2021 defensive activation theory which says that given the brain s neuroplasticity dreams evolved as a visual hallucinatory activity during sleep s extended periods of darkness busying the occipital lobe and thereby protecting it from possible appropriation by other non vision sense operations 50 religious and other cultural contexts dreams figure prominently in major world religions the dream experience for early humans according to one interpretation gave rise to the notion of a human soul 51 a central element in much religious thought j w dunne wrote but there can be no reasonable doubt that the idea of a soul must have first arisen in the mind of primitive man as a result of observation of his dreams ignorant as he was he could have come to no other conclusion but that in dreams he left his sleeping body in one universe and went wandering off into another it is considered that but for that savage the idea of such a thing as a soul would never have even occurred to mankind 52 hindu in the mandukya upanishad part of the veda scriptures of indian hinduism a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state 53 the earliest upanishads written before 300 bce emphasize two meanings of dreams the first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires the second is the belief of the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened abrahamic jacob s dream of a ladder of angels c 1690 michael willmann in judaism dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered it is discussed in the talmud tractate berachot 55 60 the ancient hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion though the hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the voice of one god alone hebrews also differentiated between good dreams from god and bad dreams from evil spirits the hebrews like many other ancient cultures incubated dreams in order to receive a divine revelation for example the hebrew prophet samuel would lie down and sleep in the temple at shiloh before the ark and receive the word of the lord most of the dreams in the bible are in the book of genesis 54 christians mostly shared the beliefs of the hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the old testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration the most famous of these dream stories was jacob s dream of a ladder that stretches from earth to heaven many christians preach that god can speak to people through their dreams the famous glossary the somniale danielis written in the name of daniel attempted to teach christian populations to interpret their dreams iain r edgar has researched the role of dreams in islam 55 he has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of islam and the lives of muslims since dream interpretation is the only way that muslims can receive revelations from god since the death of the last prophet muhammad 56 according to edgar islam classifies three types of dreams firstly there is the true dream al ru ya then the false dream which may come from the devil shaytan and finally the meaningless everyday dream hulm this last dream could be brought forth by the dreamer s ego or base appetite based on what they experienced in the real world the true dream is often indicated by islam s hadith tradition 56 in one narration by aisha the wife of the prophet it is said that the prophet s dreams would come true like the ocean s waves 56 just as in its predecessors the quran also recounts the story of joseph and his unique ability to interpret dreams 56 buddhist in buddhism ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions in south asia the same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people as in the case of the buddha to be before he is leaving his home it is described in the mahāvastu that several of the buddha s relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this some dreams are also seen to transcend time the buddha to be has certain dreams that are the same as those of previous buddhas the lalitavistara states in buddhist literature dreams often function as a signpost motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character 57 buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the pāli commentaries and the milinda pañhā 57 other dreaming of the tiger spring 虎跑夢泉 statue at hupao spring hupaomengquan in hangzhou zhejiang china in chinese history people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream realm while the other remained in the body 58 this belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since early times such as by the philosopher wang chong 27 97 ce 58 the babylonians and assyrians divided dreams into good which were sent by the gods and bad sent by demons 59 a surviving collection of dream omens entitled iškar zaqīqu records various dream scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person who experiences each dream apparently based on previous cases 6 60 some list different possible outcomes based on occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different results 6 the greeks shared their beliefs with the egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams and the idea of incubating dreams morpheus the greek god of dreams also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples the earliest greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers where they entered through a keyhole exiting the same way after the divine message was given antiphon wrote the first known greek book on dreams in the 5th century bce in that century other cultures influenced greeks to develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body 61 hippocrates 469 399 bce had a simple dream theory during the day the soul receives images during the night it produces images greek philosopher aristotle 384 322 bce believed dreams caused physiological activity he thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases marcus tullius cicero for his part believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days 62 cicero s somnium scipionis described a lengthy dream vision which in turn was commented on by macrobius in his commentarii in somnium scipionis herodotus in his the histories writes the visions that occur to us in dreams are more often than not the things we have been concerned about during the day 63 the dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous australians for a personal or group creation and for what may be understood as the timeless time of formative creation and perpetual creating 64 some indigenous american tribes and mexican populations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their ancestors 65 some native american tribes have used vision quests as a rite of passage fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return 66 67 interpretation main article dream interpretation further information psychoanalysis and precognition joseph interprets pharaoh s dream c 1896 1902 jacques joseph tissot 1836 1902 beginning in the late 19th century austrian neurologist sigmund freud founder of psychoanalysis theorized that dreams reflect the dreamer s unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment he argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences 7 carl jung and others expanded on freud s idea that dream content reflects the dreamer s unconscious desires dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences one study found that most people believe that their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths 68 the researchers surveyed students in the united states south korea and india and found that 74 of indians 65 of south koreans and 56 of americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires this freudian view of dreaming was believed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation problem solving or as a byproduct of unrelated brain activity the same study found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying while awake and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take participants in the study were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake they were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked for example and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked according to surveys it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events 69 psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of memory biases namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences 69 the multi faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events 70 the term veridical dream has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer whether future events or secrets 71 in one experiment subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary this prevented the selective memory effect and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future 72 another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams this diary described events from the person s life as well as some predictive dreams and some non predictive dreams when subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones 73 images and literature main article dream art further information dream world plot device graphic artists writers and filmmakers all have found dreams to offer a rich vein for creative expression in the west artists depictions of dreams in renaissance and baroque art often were related to biblical narrative especially preferred by visual artists were the jacob s ladder dream in genesis and st joseph s dreams in the gospel according to matthew nicolas dipre le songe de jacob c 1500 avignon petit palais josé de ribera 1591 1652 el sueño de jacob from prado in google earth raphael jacob s dream 1518 rembrandt dream of joseph 1645 anton raphael mengs traum des hl joseph 1773 or 1774 many later graphic artists have depicted dreams including japanese woodblock artist hokusai 1760 1849 and western european painters rousseau 1844 1910 picasso 1881 1973 and dali 1904 1989 in literature dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative the book of the duchess 74 and the vision concerning piers plowman 75 are two such dream visions even before them in antiquity the same device had been used by cicero and lucian of samosata the cheshire cat john tenniel 1820 1914 illustration in alice s adventures in wonderland 1866 edition dreams have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the 19th century one of the best known dream worlds is wonderland from lewis carroll s alice s adventures in wonderland as well as looking glass land from its sequel through the looking glass unlike many dream worlds carroll s logic is like that of actual dreams with transitions and flexible causality other fictional dream worlds include the dreamlands of h p lovecraft s dream cycle 76 and the neverending story s 77 world of fantastica which includes places like the desert of lost dreams the sea of possibilities and the swamps of sadness dreamworlds shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by philip k dick such as the three stigmata of palmer eldritch and ubik similar themes were explored by jorge luis borges for instance in the circular ruins modern popular culture often conceives of dreams as did freud as expressions of the dreamer s deepest fears and desires 78 in speculative fiction the line between dreams and reality may be blurred even more in service to the story 79 dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated dreamscape 1984 the nightmare on elm street films 1984 2010 inception 2010 or even come literally true as in the lathe of heaven 1971 78 lucidity main article lucid dream lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one s state while dreaming in this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as lucid a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming 80 the occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified 81 oneironaut is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream in 1975 psychologist keith hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream on april 12 1975 after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid the subject and hearne s co author on the resulting article alan worsley successfully carried out this task 82 years later psychophysiologist stephen laberge conducted similar work including using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake and while dreaming studies comparing in dream sex arousal and orgasm 83 communication between two dreamers has also been documented the processes involved included eeg monitoring ocular signaling incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website the website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream this dreamer upon becoming lucid signaled with eye movements this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer invoking incorporation into that dreamer s dream 84 recollection further information dream diary raphael s dream 1821 johannes riepenhausen and franz riepenhausen the recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable though it is a skill that can be trained dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming 85 women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men 85 dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect and factors such as salience arousal and interference play a role in dream recall often a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus the salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient that is novel intense or unusual is more easily remembered there is considerable evidence that vivid intense or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled 86 a dream journal can be used to assist dream recall for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes adults report remembering around two dreams per week on average 87 88 unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it the content of the dream is typically not remembered 89 recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall using the permitted non invasive technologies functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri and electromyography emg researchers have been able to identify basic dream imagery 90 dream speech activity 91 and dream motor behavior such as walking and hand movements 92 93 in line with the salience hypothesis there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid intense or unusual dreams show better recall there is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall specifically people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall people who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity imagination and fantasy such as openness to experience daydreaming fantasy proneness absorption and hypnotic susceptibility tend to show more frequent dream recall 86 there is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience that is people who report more bizarre experiences during the day such as people high in schizotypy psychosis proneness have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares 86 miscellany illusion of reality main article dream argument some philosophers have proposed that what we think of as the real world could be or is an illusion an idea known as the skeptical hypothesis about ontology the first recorded mention of the idea was in the 4th century bce by zhuangzi and in eastern philosophy the problem has been named the zhuangzi paradox he who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt while he is dreaming he does not know it is a dream and in his dream he may even try to interpret a dream only after he wakes does he know it was a dream and someday there will be a great awakening when we know that this is all a great dream yet the stupid believe they are awake busily and brightly assuming they understand things calling this man ruler that one herdsman how dense confucius and you are both dreaming and when i say you are dreaming i am dreaming too words like these will be labeled the supreme swindle yet after ten thousand generations a great sage may appear who will know their meaning and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed 94 the idea also is discussed in hindu and buddhist writings 95 it was formally introduced to western philosophy by descartes in the 17th century in his meditations on first philosophy absent minded transgression dreams of absent minded transgression damt are dreams wherein the dreamer absent mindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette subjects who have had damt have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt one study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior 96 daydreams main article daydream dante meditating 1852 by joseph noel paton a daydream is a visionary fantasy especially one of happy pleasant thoughts hopes or ambitions imagined as coming to pass and experienced while awake 97 there are many different types of daydreams and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists 97 the general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences research by harvard psychologist deirdre barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental images reserve the word for these whereas many other people refer to milder imagery realistic future planning review of memories or just spacing out i e one s mind going relatively blank when they talk about daydreaming 98 99 while daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy non productive pastime it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts 100 there are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers such as composers novelists and filmmakers developing new ideas through daydreaming similarly research scientists mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas hallucination main article hallucination a hallucination in the broadest sense of the word is a perception in the absence of a stimulus in a stricter sense hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state in the absence of external stimuli and have qualities of real perception in that they are vivid substantial and located in external objective space the latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming which does not involve wakefulness nightmare main article nightmare woman having a nightmare jean pierre simon 1764 1810 or 1813 a nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind typically fear or horror but also despair anxiety and great sadness the dream may contain situations of danger discomfort psychological or physical terror sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a prolonged period of time 101 night terror main article night terror a night terror also known as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus is a parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children causing feelings of terror or dread night terrors should not be confused with nightmares which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear 102 déjà vu main article déjà vu one theory of déjà vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake 103 see also psychology portal cognitive neuroscience of

disambiguation the fallen angel 1847 by alexandre cabanel lucifer a is one of various figures in folklore associated with the planet venus the entity s name was subsequently absorbed into christianity as a name for the devil modern scholarship generally translates the term in the relevant bible passage isaiah 14 12 where the greek septuagint reads ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωὶ as morning star or shining one rather than as a proper noun lucifer as found in the latin vulgate as a name for the devil in christian theology the more common meaning in english lucifer is the rendering of the hebrew word ה יל ל hêlēl pronunciation hay lale 1 in isaiah 2 given in the king james version of the bible the translators of this version took the word from the latin vulgate 3 which translated ה יל ל by the latin word lucifer uncapitalized 4 5 meaning the morning star the planet venus or as an adjective light bringing 6 as a name for the planet in its morning aspect lucifer light bringer is a proper noun and is capitalized in english in greco roman civilization it was often personified and considered a god 7 and in some versions considered a son of aurora the dawn 8 a similar name used by the roman poet catullus for the planet in its evening aspect is noctifer night bringer 9 contents 1 roman folklore and etymology 2 planet venus sumerian folklore and fall from heaven motif 3 christianity 3 1 in the

6 modern popular culture 7 see also 8 notes 9 references 10 further reading 11 external links roman folklore and etymology edit lucifer the morning star represented as a winged child pouring light from a jar engraving by g h frezza 1704 in roman folklore lucifer light bringer in latin was the name of the planet venus though it was often personified as a male figure bearing a torch the greek name for this planet was variously phosphoros also meaning light bringer or heosphoros meaning dawn bringer 10 lucifer was said to be the fabled son of aurora 11 and cephalus and father of ceyx he was often presented in poetry as heralding the dawn 10 planet venus in alignment with mercury above and the moon below the latin word corresponding to greek phosphoros is lucifer it is used in its astronomical sense both in prose b c and poetry d e poets sometimes personify the star placing it in a mythological context f g lucifer s mother aurora is cognate to the vedic goddess ushas lithuanian goddess aušrinė and greek eos all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn all four are considered derivatives of the proto indo european stem h₂ewsṓs 19 later ausṓs dawn a stem that also gave rise to proto germanic austrō old germanic ōstara and old english ēostre ēastre this agreement leads to the reconstruction of a proto indo european dawn goddess 20 the 2nd century roman mythographer pseudo hyginus said of the planet 21 the fourth star is that of venus luciferus by name some say it is juno s in many tales it is recorded that it is called hesperus too it seems to be the largest of all stars some have said it represents the son of aurora and cephalus who surpassed many in beauty so that he even vied with venus and as eratosthenes says for this reason it is called the star of venus it is visible both at dawn and sunset and so properly has been called both luciferus and hesperus the latin poet ovid in his 1st century epic metamorphoses describes lucifer as ordering the heavens 22 aurora watchful in the reddening dawn threw wide her crimson doors and rose filled halls the stellae took flight in marshaled order set by lucifer who left his station last ovid speaking of phosphorus and hesperus the evening star the evening appearance of the planet venus as identical makes him the father of daedalion 23 ovid also makes him the father of ceyx 24 25 while the latin grammarian servius makes him the father of the hesperides or of hesperis 26 in the classical roman period lucifer was not typically regarded as a deity and had few if any myths 10 though the planet was associated with various deities and often poetically personified cicero pointed out that you say that sol the sun and luna the moon are deities and the greeks identify the former with apollo and the latter with diana but if luna the moon is a goddess then lucifer the morning star also and the rest of the wandering stars stellae errantes will have to be counted gods and if so then the fixed stars stellae inerrantes as well 27 planet venus sumerian folklore and fall from heaven motif edit main article venus in culture canaanite mythology the motif of a heavenly being striving for the highest seat of heaven only to be cast down to the underworld has its origins in the motions of the planet venus known as the morning star the sumerian goddess inanna babylonian ishtar is associated with the planet venus and inanna s actions in several of her myths including inanna and shukaletuda and inanna s descent into the underworld appear to parallel the motion of venus as it progresses through its synodic cycle 28 29 30 31 a similar theme is present in the babylonian myth of etana the jewish encyclopedia comments the brilliancy of the morning star which eclipses all other stars but is not seen during the night may easily have given rise to a myth such as was told of ethana and zu he was led by his pride to strive for the highest seat among the star gods on the northern mountain of the gods but was hurled down by the supreme ruler of the babylonian olympus 32 the fall from heaven motif also has a parallel in canaanite mythology in ancient canaanite religion the morning star is personified as the god attar who attempted to occupy the throne of ba al and finding he was unable to do so descended and ruled the underworld 33 34 the original myth may have been about the lesser god helel trying to dethrone the canaanite high god el who lived on a mountain to the north 35 36 hermann gunkel s reconstruction of the myth told of a mighty warrior called hêlal whose ambition was to ascend higher than all the other stellar divinities but who had to descend to the depths it thus portrayed as a battle the process by which the bright morning star fails to reach the highest point in the sky before being faded out by the rising sun 37 however the eerdmans commentary on the bible argues that no evidence has been found of any canaanite myth or imagery of a god being forcibly thrown from heaven as in the book of isaiah see below it argues that the closest parallels with isaiah s description of the king of babylon as a fallen morning star cast down from heaven are to be found not in canaanite myths but in traditional ideas of the jewish people echoed in the biblical account of the fall of adam and eve cast out of god s presence for wishing to be as god and the picture in psalm 82 of the gods and sons of the most high destined to die and fall 38 this jewish tradition has echoes also in jewish pseudepigrapha such as 2 enoch and the life of adam and eve 32 39 the life of adam and eve in turn shaped the idea of iblis in the quran 40 the greek myth of phaethon a personification of the planet jupiter 41 follows a similar pattern 37 christianity edit in the bible edit in the book of isaiah chapter 14 the king of babylon is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet isaiah and is called ה יל ל ב ן ש ח ר helel ben shachar hebrew for shining one son of the morning 38 who is addressed as הילל בן שחר hêlêl ben šāḥar 42 43 44 45 the title hêlêl ben šāḥar refers to the planet venus as the morning star and that is how the hebrew word is usually interpreted 46 47 the hebrew word transliterated as hêlêl 48 or heylel 49 occurs only once in the hebrew bible 48 the septuagint renders ה יל ל in greek as ἑωσφόρος 50 51 52 53 54 heōsphoros 55 56 bringer of dawn the ancient greek name for the morning star 57 similarly the vulgate renders ה יל ל in latin as lucifer the name in that language for the morning star according to the king james bible based strong s concordance the original hebrew word means shining one light bearer and the english translation given in the king james text is the latin name for the planet venus lucifer 49 as it was already in the wycliffe bible however the translation of ה יל ל as lucifer has been abandoned in modern english translations of isaiah 14 12 present day translations render ה יל ל as morning star new international version new century version new american standard bible good news translation holman christian standard bible contemporary english version common english bible complete jewish bible daystar new jerusalem bible the message day star new revised standard version english standard version shining one new life version new world translation jps tanakh or shining star new living translation in a modern translation from the original hebrew the passage in which the phrase lucifer or morning star occurs begins with the statement on the day the lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you you will take up this taunt against the king of babylon how the oppressor has come to an end how his fury has ended 58 after describing the death of the king the taunt continues how you have fallen from heaven morning star son of the dawn you have been cast down to the earth you who once laid low the nations you said in your heart i will ascend to the heavens i will raise my throne above the stars of god i will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly on the utmost heights of mount zaphon i will ascend above the tops of the clouds i will make myself like the most high but you are brought down to the realm of the dead to the depths of the pit those who see you stare at you they ponder your fate is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble the man who made the world a wilderness who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home 59 for the unnamed king of babylon 60 a wide range of identifications have been proposed 61 they include a babylonian ruler of the prophet isaiah s own time 61 the later nebuchadnezzar ii under whom the babylonian captivity of the jews began 62 or nabonidus 61 63 and the assyrian kings tiglath pileser sargon ii and sennacherib 64 65 verse 20 says that this king of babylon will not be joined with them all the kings of the nations in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land thou hast slain thy people the seed of evil doers shall not be named for ever but rather be cast out of the grave while all the kings of the nations all of them sleep in glory every one in his own house 46 66 herbert wolf held that the king of babylon was not a specific ruler but a generic representation of the whole line of rulers 67 isaiah 14 12 became a source for the popular conception of the fallen angel motif 68 rabbinical judaism has rejected any belief in rebel or fallen angels 69 in the 11th century the pirkei de rabbi eliezer illustrates the origin of the fallen angel myth by giving two accounts one relates to the angel in the garden of eden who seduces eve and the other relates to the angels the benei elohim who cohabit with the daughters of man genesis 6 1 4 70 an association of isaiah 14 12 18 with a personification of evil called the devil developed outside of mainstream rabbinic judaism in pseudepigrapha and christian writings 71 particularly with the apocalypses 72 as the devil edit main article devil in christianity illustration of lucifer in the first fully illustrated print edition of dante alighieri s divine comedy woodcut for inferno canto 33 pietro di piasi venice 1491 the metaphor of the morning star that isaiah 14 12 applied to a king of babylon gave rise to the general use of the latin word for morning star capitalized as the original name of the devil before his fall from grace linking isaiah 14 12 with luke 10 i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven 73 and interpreting the passage in isaiah as an allegory of satan s fall from heaven 74 75 considering pride as a major sin peaking in self deification lucifer hêlêl became the template for the devil 76 as a result lucifer was identified with the devil in christianity and in christian popular literature 3 as in dante alighieri s inferno joost van den vondel s lucifer and john milton s paradise lost 77 early medieval christianity fairly distinguished between lucifer and satan while lucifer as the devil is fixated in hell satan executes the desires of lucifer as his vassal 78 79 interpretations edit gustave doré illustration to paradise lost book ix 179 187 he satan held on his midnight search where soonest he might finde the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found j mehoffer fallen lucifer and the hound of hell aquila of sinope derives the word hêlêl the hebrew name for the morning star from the verb yalal to lament this derivation was adopted as a proper name for an angel who laments the loss of his former beauty 80 the christian church fathers for example hieronymus in his vulgate translated this as lucifer the equation of lucifer with the fallen angel probably occurred in 1st century palestinian judaism the church fathers brought the fallen lightbringer lucifer into connection with the devil on the basis of a saying of jesus in the gospel of luke 10 18 eu i saw satan fall from heaven like lightning 81 some christian writers have applied the name lucifer as used in the book of isaiah and the motif of a heavenly being cast down to the earth to the devil sigve k tonstad argues that the new testament war in heaven theme of revelation 12 in which the dragon who is called the devil and satan was thrown down to the earth was derived from the passage about the babylonian king in isaiah 14 82 origen 184 185 253 254 interpreted such old testament passages as being about manifestations of the devil 83 84 85 origen was not the first to interpret the isaiah 14 passage as referring to the devil he was preceded by at least tertullian c 160 c 225 who in his adversus marcionem book 5 chapters 11 and 17 twice presents as spoken by the devil the words of isaiah 14 14 i will ascend above the tops of the clouds i will make myself like the most high 86 87 88 though tertullian was a speaker of the language in which the word lucifer was created lucifer is not among the numerous names and phrases he used to describe the devil 89 even at the time of the latin writer augustine of hippo 354 430 a contemporary of the composition of the vulgate lucifer had not yet become a common name for the devil 90 augustine of hippo s work civitas dei 5th century became the major opinion of western demonology including in the catholic church for augustine the rebellion of the devil was the first and final cause of evil by this he rejected some earlier teachings about satan having fallen when the world was already created 91 further augustine rejects the idea that envy could have been the first sin as some early christians believed evident from sources like cave of treasures in which satan has fallen because he envies humans and refused to prostrate himself before adam since pride loving yourself more than others and god is required to be envious hatred for the happiness of others 92 he argues that evil came first into existence by the free will of lucifer 93 lucifer s attempt to take god s throne is not an assault on the gates of heaven but a turn to solipsism in which the devil becomes god in his world 94 when the king of babel uttered his phrase in isaiah he was speaking through the spirit of lucifer the head of devils he concluded that everyone who falls away from god are within the body of lucifer and is a devil 95 adherents of the king james only movement and others who hold that isaiah 14 12 does indeed refer to the devil have decried the modern translations 96 97 98 99 100 101 an opposing view attributes to origen the first identification of the lucifer of isaiah 14 12 with the devil and to tertullian and augustine of hippo the spread of the story of lucifer as fallen through pride envy of god and jealousy of humans 102 protestant theologian john calvin rejected the identification of lucifer with satan or the devil he said the exposition of this passage which some have given as if it referred to satan has arisen from ignorance for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the babylonians 103 martin luther also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil 104 counter reformation writers like albertanus of brescia classified the seven deadly sins each to a specific biblical demon 105 he as well as peter binsfield assigned lucifer to the sin pride 106 gnosticism edit since lucifer s sin mainly consists of self deification some gnostic sects identified lucifer with the creator deity in the old testament 107 in the bogomil and cathar text gospel of the secret supper lucifer is a glorified angel but fell from heaven to establish his own kingdom and became the demiurge who created the material world and trapped souls from heaven inside matter jesus descended to earth to free the captured souls 108 109 in contrast to mainstream christianity the cross was denounced as a symbol of lucifer and his instrument in an attempt to kill jesus 110 latter day saint movement edit lucifer is regarded within the latter day saint movement as the pre mortal name of the devil mormon theology teaches that in a heavenly council lucifer rebelled against the plan of god the father and was subsequently cast out 111 the doctrine and covenants reads and this we saw also and bear record that an angel of god who was in authority in the presence of god who rebelled against the only begotten son whom the father loved and who was in the bosom of the father was thrust down from the presence of god and the son and was called perdition for the heavens wept over him he was lucifer a son of the morning and we beheld and lo he is fallen is fallen even a son of the morning and while we were yet in the spirit the lord commanded us that we should write the vision for we beheld satan that old serpent even the devil who rebelled against god and sought to take the kingdom of our god and his christ wherefore he maketh war with the saints of god and encompasseth them round about doctrine and covenants 76 25 29 112 after becoming satan by his fall lucifer goeth up and down to and fro in the earth seeking to destroy the souls of men 113 members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints consider isaiah 14 12 to be referring to both the king of the babylonians and the devil 114 115 other occurrences edit anthroposophy edit rudolf steiner s writings which formed the basis for anthroposophy characterised lucifer as a spiritual opposite to ahriman with christ between the two forces mediating a balanced path for humanity lucifer represents an intellectual imaginative delusional otherworldly force which might be associated with visions subjectivity psychosis and fantasy he associated lucifer with the religious philosophical cultures of egypt rome and greece steiner believed that lucifer as a supersensible being had incarnated in china about 3000 years before the birth of christ luciferianism edit luciferianism is a belief structure that venerates the fundamental traits that are attributed to lucifer the custom inspired by the teachings of gnosticism usually reveres lucifer not as the devil but as a savior a guardian or instructing spirit 116 or even the true god as opposed to jehovah 117 in anton lavey s the satanic bible lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell particularly that of the east the lord of the air and is called the bringer of light the morning star intellectualism and enlightenment 118 freemasonry edit léo taxil 1854 1907 claimed that freemasonry is associated with worshipping lucifer in what is known as the taxil hoax he alleged that leading freemason albert pike had addressed the 23 supreme confederated councils of the world an invention of taxil instructing them that lucifer was god and was in opposition to the evil god adonai taxil promoted a book by diana vaughan actually written by himself as he later confessed publicly 119 that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the palladium which controlled the organization and had a satanic agenda as described by freemasonry disclosed in 1897 with frightening cynicism the miserable person we shall not name here taxil declared before an assembly especially convened for him that for twelve years he had prepared and carried out to the end the most sacrilegious of hoaxes we have always been careful to publish special articles concerning palladism and diana vaughan we are now giving in this issue a complete list of these articles which can now be considered as not having existed 120 supporters of freemasonry assert that when albert pike and other masonic scholars spoke about the luciferian path or the energies of lucifer they were referring to the morning star the light bearer the search for light the very antithesis of dark pike says in morals and dogma lucifer the son of the morning is it he who bears the light and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble sensual or selfish souls doubt it not 121 much has been made of this quote 122 taxil s work and pike s address continue to be quoted by anti masonic groups 123 in devil worship in france arthur edward waite compared taxil s work to today s tabloid journalism replete with logical and factual inconsistencies neopagan witchcraft edit in a collection of folklore and magical practices supposedly collected in italy by charles godfrey leland and published in his aradia or the gospel of the witches the figure of lucifer is featured prominently as both the brother and consort of the goddess diana and father of aradia at the center of an alleged italian witch cult 124 in leland s mythology diana pursued her brother lucifer across the sky as a cat pursues a mouse according to leland after dividing herself into light and darkness diana saw that the light was so beautiful the light which was her other half her brother lucifer she yearned for it with exceeding great desire wishing to receive the light again into her darkness to swallow it up in rapture in delight she trembled with desire this desire was the dawn but lucifer the light fled from her and would not yield to her wishes he was the light which flies into the most distant parts of heaven the mouse which flies before the cat 125 here the motions of diana and lucifer once again mirror the celestial motions of the moon and venus respectively 126 though leland s lucifer is based on the classical personification of the planet venus he also incorporates elements from christian tradition as in the following passage diana greatly loved her brother lucifer the god of the sun and of the moon the god of light splendor who was so proud of his beauty and who for his pride was driven from paradise 125 in the several modern wiccan traditions based in part on leland s work the figure of lucifer is usually either omitted or replaced as diana s consort with either the etruscan god tagni or dianus janus following the work of folklorist james frazer in the golden bough 124 gallery edit lucifer by alessandro vellutello 1534 for dante s inferno canto 34 lucifer by william blake for dante s inferno canto 34 satan lucifer arousing rebel angels in milton

cold darkness on from high in the heavens shaking out her dewy hair her face blushing red at the pursuing sun from him roseate lucifer averts his fires lingering in the clouds and with reluctant horse

that he is there because of arcane who has escaped 10 it is eventually shown that he has returned to earth but since he is not the avatar of the rot he can only gain strength from consuming rotten items like corpses and garbage and as such is terribly weakened he joins forces with the new realm of metal which promises him the power that he lost and his power does grow greatly in this time he

forever as seen when his left hand and her right are completely fused in a twisted embrace and when he calls her his daughter wife in doing so he allowed himself to leech off her power as the true avatar of the rot and ensuring that the swamp thing could not fight him without risking harm or death to the one he loved however the swamp thing has made the decision to destroy the rot using the power of a life through a white lantern ring arcane attempts to dissuade him by citing the necessity of death and rot but the swamp thing counters it by saying that fungi the grey and bacteria the divided have already decided to take over the role of rot while metal will keep them in check arcane then tries to give up abigail but the swamp thing believes that there is enough life in her to let her survive and in the worst case death is better than the hell that she lives in arcane briefly tries to fight back but abigail makes her move to distract him long enough for the swamp thing to activate the white lantern ring and bringing about the death of anton arcane powers and abilities edit anton arcane possesses the knowledge of creating synthetic organs and skin from those he made his

johnny thunderbolt he continued in flash comics until issue 91 jan 1948 2 fictional character biography edit earth two version edit john l thunder is the seventh son of a seventh son born at 7 a m on saturday july 7 the seventh day of the week the seventh day of the seventh month in 1917 this causes him to be kidnapped by some brown men and sold to a group of men from the fictional country of badhnesia who had been looking for someone born at this time on this day 3 as an infant the blond haired johnny is given possession of the pink lightning haired genie like thunderbolt 4 named yz during a mystic ritual on his 7th birthday which was intended to allow the badhnesians to use johnny to rule the world however the plan is soon aborted after an attack from a neighboring country 5 johnny eventually returns to the united states and lives an ordinary life until one day while washing windows he inadvertently summons the thunderbolt with the magic words cei u pronounced say you when he calls for someone to throw him a sponge which he accidentally uses to become a successful boxer 6 johnny underwent several adventures each time inadvertently summoning the thunderbolt via the use of say you in his day to day conversation never realizing the thunderbolt who moved so fast he was virtually invisible was responsible for the extraordinary events that befell him before finally learning of the thunderbolt s existence 7 in issue 11 he finally notices the thunderbolt and figures out the magic word in issue 20 8 johnny lived with his parents dated his on again off again girlfriend daisy darling who had a somewhat less than scrupulous businessman father in 1941 he adopted a little freckle faced blond orphan girl named peachy pet who despite her cutesy name and clothing was a tough little girl who was much smarter than her new father 9 10 many times during his adventures which included a stint with the united states navy peachy would instruct her befuddled but beloved papa john on how and when to use the thunderbolt s magic powers the green suit and red bow tie clad johnny s appearances with the justice society of america and in his own solo adventures tended to be quite comedic as johnny s main personality trait was being fairly dimwitted which prompts his much smarter thunderbolt to possess a sarcastic if patient attitude toward his boss while knowing full well that he could not actually do anything until his master told him to johnny accidentally joined the justice society when wishing out loud that he could be a member and was immediately taken to their meeting by the thunderbolt despite recurring impatience with his stupidity his fellow jsaers genuinely valued johnny s good heartedness and dedication and considered him a friend furthermore the thunderbolt s vast power may have contributed to johnny s continued jsa membership his frequent blunders notwithstanding since the more competent heroes doubtlessly thought it wise to keep an eye on the pair whenever possible he finally became a member after the flash left and the group told him to capture mister x which he accidentally succeeded in doing like most of the jsa members he had his aging factor greatly slowed during an encounter with the villain ian karkull johnny s adventures ceased in the late 1940s when he was replaced in the justice society stories by a heroine he had begun teaming up with the black canary 11 the reason for his leaving the justice society is eventually explained to be that his control over his thunderbolt is weakening thanks to a spell cast by renegade badhnesian priests 12 in the early 1950s johnny is kidnapped again by agents from badhnesia with the intention of executing their original world conquest plan johnny manages to summon superman and the would be conquerors plans are defeated johnny spent some time in badhnesia afterwards teaching the native citizens about democracy 13 he returns home after the country elects its first president johnny joins the justice society on various adventures crisis on infinite earths and ragnarök edit following the maxiseries crisis on infinite earths was the one shot last days of the justice society of america special 1986 this book depicted the sacrifice of johnny and his jsa teammates as they left the new post crisis world and entered into a limbo dimension caused by the actions of adolf hitler in april 1945 a wave of destruction appears over earth even as it is settling down from the crisis in order to stop a literal ragnarök the heroes enter into an eternal battle and so leave the world earth one version edit prior to the crisis on infinite earths retcon an alternate version of johnny thunder existed on earth one this version was a simple petty criminal with no thunderbolt upon meeting the earth two thunder who had traveled to earth one out of curiosity the criminal johnny thunder knocked his counterpart out and seized control of the thunderbolt he uses it to temporarily reshape earth one such that several heroes such as superman batman and green lantern retroactively cease to exist the criminal exploits the fact that the thunderbolt is keyed to simply obey johnny thunder without any distinction made between alternate versions leaving the thunderbolt obligated to obey whichever johnny is conscious despite his own morality however the thunderbolt often tries to work in loopholes to give the heroes an advantage such as informing the criminal that the justice society who had come to earth 1 to find out what had happened to their friends in the justice league had disappeared when they had in fact disguised themselves as the justice league to provoke johnny into revealing what had happened to their version or making a barrier which keeps out cops but not superheroes the earth 2 johnny is apparently placed in a coma by the thunderbolt s magic though this is not actually shown the alternate version of earth one that johnny creates is sometimes referred to as earth a earth alternate which johnny thinks up himself thunder s lawless league of evil people with powers like the justice league heroes which are made up of johnny s fellow criminals who were given the powers of the justice league members are defeated by the visiting justice society of earth two who had originally disguised themselves as the jla after learning of johnny s disappearance the society s greater experience allowing them to easily defeat their criminal counterparts they subsequently face off against johnny thunder on the moon and the three creatures that the thunderbolt creates medusa man who turns people into wood absorbo man who can absorb the powers of others and repello man who throws attacks back at their origins all of the members are defeated except for doctor fate he creates a golden mask over medusa man s face and sends the wooden mr terrific and atom at absorbo man who had absorbed green lantern s power meaning he is vulnerable to wood and is destroyed he uses repello magic on repello man which is repelled and destroys him when the fight comes down to a struggle between doctor fate and the thunderbolt johnny thunder is so battered about by the combatting magic wielders whose powers fail to do any actual damage to each other that he finally gives up his attempts to use the thunderbolt and wishes that none of these events had taken place 14 the two earths and their respective heroes are restored with the justice league mentioning their world s johnny thunder as a small time criminal at their meeting the johnny thunder of earth one would return as a threat in justice league of america 219 220 johnny s return edit the absence of the jsa and of johnny thunder did not last long in 1992 dc published armageddon inferno the

dollars and during his time fighting for the universe she had created peachy s frozen yogurt a very successful chain of which johnny is half owner and now very wealthy of greater import to johnny is his discovery that the bahdnesians have all but disappeared a visit to the island of bahdnesia now under the ownership of pol st germain proves that no bahdnesians are left there in issue 7 johnny

two genies interact and whether any one personality is dominant johnny s family is informed of his death and a funeral is held at valhalla a cemetery for superheroes the family does not know that he lives on as the thunderbolt the thunderbolt eventually stops displaying johnny s likeness while still speaking as him during the blackest night storyline johnny thunder s body is reanimated as part of

character in commedia dell arte for other uses see harlequin disambiguation arlecchino disambiguation and arlequin disambiguation the classical appearance of the harlequin stock character in the commedia dell arte of the 1670s complete with batte or slapstick a magic wand used by the character to change the scenery of the play maurice sand 1860 1 the harlequin today park bank at the fountain in pulsnitz germany harlequin ˈhɑːrləkwɪn italian arlecchino arlekˈkiːno lombard arleqin bergamasque pronunciation arleˈkiː is the best known of the zanni or comic servant characters from the italian commedia dell arte associated with the city of bergamo the role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by zan ganassa in the late 16th century 2 was definitively popularized by the italian actor tristano martinelli in paris in 1584 1585 3 and became a stock character after martinelli s death in 1630 the harlequin is characterized by his checkered costume his role is that of a light hearted nimble and astute servant often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest columbina with wit and resourcefulness often competing with the sterner and melancholic pierrot he later develops into a prototype of the romantic hero harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities as well as his name from a mischievous devil character in medieval passion plays the harlequin character first appeared in england early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the harlequinade developed in the early 18th century by john rich 4 as the harlequinade portion of the english dramatic genre pantomime developed harlequin was routinely paired with the character clown as developed by joseph grimaldi around 1800 clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated harlequin who became more of a romantic character the most influential portrayers of the harlequin character in victorian england were william payne and his sons the payne brothers the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s contents 1 origin of the name 2 history 3 characteristics and dramatic function 3 1 physicality 3 2 speech 3 3 dramatic function 4 variants 5 famous harlequins 6 english harlequinade and pantomime 7 see also 8 notes 9 bibliography 10 external links origin of the name edit further information herla erlking and alichino devil the name harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous devil or demon character in popular french passion plays it originates with an old french term herlequin hellequin first attested in the 11th century by the chronicler orderic vitalis who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of normandy france at night 5 6 these demons were led by a masked club wielding giant and they were known as familia herlequin var familia herlethingi this medieval french version of the germanic wild hunt mesnée d hellequin has been connected to the english figure of herla cyning host king german erlkönig 7 hellequin was depicted as a black faced emissary of the devil roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to hell the physical appearance of hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of harlequin s red and black mask 8 9 the name s origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century hellequin of boulogne who died fighting the normans and originated a legend of devils 10 in cantos xxi and xxii from dante s inferno there is a devil by the name of alichino 5 11 the similarities between the devil in dante s inferno and the arlecchino are more than cosmetic the prank like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects 11 the first known appearance on stage of hellequin is dated to 1262 the character of a masked and hooded devil in jeu da la feuillière by adam de la halle and it became a stock character in french passion plays 12 history edit a scene from the commedia dell arte played in france before a noble audience in 1571 or 1572 museum of bayeux pantalone is front and center while just to the right and slightly behind is harlequin in motley costume the oldest known version of harlequin s costume 13 14 the re interpretation of the devil stock character as a zanni character of the commedia dell arte took place in the 16th century in france 15 zan ganassa whose troupe is first mentioned in mantua in the late 1560s is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part 4 although there is little hard evidence to support it 16 ganassa performed in france in 1571 and if he did play the part there he left the field open for another actor to take up the role when he took his troupe to spain permanently in 1574 17 among the earliest depictions of the character are a flemish painting c 1571 1572 in the museum of bayeux 13 14 and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the fossard collection discovered by agne beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the nationalmuseum stockholm 18 tristano martinelli s harlequin costume as depicted in his compositions de rhétorique 1601 tristano martinelli is the first actor definitely known to have used the name harlequin or arlequin from french folklore and adapted it for the comic secondo zanni role and he probably first performed the part in france in or just before 1584 and only later did he bring the character to italy where he became known as arlecchino 19 the motley costume is sometimes attributed to martinelli who wore a linen costume of colourful patches and a hare tail on his cap to indicate cowardice martinelli s harlequin also had a black leather half mask a moustache and a pointed beard he was very successful even playing at court and becoming a favourite of henry iv of france to whom he addressed insolent monologues compositions de rhetorique de mr don arlequin 1601 20 martinelli s great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the zanni role along with the name of his character after his death in 1630 among others by nicolò zecca active c 1630 in bologna as well as turin and mantua 21 the character was also performed in paris at the comédie italienne in italian by giovan battista andreini and angelo costantini c 1654 1729 and in french as arlequin in the 1660s by dominique biancolelli it 1636 1688 who combined the zanni types making his arlecchino witty neat and fluent in a croaking voice which became as traditional as the squawk of punch 4 the italians were expelled from france in 1697 for satirizing king louis xiv s second wife madame de maintenon 22 but returned in 1716 after his death when tommaso antonio vicentini thomassin 1682 1739 became famous in the part 23 the rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the paris fashion of the 17th century by biancolelli characteristics and dramatic function edit harlequin at the pantomime theatre in tivoli gardens in copenhagen denmark physicality edit the primary aspect of arlecchino was his physical agility 5 8 24 he was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see the character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a cartwheel somersault or flip would spice up the movement 10 by contrast with the first zanni harlequin takes little or no part in the development of the plot he has the more arduous task of maintaining the even rhythm of the comedy as a whole he is therefore always on the go very agile and more acrobatic than any of the other masks oreglia giacomo 25 early characteristics of arlecchino paint the character as a second zanni servant from northern italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster 5 11 arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play 11 physically arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox s tail and a red and black mask 5 the mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead small eyes a snub nose hollow cheeks and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair 5 arlecchino is often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person 5 aside from his acrobatics arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as appearing humpbacked without artificial padding the ability to eat large amounts of food quickly using his wooden sword like a fan a parody of bel canto and several other techniques 5 speech edit one of the major distinctions of commedia dell arte is the use of regional languages 11 arlecchino s speech evolved with the character originally speaking in a bergamo dialect of lombard language the character adopted a mixture of french lombard and italian dialects when the character became more of a fixture in france so as to help the performers connect to the common masses 5 11 dramatic function edit various troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style personal preferences or even the particular scenario being performed he is typically cast as the servant of an innamorato or vecchio much to the detriment of the plans of his master arleqin often had a love interest in the person of columbina or in older plays any of the soubrette roles and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master occasionally arleqin would pursue the innamorata though rarely with success as in the recueil fossard of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo donna lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman he also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor his sexual appetite is essentially immediate and can be applied to any passing woman 26 between the 16th and 17th centuries arleqin gained some function as a politically aware character in the comèdie itlaienne arleqin would parody french tragedies as well comment on current events 5 variants edit harlequin 1888 1890 paul cézanne duchartre lists the following as variations on the harlequin role trivelino or trivelin name is said to mean tatterdemalion one of the oldest versions of harlequin dating to the 15th century costume almost identical to harlequin s but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons stars circles and triangles in 18th century france trivelino was a distinct character from harlequin they appeared together in a number of comedies by pierre de marivaux including l île des esclaves 27 truffa truffaldin or truffaldino popular characters with gozzi and goldoni but said to be best when used for improvisations by the 18th century was a bergamask caricature 27 guazzetto in the seventeenth century a variety of anonymous engravings show guazzetto rollicking similar to arleqin he wears a fox s brush a large three tiered collarette wide breeches and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt he also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape guazzetto s mask is characterized with a hooked nose and a mustache his bat is shaped like a scimitar esque sword 27 28 zaccagnino character dating to the 15th century bagatino a juggler pedrolino or pierotto a servant or valet clad in mostly white created by giovanni pellesini 27 famous harlequins edit marcello moretti 1910 61 photograph by amleto sartori 29 16th century 25 alberto naselli zan ganassa 17th century 30 tristano martinelli domenico biancolelli evaristo gherardi 18th century 30 pier francesco biancolelli tommaso visentini carlo bertinazzi 19th century william payne the payne brothers 20th century 30 marcello moretti the payne brothers harry left as clown and fred as harlequin c 1875 english harlequinade and pantomime edit the harlequin character came to england early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the harlequinade developed in the early 18th century by the lincoln s fields theatre s actor manager john rich who played the role under the name of lun 4 he developed the character of harlequin into a mischievous magician who was easily able to evade pantaloon and his servants to woo columbine harlequin used his magic batte or slapstick to transform the scene from the pantomime into the harlequinade and to magically change the settings to various locations during the chase scene 31 32 as the harlequinade portion of english pantomime developed harlequin was routinely paired with the character clown two developments in 1800 both involving joseph grimaldi greatly changed the pantomime characters 33 grimaldi starred as clown in charles dibdin s 1800 pantomime peter wilkins or harlequin in the flying world at sadler s wells theatre 34 35 for this elaborate production dibdin and grimaldi introduced new costume designs clown s costume was garishly colourful patterned with large diamonds and circles and fringed with tassels and ruffs instead of the tatty servant s outfit that had been used for a century the production was a hit and the new costume design was copied by others in london 35 later the same year at the theatre royal drury lane in harlequin amulet or the magick of mona harlequin was modified to become romantic and mercurial instead of mischievous leaving grimaldi s mischievous and brutish clown as the undisputed agent of chaos and the foil for the more sophisticated harlequin who retained and developed stylized dance poses during the 19th century 36 the most influential pair playing harlequin and clown in victorian england were the payne brothers active during the 1860s and 1870s 37 who contributed to the development of 20th century slapstick comedy citation needed see also edit harley

matthew sturges and fernando pasarin he did not appear again until issue 29 when he became a major character to the series he was only in four more issues before switching to the jsa all stars series

power girl king last appeared in the eighteenth issue of jsa all stars the final issue of the series creation and concept edit newsarama held an interview with matthew sturges the writer of jsa all stars to discuss the series sturges briefly talked about king chimera and how he wanted to re invent him off of king standish regarding standish sturges said you only saw him in disguise and so with this new king chimera it s a bit more metaphorical than that i ll just leave it at that 3 in another interview with newsarama sturges said king chimera is a new character that kind of exemplifies the attitude although he s an extreme case sturges also said that king wants to be the most effective hero he can be and will do anything to achieve that goal he also mentioned that king wants to be trained as well as possible and to take that training and use it effectively against the bad guys 4 fictional character biography edit in an origins and omens back up story flash visited king chimera in rome in which he said he knew his father and that he had arrived to talk to him about the justice society of america king replied well it s about time 5 king later appeared as billy armstrong s new roommate when they joined the jsa king demonstrated his power of casting illusions explaining that his father king standish was a master of disguise wanting to perfect the art of illusion standish met with a member of a secret order on a distant island the adepts of the order possessed the power to bend light and sound in order to cast illusions king mentioned that his mother was able to have this power as well while the jsa was in battle king billy and mr terrific stayed at the brownstone where billy had gone to mr terrific and stabbed him in the back 1 the jsa interrogated billy who claimed he didn t remember anything and was completely unaware of the situation king was then accused of making billy attack mr terrific with presumed mind control powers after the jsa watched their security tape which showed billy resisting against the attack 6 king was revealed to be innocent and that billy was actually a sociopath named jeremy karne and infiltrated the jsa to kidnap obsidian he stabbed mr terrific so he wouldn t figure out who he really was 7 jsa all stars edit king ended up with the jsa all stars team when the justice society decided to split up in two teams after jeremy s infiltration 8 his switch to the team quickly showed changes in his personality and later revealed some of his past which was never revealed in his first appearances in justice society of america he played a helpful role when the all stars were faced against johnny sorrow and the rest of the injustice society who had resurrected the king of tears a monstrous beast johnny had almost killed king by showing him his face 9 but king was saved from death by anna fortune 10 when the team went to the subtle realms to rescue stargirl from johnny who was transforming into a human king showed johnny an illusion of his face which severely injured him the team soon escaped back to their base after rescuing stargirl and destroying the king of tears 11 king then helped judomaster who was grieving over the death of damage by creating an illusion of damage s farewell message to her before his death which she had never finished hearing earlier this caused judomaster to not go with her plan to murder her father s killer tiger but instead subdued him and had him taken in by the police 12 past revealed edit although king s full past and origin are still a mystery bits of information were revealed about his past during a mission at parador when cyclone was severely injured anna transported her and king to a hospital of king s choice which was one located at ankara turkey while cyclone rested it was revealed by namita an illusion king created of his deceased former lover that she had died at the same hospital and that it was king s fault 13 it was also revealed by namita that king s mother villagers and monks were all dead due to king as well cyclone then woke up realizing that she felt better and that her wounds had already healed 2 king and cyclone were then seen helping the rest of the team in los angeles to fight the paradoran gods brainwave who was helping the all stars told the team that each one had to let something go from their past in order to weaken the power of the gods king was forced to let go of namita saying he could no longer love a ghost the all stars won the battle and king later made amends with cyclone as he had previously rejected their attraction toward each other before the mission at parador 14 later after finishing a dangerous mission in space king had confirmed his feelings for cyclone by kissing her 15 although namita stated it was due to king s brashness and conceit 2 it is unknown what he did that caused the deaths of namita his mother and the villagers and monks characterization edit king chimera was first portrayed as an arrogant egotistical classy know it all during his run in justice society of america king was impatient witty and quick to make a comeback even if he was not being insulted in the first place he found himself to be near perfection and thought of himself to be above everyone else due to his attitude king was not well perceived by his teammates however king did not seem to care as he stated that he was not with the justice society to make friends 16 only a few months later still early in his publication history king s attitude began to slowly change in the jsa all stars series beginning right after his near death experience with johnny sorrow he started to transition from his harsh attitude to a respected teammate he also started to show more respect towards his teammates by helping them out more with their problems specifically with judomaster while she was dealing with the grief of damage s death although king previously stated he was not with the team to make friends cyclone became his first and closest friend on the team although king s attitude has changed he still shows signs of cockiness but only toward his enemies depiction edit throughout all of his appearances king has sported a black suit with a double breasted jacket he wears a black necktie white gloves and black leather shoes he used to wear a golden handkerchief with a three point fold but in the jsa all stars series a golden medallion took its place when hourman once asked him why he wore a suit king made an illusion of himself in a spandex costume saying see how ridiculous i d look 17 powers and abilities edit king chimera was taught by his mother and or father to bend light and sound in order to cast illusions king explained to sand that his power is to conjure anything he has seen or heard into a chimera his power is to misdirect his enemies so they defeat themselves 11 king can also manipulate x rays which was shown when he made an illusion of himself being invisible and power girl could not see him even if she used her x ray vision 6 king possesses a genius intellect has an eidetic memory has highly trained senses and perfect recall 16 he is also skilled at hand to hand combat but the only move he uses on his enemies when he s not using his illusions is to flip them once sand asked why he didn t hit anyone and king replied i have my reasons 11 references edit a b justice society of

created by gardner fox and mike sekowsky 4 fictional character biography edit doctor destiny was once a petty criminal scientist who used his genius to create astounding devices for crime he first encountered the justice league of america shortly after he invented an anti gravity device and will deadener beam that allowed him to capture green lantern by luring him into his base using anti gravity discs to fly over the city as green lantern to impersonate and infiltrate the jla 5 before destiny could further his criminal ends the league discovered his treachery as green arrow had heard from an underworld informant that a member of the league had been captured and was being impersonated the league was captured by his will deadening beam which also had kryptonite as an element destiny then revealed he planned to send his ship into space thus getting rid of the jla however when drawing the jla upwards the station suffered a brief power drain lessening the effects of the will deadener green lantern was able to free himself during the drain and promptly imprisoned destiny and his two henchmen morpheus edit he then created the materioptikon a device which allowed him to create reality from the fabric of dreams 6 in a later retcon in the sandman series written by neil gaiman his mother ethel the former mistress of roderick burgess gave morpheus dreamstone to him which powered the device he manipulated the dreamstone forcing flaws and adding circuitry until it was attuned to him and not the dream king morpheus was imprisoned by alex burgess at the time unaware of what destiny was doing and unable to stop or prevent it 4 doctor destiny s power was so great that the justice league resorted to drastic measures to stop him they hypnotized him and manipulated his psyche to prevent him from dreaming this kept him from using the materioptikon for criminal purposes but caused him to lose his mind and shrivel to a skeletal wreck of a man he was then sent to arkham asylum where his sanity eroded further 4 he escaped from arkham and captured the sandman dr garrett sanford and used equipment to pit people s dreams against the justice league eventually capturing most of the current leaguers thanks to the efforts of others such as zatanna and elongated man the sandman was freed and reclaimed his equipment aiding doctor destiny s recapture 7 arkham asylum edit again from the sandman series by neil gaiman when his mother died doctor destiny escaped arkham reclaimed the ruby which he used to go on a rampage driving the whole world insane destiny makes his way to a 24 hour diner and proceeds to torture the patrons in numerous sadistic ways over the span of 24 hours before having them kill each other dream recently freed and searching for stolen tokens of power could not stop destiny until the villain decided to leech all of dream s power into the ruby and destroy the gem the destruction of the dreamstone returned all of its power back to dream including power the lord of dreams had been without for millennia morpheus then returned destiny to arkham and returned the ability to dream or at least sleep although he is able to dream once again destiny s sanity is still extremely shaky doctor destiny later learned that continued use of the materioptikon meant he still had some dream manipulation powers even without the dreamstone he warped the atom s dreams of the original justice league into a world where the superheroes were fascist bullies as part of a plan to trap the then current justice league there he was defeated when the comatose blue beetle was able to enter the dream world later doctor destiny threatened the jla once again by bringing his dream self into the real world and attacking them with bizarre and irrational dream logic haunting scenes of his old crimes as well as atlantis the ocean signifying a spiritual centre in dreams before destiny s dream self fully realized what was happening to him he was defeated when the league tracked down his real world self and projected their dream selves into reality to confront destiny since the league were dreaming about victory they couldn t lose and destiny was swiftly returned to his cell in arkham over the years doctor destiny has proven one of the justice league s most persistent foes 4 in his earliest appearances before he lost his sanity his goals were more rational to acquire wealth and personal power to eliminate all his enemies and so on all of these schemes revolved around the creative and liberal use of the materioptikon a strategy which often caught his opponents off guard one can assume that destiny is still interested in attaining all of his former goals the elimination of the justice league the restoration of his human appearance and the reconstruction of the materioptikon 4th parallel edit during the 4th parallel storyline in jla classified doctor destiny s control over the materioptikon is usurped by darrin profitt the red king justice society of america edit in the previews for future issues of justice society of america vol 3 starman mentioned it s the doctor the one with no face which would allude to future appearances by

uses dream girl s nightmares to deal with the asylum guards when batman sandman starman and geo force arrive at the asylum starman goes up against destiny by himself but is subdued when destiny uses dream girl s powers to create a zombified version of kenz nuhor the man starman killed starman begs destiny to let dream girl go and awakens her from her trance by using the wake up word when she awakens dream girl tells destiny that she foresaw his death being killed in his sleep by the owner of the dreamstone before she knocks him out superman batman edit in the superman batman storyline mash up doctor destiny created a dream world consisting of combinations of people from the real world hoping to replace the waking world with his fabricated realm superman and batman who had managed to escape being fused together stopped destiny by freeing the combined form of raven and zatanna the backlash from the broken illusion put destiny into a comatose state mumbling the name bruce kent the only combined being he was unable to create he appears again capable of massive reality warping without direct control of the materioptikon in the waking world or at least enough magical power to

battle a radioactive meteorite crashes nearby exposure to it makes vandar immortal and invulnerable to injury while evolving his mind after vandar leaves klarn frees a glowing jewel from the meteorite and fashions it into an amulet his mind also evolves and he later realizes he now has a unique form of reincarnation 12 throughout history he fights to protect people from threats and repeatedly interferes with the schemes of vandar adg who adopts the name vandal savage by the 1980s the immortal man is living in the body of a middle aged man of apparent european descent and has amassed great wealth and high tech resources realizing vandal savage has a means to corrupt superman the immortal man attempts to contact the justice league but the team is away on a mission rather than wait he decides to deal with savage s scheme and the mystery behind several strange golden pyramids by creating a team of forgotten heroes recruiting retired and semi retired adventurers including the sea devils cave carson animal man congo bill the time traveler rip hunter dolphin and rick flag of the suicide squad in the end the heroes are triumphant and superman recovers 12 months after this adventure superman and the immortal man s forgotten heroes fight and defeat vandal savage s new team of forgotten villains although the heroes win the immortal man is killed while saving dolphin from an attack by the faceless hunter from saturn once the battle is finished the immortal man appears again now as a young man who appears to be of asian heritage 13 during these 1980s stories the immortal man s other powers do not play a major role in the 1985 1986 crossover crisis on infinite earths the multiverse is threatened and all reality is in peril during the final battles immortal man sacrifices his immortal energies to help save the world and is seemingly unable to return 14 post crisis edit some time after the immortal man s sacrifice during crisis on infinite earths an adolescent girl named steffi jones suddenly gains the immortal man s memories as well as the power of flight she helps the flash against vandal savage and the speedster hero asks if she is the immortal man in a new body steffi says she doesn t think so while she has immortal man s memories and instincts but not his amulet she believes she is a new person and refers to herself as the immortal one no mention is made of stefi s parents or if she was a child found and adopted so it is also unclear if she was already alive before the crisis in which case she could not be immortal man after savage s plan is defeated steffi confronts him and the two are caught in an explosion that seemingly destroys them 15 savage later turns up alive and continues battling earth s superheroes steffi jones is never seen again making it unclear if she died in the blast or was reborn in a new body afterward or was indeed the original immortal man after all in the 1990s the comic series resurrection man reveals that the meteorite that empowered vandar adg and klarn carried tektites a form of nanite based technology these tektites infected the two men to different degrees granting them their unique abilities with immortal man s amulet apparently maintaining his tektite field the meteorite was hurled through time by unknown agents landing in what would become the ardennes forest 1 93 million years ago during the pleistocene era 16 17 in the late 20th century the amnesiac hero mitch shelley begins operating as the resurrection man like immortal man and vandal savage he has tektites in his body that grant him a form of immortality every time he is killed he returns moments or minutes later fully healed and with a different superhuman power the forgotten heroes encounter mitch shelley and believe he may be the immortal man with altered powers trying to jog his memory they talk about an adventure they shared with immortal man soon before the crisis during which the hero had the form of a middle aged man with black hair and white temples encountering vandal savage the villain admits he has fought mitch shelley many times over throughout history but reveals the resurrection man is an entirely separate person from the immortal man to prove it he reveals the real immortal man has been his prisoner since soon after the crisis the immortal man still has the appearance he had before the crisis indicating he did not reincarnate as steffi jones afterward 18 resurrection man vandal savage and the immortal man then join forces against a creature that emerges along with a second tektite meteorite this creature a warp child alters time and erases many of the world s heroes from reality the immortal man melds his tektite field with the creature s own overloading it and destroying them both while restoring history in the process because he overloaded his tektites the source of his immortality it is implied the immortal man is now truly dead 19 dc rebirth edit following the dc rebirth relaunch of dc comics in 2016 a new version of immortal man is introduced in the series immortal men in the new history klarn arg is born in the 47th century bce a member of the bear clan with siblings one night a radioactive meteorite strikes earth and the four siblings investigate alongside vandar adg and the wolf clan the five primitive humans are bathed in strange radiation that evolves their minds and makes them immortal the five form a council of immortals and decide to help humanity but debate the best method to do so three methods debated are through knowledge through harmony or through expression klarn who eventually takes the name immortal man believes in saving humanity through action specifically the action of good people striving to save others his sister kyra who adopts the name infinite woman argues humanity rises best through conquest or when forced to face an enemy 20 over time the council of immortals immortal man infinite woman constant forever child and vandal savage gain many followers forming five different houses the five immortals find they can also share some immortality but not invulnerability with those they choose allowing some followers to remain with them for centuries the immortal man is leader of the house of action based in a place called the campus and his followers sometimes refer to themselves as the immortal men infinite woman leads the house of conquest based in a place called the siege other houses include the house of knowledge the codex the house of expression the masque and the house of harmony the tabernacle each house influences humanity and agrees through official treaties not to interfere with each other the immortal houses use different methods to block the memories of mortals who see them and learn of their secret operations the houses refer to their secret operations and battles as the eternal war to save humanity the house of conquest and house of action often clash 20 in the 21st century the house of conquest breaks the immortal treaties by attacking the house of action the immortal man fearing his sister will succeed in killing him initially plans to transmit his mind into a new recruit a teenage boy named caden park who has the ability to read another s memories mind swipes the plan fails and immortal man seemingly dies caden gains a blood mask device that the immortal man had developed before his death and the computer mistakenly believes the teenager to be the immortal man reborn with this caden can access klarn s database and the memories of his dead followers in retaliation for the house of conquest s actions and to prevent them from achieving victory the immortal men disables the technology keeping their battle unseen forcing the world and the justice league to see evidence of the eternal war 20 other versions edit in final crisis superman beyond 1 superman moves briefly through earth 20 a world protected by the society of super heroes led by doc fate an alternate version of doctor fate and including a version of immortal man 21 writer grant morrison described this particular parallel earth as having the style of a 1940s retro thing explaining why doc fate the immortal man and their allies are drawn in the style of 1930s and 40s pulp magazine heroes 22 in the multiversity the society of super heroes conquerors from the counter world 1 2014 it is revealed that this version of immortal man is actually anthro who in dc comics is often cited to be one of earth s first homo sapiens on earth 20 anthro was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed vandal savage s immortality he and doc fate s society of super heroes are earth 20 s last defense against an invasion by earth 40 an evil counterpart to earth 20 where vandal savage and lady shiva lead an army of villains powers and abilities edit original version edit due to exposure to a unique meteorite first said to be radioactive later revised to be empowered by microscopic technology called tektites klarn the immortal man possesses a reincarnation ability if he dies he soon materializes in a new body elsewhere on earth appearing from nowhere without having to be literally born again as is usually the case with traditional reincarnation each time klarn materializes in a new form an amulet he made from the meteorite materializes with him at the beginning of a new life the immortal man s mind is sometimes clouded and his memories hazy but the amulet quickly works to restore his memories the amulet regulates klarn s mind and reincarnation power by stabilizing his tektite field due to his many lives across thousands of years the immortal man is an excellent tactician skilled in various forms of combat and survival and is knowledgeable in many fields of study his different bodies vary in age appearance and athletic prowess but the immortal man s basic personality remains the same if the immortal man is separated from his amulet then he has greater difficulty recalling the knowledge and skills he s acquired through his lives in his four original 1960s stories the immortal man s amulet also grants him psionic abilities such as pyrokinesis creating and controlling nearby flame limited telepathy allowing animal communication and control over weaker willed minds and limited telekinesis allowing flight and reinforcing his physical strength none of these powers appear again after his reintroduction in 1984 though steffi jones who either inherits his power or is the immortal man in a new form is seen to possess the power of flight during the series resurrection man it was said the immortal man vandal savage and mitch shelley could all sense each other s presence due to their tektites reacting to each other dc rebirth version edit since dc rebirth klarn does not reincarnate into new bodies instead an encounter with a strange meteorite leaves him ageless and invulnerable to harm in this continuity klarn can also share immortality but not his invulnerability meaning those he bestows with power are untouched by age or disease the traditional definition of immortality but can still be killed by physical injury and other outside factors caden park the new immortal man after klarn possesses telepathy while wearing the device known as blood mask caden can access the skills and memories of all fallen immortal men of the house of action in other media edit in the shared arrowverse of the cw network s dctv shows elements of immortal man s story are given to hawkman and hawkgirl as well as rip hunter all of whom are sworn enemies of vandal savage in this version of events references edit cowsill alan irvine alex korte steve manning matt wiacek win wilson sven 2016 the dc comics encyclopedia the definitive

character in dc comics he first appeared in justice league of america 100 101 1972 originally a villain responsible for the disappearance of the seven soldiers of victory he has since reappeared as neh buh loh the primary antagonist in the 2005 2006 mega series seven soldiers by grant morrison before this reappearance morrison built up the character s backstory starting in 1997 with more extensive appearances in jla classified 2005 contents 1 fictional character biography 2 allusions 3 other versions 4 references 5 external links fictional character biography edit the neh buh loh is in fact the adult version of a sentient universe called qwewq he first appeared as the nebula man in justice league of america 100 1 described as a cosmic being whose touch has the power of 20 atomic bombs he was supposedly created by a villain known as the hand to defeat the original seven soldiers of victory a later retcon would give him his current origin with the hand s involvement being more incidental he battled the soldiers in tibet his actions scattered the soldiers through time a fate from which they were later saved by the justice league and justice society the nebula man was defeated when the sidekick of the crimson avenger wing sacrificed himself to deliver the final blow with a cosmic device wing was buried in tibet by monks who witnessed his death during the jla storyline rock of ages the flash aquaman and green lantern are sent by metron through time and space and they land on wonderworld during a brief tour of wonderworld s omnitropolis and its museum district by that world s atom analogue mote a few peculiar items are mentioned amongst them are an evil 5 dimensional imp trapped in a 6 dimensional bottle a speedster glimmer s treadmill and a larval universe they call qwewq they say that they are feeding it and hope to allow it to grow to its full potential 2 the nebula man appeared once more in stars and s t r i p e 3 before reappearing in jla classified 1 3 working with gorilla grodd and announcing the end of the world at the same time the justice league were in the infant universe of qwewq unaware that this was neh buh loh s larval form 4 in the seven soldiers series neh buh loh was revealed to be allied with or perhaps created by the sheeda time travelling predators from the end of time he served as the personal huntsman of the sheeda queen gloriana tenebrae in the past neh buh loh had been sent to slay the queen s innocent stepdaughter rhiannon a k a misty kilgore however moved by her beauty and symmetry he could not bear to do it and allowed the girl to escape this was neh buh loh s secret shame for many years it was further explained that in the 1940s neh buh loh had been summoned rather than created by the hand using a sonic horn the creature was seeking seven soldiers who were prophesied to one day defeat his mistress gloriana the hand was all too eager to point him in the right direction thus leading to the original seven soldiers becoming lost in time this same sonic horn was used by the hand s nephew boy blue to once again summon neh buh loh and the sheeda in the present leading to the destruction of an ad hoc seven soldiers team created by the original vigilante this set the stage for the harrowing of earth which the heroes of the seven soldiers series attempted to prevent neh buh loh was finally defeated by frankenstein who capitalized on a flaw placed in him as an infant by the ultramarine corps a team of heroes who had entered qwewq seeking redemption 5 allusions edit the use of neh buh loh in seven soldiers is influenced by several characters in myth and legend his failed mission to kill his queen s lovely stepdaughter 6 is a direct parallel with the fairy tale of snow white in addition his role as the horned huntsman of the sheeda has elements of characters from celtic mythology such as the horned god cernunnos and later legends such as the king of the wild hunt and herne the hunter other

the citizen s patrol corps a police force that kept the peace in kandor under the kryptonian banner of el their creator 21 due to the compression of time more than a century had passed inside the bottle city compared to only a handful of years outside it during which preus and his fellow kandorians had come to worship the superman as their god in heaven above the corpsman was also a devout xenophobe who dispensed justice against non k kryptonian dissidents that threatened their way of life especially a citizen named kal el who forever tainted paradise when he seemingly murdered several kandorians 22 preus swore a solemn oath to make the murderer pay not realizing that kal el was actually the superman that he and the others had worshiped for so long 23 he was also unaware that the victims were constructs created by an alien telepath lyla who had brainwashed kal el into believing that kandor was a never exploded krypton 24 eventually shattering the illusion superman escaped kandor and confronted lyla back in metropolis preus followed them but exposure to earth s air and yellow sun drastically affected him giving him strange new powers equal to superman s while amplifying his already unbalanced racist views 25 convinced that kal el had defiled the legacy of the superman preus swore to assume that responsibility himself and that all of the impure would die by his hand his xenophobia led him to a group of white supremacists in the american desert who he forced into worshiping him and his views however in time the people of god s peake as the camp was called came to worship preus as their cult leader his increasing prominence eventually led both the martian manhunter and jimmy olsen to investigate only to have both of them captured by preus and his men 26 this forced a confrontation with superman who at the time was dealing with the effects of gog s synthetic yellow kryptonite which had significantly aged and weakened superman in a short period of time so weakened superman was barely able to deal with preus legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the at the time much more vital preus 27 a last ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken preus failed as preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite he was finally defeated when superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of preus armor rendering him unconscious afterwards preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized his current whereabouts are unknown he was last seen as a weakened superman tried to fly him to s t a r labs for treatment

neutrons an atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element 1 every solid liquid gas and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms atoms are extremely small typically around 100 picometers across they are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics as if they were tennis balls for example is not possible due to quantum effects every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus the nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons more than 99 94 of an atom s mass is in the nucleus the protons have a positive electric charge the electrons have a negative electric charge and the neutrons have no electric charge if the number of protons and electrons are equal then the atom is electrically neutral if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons then it has an overall negative or positive charge respectively such atoms are called ions the electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force this force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force in this case the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements this is a form of nuclear decay the number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number and it defines to which chemical element the atom belongs for example any atom that contains 29 protons is copper the number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element for example a copper atom with 34 neutrons is copper 63 29 34 and with 36 neutrons is copper 65 natural copper is about 70 cu 63 and the rest is cu 65 atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals for example new york city s statue of liberty was originally made of pure copper but over the years the surface combined with oxygen carbon and sulfur atoms to make a green patina on the copper the ability of atoms to attach and detach is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature chemistry is the discipline that studies these

reading 11 external links history of atomic theory main article atomic theory in philosophy main article atomism the basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is an old idea that appeared in many ancient cultures such as those of greece and india the word atom is derived from the ancient greek word atomos a which means uncuttable this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts 2 3 in the early 19th century the scientist john dalton noticed that chemical elements seemed to combine with each other by basic units of weight and he decided to use the word atom to refer to these units on the assumption that these were the fundamental particles of matter about a century later it was discovered that dalton s atoms are not actually indivisible but the term stuck dalton s law of multiple proportions atoms and molecules as depicted in john dalton s a new system of chemical philosophy vol 1 1808 in the early 1800s the english chemist john dalton compiled experimental data gathered by himself and other scientists and discovered a pattern now known as the law of multiple proportions he noticed that in chemical compounds which contain a particular chemical element the content of that element in these compounds will differ in weight by ratios of small whole numbers this pattern suggested to dalton that each chemical element combines with other elements by a basic and consistent unit of weight and he decided to call these units atoms for example there are two types of tin oxide one is a black powder that is 88 1 tin and 11 9 oxygen and the other is a white powder that is 78 7 tin and 21 3 oxygen adjusting these figures in the black oxide there is about 13 5 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin and in the white oxide there is about 27 g of oxygen for every 100 g of tin 13 5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 2 dalton concluded that in these oxides for every tin atom there are one or two oxygen atoms respectively sno and sno2 4 5 dalton also analyzed iron oxides there is one type of iron oxide that is a black powder which is 78 1 iron and 21 9 oxygen and there is another iron oxide that is a red powder which is 70 4 iron and 29 6 oxygen adjusting these figures in the black oxide there is about 28 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron and in the red oxide there is about 42 g of oxygen for every 100 g of iron 28 and 42 form a ratio of 2 3 in these respective oxides for every two atoms of iron there are two or three atoms of oxygen fe2o2 and fe2o3 b 6 7 as a final example nitrous oxide is 63 3 nitrogen and 36 7 oxygen nitric oxide is 44 05 nitrogen and 55 95 oxygen and nitrogen dioxide is 29 5 nitrogen and 70 5 oxygen adjusting these figures in nitrous oxide there is 80 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen in nitric oxide there is about 160 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen and in nitrogen dioxide there is 320 g of oxygen for every 140 g of nitrogen 80 160 and 320 form a ratio of 1 2 4 the respective formulas for these oxides are n2o no and no2 8 9 kinetic theory of gases main article kinetic theory of gases in 1738 daniel bernoulli 10 and a number of other scientists found that they could better explain the behavior of gases by describing them as collections of sub microscopic particles and modelling their behavior using statistics and probability unlike dalton s atomic theory the kinetic theory of gases describes not how gases react chemically with each other to form compounds but how they behave physically diffusion viscosity conductivity pressure etc brownian motion in 1827 botanist robert brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically a phenomenon that became known as brownian motion this was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about in 1905 albert einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first statistical physics analysis of brownian motion 11 12 13 french physicist jean perrin used einstein s work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of molecules thereby providing physical evidence for the particle nature of matter 14 discovery of the electron the geiger marsden experiment left expected results alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection right observed results a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus in 1897 j j thomson discovered that cathode rays are not electromagnetic waves but made of particles that are 1 800 times lighter than hydrogen the lightest atom thomson concluded that these particles came from the atoms within the cathode they were subatomic particles he called these new particles corpuscles but they were later renamed electrons thomson also showed that electrons were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials 15 it was quickly recognized that electrons are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires 16 thomson concluded that these electrons emerged from the very atoms of the cathode in his instruments which meant that atoms are not indivisible as the name atomos suggests discovery of the nucleus main article geiger marsden experiment j j thomson thought that the negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a sea of positive charge that was distributed across the whole volume of the atom 17 this model is sometimes known as the plum pudding model ernest rutherford and his colleagues hans geiger and ernest marsden came to have doubts about the thomson model after they encountered difficulties when they tried to build an instrument to measure the charge to mass ratio of alpha particles these are positively charged particles emitted by certain radioactive substances such as radium the alpha particles were being scattered by the air in the detection chamber which made the measurements unreliable thomson had encountered a similar problem in his work on cathode rays which he solved by creating a near perfect vacuum in his instruments rutherford didn t think he d run into this same problem because alpha particles are much heavier than electrons according to thomson s model of the atom the positive charge in the atom is not concentrated enough to produce an electric field strong enough to deflect an alpha particle and the electrons are so lightweight they should be pushed aside effortlessly by the much heavier alpha particles yet there was scattering so rutherford and his colleagues decided to investigate this scattering carefully 18 between 1908 and 1913 rutherford and his colleagues performed a series of experiments in which they bombarded thin foils of metal with alpha particles they spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90 to explain this rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is not distributed throughout the atom s volume as thomson believed but is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center only such an intense concentration of charge could produce an electric field strong enough to deflect the alpha particles as observed 18 discovery of isotopes while experimenting with the products of radioactive decay in 1913 radiochemist frederick soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table 19 the term isotope was coined by margaret todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element j j thomson created a technique for isotope separation through his work on ionized gases which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes 20 bohr model the bohr model of the atom with an electron making instantaneous quantum leaps from one orbit to another with gain or loss of energy this model of electrons in orbits is obsolete main article bohr model in 1913 the physicist niels bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon 21 this quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable given that normally charges in acceleration including circular motion lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation see synchrotron radiation and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra 22 later in the same year henry moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of niels bohr s theory these results refined ernest rutherford s and antonius van den broek s model which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its atomic number in the periodic table until these experiments atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity that it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today 23 chemical bonds between atoms were explained by gilbert newton lewis in 1916 as the interactions between their constituent electrons 24 as the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law 25 in 1919 the american chemist irving langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus 26 the bohr model of the atom was the first complete physical model of the atom it described the overall structure of the atom how atoms bond to each other and predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen bohr s model was not perfect and was soon superseded by the more accurate schrödinger model but it was sufficient to evaporate any remaining doubts that matter is composed of atoms for chemists the idea of the atom had been a useful heuristic tool but physicists had doubts as to whether matter really is made up of atoms as nobody had yet developed a complete physical model of the atom the schrödinger model the stern gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of atomic properties when a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field the beam was split in a way correlated with the direction of an atom s angular momentum or spin as this spin direction is initially random the beam would be expected to deflect in a random direction instead the beam was split into two directional components corresponding to the atomic spin being oriented up or down with respect to the magnetic field 27 in 1925 werner heisenberg published the first consistent mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics matrix mechanics 23 one year earlier louis de broglie had proposed the de broglie hypothesis that all particles behave like waves to some extent 28 and in 1926 erwin schrödinger used this idea to develop the schrödinger equation a mathematical model of the atom wave mechanics that described the electrons as three dimensional waveforms rather than point particles 29 a consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time this became known as the uncertainty principle formulated by werner heisenberg in 1927 23 in this concept for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum and vice versa 30 this model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen thus the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed 31 32 discovery of the neutron the development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy the device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom s mass to its charge the chemist francis william aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses the atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts called the whole number rule 33 the explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton by the physicist james chadwick in 1932 isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus 34 fission high energy physics and condensed matter in 1938 the german chemist otto hahn a student of rutherford directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements instead his chemical experiments showed barium as a product 35 36 a year later lise meitner and her nephew otto frisch verified that hahn s result were the first experimental nuclear fission 37 38 in 1944 hahn received the nobel prize in chemistry despite hahn s efforts the contributions of meitner and frisch were not recognized 39 in the 1950s the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies 40 neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons or composites of smaller particles called quarks the standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions 41 structure subatomic particles main article subatomic particle though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles the constituent particles of an atom are the electron the proton and the neutron the electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 9 11 10 31 kg with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques 42 it was the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured until the discovery of neutrino mass under ordinary conditions electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges if an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole a charged atom is called an ion electrons have been known since the late 19th century mostly thanks to j j thomson see history of subatomic physics for details protons have a positive charge and a mass 1 836 times that of the electron at 1 6726 10 27 kg the number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number ernest rutherford 1919 observed that nitrogen under alpha particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei by 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1 839 times the mass of the electron or 1 6749 10 27 kg 43 44 neutrons are the heaviest of the three constituent particles but their mass can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy neutrons and protons collectively known as nucleons have comparable dimensions on the order of 2 5 10 15 m although the surface of these particles is not sharply defined 45 the neutron was discovered in 1932 by the english physicist james chadwick in the standard model of physics electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure whereas protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks there are two types of quarks in atoms each having a fractional electric charge protons are composed of two up quarks each with charge 2 3 and one down quark with a charge of 1 3 neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks this distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles 46 47 the quarks are held together by the strong interaction or strong force which is mediated by gluons the protons and neutrons in turn are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range properties see the article on the nuclear force for more the gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces 46 47 nucleus main article atomic nucleus the binding energy needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus for various isotopes all the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus and are collectively called nucleons the radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1 07 a 3 displaystyle 1 07 sqrt 3 a femtometres where a displaystyle a is the total number of nucleons 48 this is much smaller than the radius of the atom which is on the order of 105 fm the nucleons are bound together by a short ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force at distances smaller than 2 5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other 49 atoms of the same element have the same number of protons called the atomic number within a single element the number of neutrons may vary determining the isotope of that element the total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide the number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay 50 the proton the electron and the neutron are classified as fermions fermions obey the pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions such as multiple protons from occupying the same quantum state at the same time thus every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud 51 a nucleus that has a different number of protons than neutrons can potentially drop to a lower energy state through a radioactive decay that causes the number of protons and neutrons to more closely match as a result atoms with matching numbers of protons and neutrons are more stable against decay but with increasing atomic number the mutual repulsion of the protons requires an increasing proportion of neutrons to maintain the stability of the nucleus 51 illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus consisting of a proton and a neutron from two protons a positron e an antimatter electron is emitted along with an electron neutrino the number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified although this can require very high energies because of the strong force nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei for example at the core of the sun protons require energies of 3 to 10 kev to overcome their mutual repulsion the coulomb barrier and fuse together into a single nucleus 52 nuclear fission is the opposite process causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei usually through radioactive decay the nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons if this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus the atom changes to a different chemical element 53 54 if the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy such as a gamma ray or the kinetic energy of a beta particle as described by albert einstein s mass energy equivalence formula e m c 2 displaystyle e mc 2 where m displaystyle m is the mass loss and c displaystyle c is the speed of light this deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus and it is the non recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate 55 the fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel a total nucleon number of about 60 is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together 56 it is this energy releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self sustaining reaction for heavier nuclei the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease that means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26 and atomic masses higher than about 60 is an endothermic process these more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star 51 electron cloud main articles electron configuration electron shell and atomic orbital a potential well showing according to classical mechanics the minimum energy v x needed to reach each position x classically a particle with energy e is constrained to a range of positions between x1 and x2 the electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force this force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape the closer an electron is to the nucleus the greater the attractive force hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations electrons like other particles have properties of both a particle and a wave the electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three dimensional standing wave a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus this behavior is defined by an atomic orbital a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured 57 only a discrete or quantized set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form 58 orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures and differ from each other in size shape and orientation 59 3d views of some hydrogen like atomic orbitals showing probability density and phase g orbitals and higher are not shown each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron the electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state likewise through spontaneous emission an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon these characteristic energy values defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states are responsible for atomic spectral lines 58 the amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron the electron binding energy is far less than the binding energy of nucleons for example it requires only 13 6 ev to strip a ground state electron from a hydrogen atom 60 compared to 2 23 million ev for splitting a deuterium nucleus 61 atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms by this mechanism atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals 62 properties nuclear properties main articles isotope stable isotope list of nuclides and list of elements by stability of isotopes by definition any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their nuclei belong to the same chemical element atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element for example all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton but isotopes exist with no neutrons hydrogen 1 by far the most common form 63 also called protium one neutron deuterium two neutrons tritium and more than two neutrons the known elements form a set of atomic numbers from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118 proton element oganesson 64 all known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive although the radioactivity of element 83 bismuth is so slight as to be practically negligible 65 66 about 339 nuclides occur naturally on earth 67 of which 252 about 74 have not been observed to decay and are referred to as stable isotopes only 90 nuclides are stable theoretically while another 162 bringing the total to 252 have not been observed to decay even though in theory it is energetically possible these are also formally classified as stable an additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half lives longer than 100 million years and are long lived enough to have been present since the birth of the solar system this collection of 286 nuclides are known as primordial nuclides finally an additional 53 short lived nuclides are known to occur naturally as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay such as radium from uranium or as products of natural energetic processes on earth such as cosmic ray bombardment for example carbon 14 68 note 1 for 80 of the chemical elements at least one stable isotope exists as a rule there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements the average being 3 2 stable isotopes per element twenty six elements have only a single stable isotope while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten for the element tin elements 43 61 and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes 69 1 12 stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons and also by the presence of certain magic numbers of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells these quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus filled shells such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin confers unusual stability on the nuclide of the 252 known stable nuclides only four have both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons hydrogen 2 deuterium lithium 6 boron 10 and nitrogen 14 also only four naturally occurring radioactive odd odd nuclides have a half life over a billion years potassium 40 vanadium 50 lanthanum 138 and tantalum 180m most odd odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are even even and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects 70 mass main articles atomic mass and mass number the large majority of an atom s mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up the total number of these particles called nucleons in a given atom is called the mass number it is a positive integer and dimensionless instead of having dimension of mass because it expresses a count an example of use of a mass number is carbon 12 which has 12 nucleons six protons and six neutrons the actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed in daltons da also called the unified atomic mass unit u this unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon 12 which is approximately 1 66 10 27 kg 71 hydrogen 1 the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass has an atomic weight of 1 007825 da 72 the value of this number is called the atomic mass a given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal within 1 to its mass number times the atomic mass unit for example the mass of a nitrogen 14 is roughly 14 da but this number will not be exactly an integer except by definition in the case of carbon 12 73 the heaviest stable atom is lead 208 65 with a mass of 207 9766521 da 74 as even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly chemists instead use the unit of moles one mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms about 6 022 1023 this number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram because of the definition of the unified atomic mass unit each carbon 12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12 da and so a mole of carbon 12 atoms weighs exactly 0 012 kg 71 shape and size main article atomic radius atoms lack a well defined outer boundary so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an atomic radius this is a measure of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus 75 this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond the radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart the type of chemical bond the number of neighboring atoms coordination number and a quantum mechanical property known as spin 76 on the periodic table of the elements atom size tends to increase when moving down columns but decrease when moving across rows left to right 77 consequently the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm while one of the largest is caesium at 225 pm 78 when subjected to external forces like electrical fields the shape of an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry the deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons as shown by group theoretical considerations aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals where large crystal electrical fields may occur at low symmetry lattice sites 79 80 significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to occur for sulfur ions 81 and chalcogen ions 82 in pyrite type compounds atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of light 400 700 nm so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope although individual atoms can be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope to visualize the minuteness of the atom consider that a typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width 83 a single drop of water contains about 2 sextillion 2 1021 atoms of oxygen and twice the number of hydrogen atoms 84 a single carat diamond with a mass of 2 10 4 kg contains about 10 sextillion 1022 atoms of carbon note 2 if an apple were magnified to the size of the earth then the atoms in the apple would be approximately the size of the original apple 85 radioactive decay main article radioactive decay this diagram shows the half life t1 2 of various isotopes with z protons and n neutrons every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are subject to radioactive decay causing the nucleus to emit particles or electromagnetic radiation radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force which only acts over distances on the order of 1 fm 86 the most common forms of radioactive decay are 87 88 alpha decay this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons the result of the emission is a new element with a lower atomic number beta decay and electron capture these processes are regulated by the weak force and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton or a proton into a neutron the neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino while proton to neutron transition except in electron capture causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino the electron or positron emissions are called beta particles beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one electron capture is more common than positron emission because it requires less energy in this type of decay an electron is absorbed by the nucleus rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus a neutrino is still emitted in this process and a proton changes to a neutron gamma decay this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation the excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle thus gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus or more than one beta particle an analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way is internal conversion a process that produces high speed electrons that are not beta rays followed by production of high energy photons that are not gamma rays a few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period the half life that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay this is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50 every half life hence after two half lives have passed only 25 of the isotope is present and so forth 86 magnetic moment main articles electron magnetic moment and nuclear magnetic moment elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as spin this is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point like and cannot be said to be rotating spin is measured in units of the reduced planck constant ħ with electrons protons and neutrons all having spin 1 2 ħ or spin 1 2 in an atom electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin 89 the magnetic field produced by an atom its magnetic moment is determined by these various forms of angular momentum just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field but the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin due to the nature of electrons to obey the pauli exclusion principle in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state bound electrons pair up with each other with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite spin down state thus these spins cancel each other out reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons 90 in ferromagnetic elements such as iron cobalt and nickel an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment the orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction when the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field 90 91 the nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons but for other cases of odd numbers the nucleus may have a spin normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium but for certain elements such as xenon 129 it is possible to polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction a condition called hyperpolarization this has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging 92 93 energy levels these electron s energy levels not to scale are sufficient for ground states of atoms up to cadmium 5s2 4d10 inclusively do not forget that even the top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state the potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative relative to when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity its dependence on the electron s position reaches the minimum inside the nucleus roughly in inverse proportion to the distance in the quantum mechanical model a bound electron can occupy only a set of states centered on the nucleus and each state corresponds to a specific energy level see time independent schrödinger equation for a theoretical explanation an energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom and is usually given in units of electronvolts ev the lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state i e stationary state while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state 94 the electron s energy increases along with n because the average distance to the nucleus increases dependence of the energy on ℓ is caused not by the electrostatic potential of the nucleus but by interaction between electrons for an electron to transition between two different states e g ground state to first excited state it must absorb or emit a photon at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels according to the niels bohr model what can be precisely calculated by the schrödinger equation electrons jump between orbitals in a particle like fashion for example if a single photon strikes the electrons only a single electron changes states in response to the photon see electron properties the energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum 95 each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge subshells filled by electrons the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors 96 an example of absorption lines in a spectrum when a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma some of the photons are absorbed by atoms causing electrons to change their energy level those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon traveling in a random direction and so drop back to lower energy levels thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output an observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined 97 close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting this occurs because of spin orbit coupling which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron 98 when an atom is in an external magnetic field spectral lines become split into three or more components a phenomenon called the zeeman effect this is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level which thus appear as a single spectral line the interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels resulting in multiple spectral lines 99 the presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels a phenomenon called the stark effect 100 if a bound electron is in an excited state an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level for this to occur the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon the emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases that is the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized this physical property is used to make lasers which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band 101 valence and bonding behavior main articles valence chemistry and chemical bond valency is the combining power of an element it is determined by the number of bonds it can form to other atoms or groups 102 the outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the valence shell and the electrons in that shell are called valence electrons the number of valence electrons determines the bonding behavior with other atoms atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a manner that fills or empties their outer valence shells 103 for example a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one electron more than a filled shell and others that are one electron short of a full shell such as occurs in the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic salts many elements display multiple valences or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds thus chemical bonding between these elements takes many forms of electron sharing that are more than simple electron transfers examples include the element carbon and the organic compounds 104 the chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table the horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons the elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons which results in chemically inert elements known as the noble gases 105 106 states main articles state of matter and phase matter graphic illustrating the formation of a bose einstein condensate quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions such as temperature and pressure by varying the conditions materials can transition between solids liquids gases and plasmas 107 within a state a material can also exist in different allotropes an example of this is solid carbon which can exist as graphite or diamond 108 gaseous allotropes exist as well such as dioxygen and ozone at temperatures close to absolute zero atoms can form a bose einstein condensate at which point quantum mechanical effects which are normally only observed at the atomic scale become apparent on a macroscopic scale 109 110 this super cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single super atom which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical behavior 111 identification scanning tunneling microscope image showing the individual atoms making up this gold 100 surface the surface atoms deviate from the bulk crystal structure and arrange in columns several atoms wide with pits between them see surface reconstruction while atoms are too small to be seen devices such as the scanning tunneling microscope stm enable their visualization at the surfaces of solids the microscope uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would be insurmountable in the classical perspective electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two biased electrodes providing a tunneling current that is exponentially dependent on their separation one electrode is a sharp tip ideally ending with a single atom at each point of the scan of the surface the tip s height is adjusted so as to keep the tunneling current at a set value how much the tip moves to and away from the surface is interpreted as the height profile for low bias the microscope images the averaged electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels the local density of the electronic states near the fermi level 112 113 because of the distances involved both electrodes need to be extremely stable only then periodicities can be observed that correspond to individual atoms the method alone is not chemically specific and cannot identify the atomic species present at the surface atoms can be easily identified by their mass if an atom is ionized by removing one of its electrons its trajectory when it passes through a magnetic field will bend the radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom the mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass to charge ratio of ions if a sample contains multiple isotopes the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis 114 the atom probe tomograph has sub nanometer resolution in 3 d and can chemically identify individual atoms using time of flight mass spectrometry 115 electron emission techniques such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and auger electron spectroscopy aes which measure the binding energies of the core electrons are used to identify the atomic species present in a sample in a non destructive way with proper focusing both can be made area specific another such method is electron energy loss spectroscopy eels which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron microscope when it interacts with a portion of a sample spectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of distant stars specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms these colors can be replicated using a gas discharge lamp containing the same element 116 helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the sun 23 years before it was found on earth 117 origin and current state baryonic matter forms about 4 of the total energy density of the observable universe with an average density of about 0 25 particles m3 mostly protons and electrons 118 within a galaxy such as the milky way particles have a much higher concentration with the density of matter in the interstellar medium ism ranging from 105 to 109 atoms m3 119 the sun is believed to be inside the local bubble so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about 103 atoms m3 120 stars form from dense clouds in the ism and the evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ism with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium up to 95 of the milky way s baryonic matter are concentrated inside stars where conditions are unfavorable for atomic matter the total baryonic mass is about 10 of the mass of the galaxy 121 the remainder of the mass is an unknown dark matter 122 high temperature inside stars makes most atoms fully ionized that is separates all electrons from the nuclei in stellar remnants with exception of their surface layers an immense pressure make electron shells impossible formation main article nucleosynthesis periodic table showing the origin of each element elements from carbon up to sulfur may be made in small stars by the alpha process elements beyond iron are made in large stars with slow neutron capture s process elements heavier than iron may be made in neutron star mergers or supernovae after the r process electrons are thought to exist in the universe since early stages of the big bang atomic nuclei forms in nucleosynthesis reactions in about three minutes big bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium lithium and deuterium in the universe and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron 123 124 125 ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their binding energy which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons where the temperature is much higher than ionization potential the matter exists in the form of plasma a gas of positively charged ions possibly bare nuclei and electrons when the temperature drops below the ionization potential atoms become statistically favorable atoms complete with bound electrons became to dominate over charged particles 380 000 years after the big bang an epoch called recombination when the expanding universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei 126 since the big bang which produced no carbon or heavier elements atomic nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to produce more of the element helium and via the triple alpha process the sequence of elements from carbon up to iron 127 see stellar nucleosynthesis for details isotopes such as lithium 6 as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through cosmic ray spallation 128 this occurs when a high energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected elements heavier than iron were produced in supernovae and colliding neutron stars through the r process and in agb stars through the s process both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei 129 elements such as lead formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements 130 earth most of the atoms that make up the earth and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the solar system the rest are the result of radioactive decay and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the earth through radiometric dating 131 132 most of the helium in the crust of the earth about 99 of the helium from gas wells as shown by its lower abundance of helium 3 is a product of alpha decay 133 there are a few trace atoms on earth that were not present at the beginning i e not primordial nor are results of radioactive decay carbon 14 is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere 134 some atoms on earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as by products of nuclear reactors or explosions 135 136 of the transuranic elements those with atomic numbers greater than 92 only plutonium and neptunium occur naturally on earth 137 138 transuranic elements have radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the earth 139 and thus identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed with the exception of traces of plutonium 244 possibly deposited by cosmic dust 131 natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by neutron capture in uranium ore 140 the earth contains approximately 1 33 1050 atoms 141 although small numbers of independent atoms of noble gases exist such as argon neon and helium 99 of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen at the surface of the earth an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds including water salt silicates and oxides atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules including crystals and liquid or solid metals 142 143 this atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter 144 rare and theoretical forms superheavy elements main article superheavy element all nuclides with atomic numbers higher than 82 lead are known to be radioactive no nuclide with an atomic number exceeding 92 uranium exists on earth as a primordial nuclide and heavier elements generally have shorter half lives nevertheless an island of stability encompassing relatively long lived isotopes of superheavy elements 145 with atomic numbers 110 to 114 might exist 146 predictions for the half life of the most stable nuclide on the island range from a few minutes to millions of years 147 in any case superheavy elements with z 104 would not exist due to increasing coulomb repulsion which results in spontaneous fission with increasingly short half lives in the absence of any stabilizing effects 148 exotic matter main article exotic matter each particle of matter has a corresponding antimatter particle with the opposite electrical charge thus the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton when a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet they annihilate each other because of this along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles the latter are rare in the universe the first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation as a result no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature 149 150 in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom antihydrogen was synthesized at the cern laboratory in geneva 151 152 other exotic atoms have been created by replacing one of the protons neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge for example an electron can be replaced by a more massive muon forming a muonic atom these types of atoms can be used to test fundamental predictions of physics 153 154 155 see also physics portal chemistry portal history of quantum mechanics infinite divisibility list of basic chemistry topics motion timeline of atomic and subatomic physics nuclear

tornado terms tropical cyclone terms weather portalvte lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during which two electrically charged regions both in the atmosphere or with one on the ground temporarily neutralize themselves causing the instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy 1 2 3 this discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic radiation from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons to brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black body radiation lightning causes thunder a sound from the shock wave which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure lightning occurs commonly during thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions the three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur either inside a single thundercloud intra cloud between two clouds cloud to cloud or between a cloud and the ground cloud to ground 4 5 many other observational variants are recognized including heat lightning which can be seen from a great distance but not heard dry lightning which can cause forest fires and ball lightning which is rarely observed scientifically humans have deified lightning for millennia idiomatic expressions derived from lightning such as the english expression bolt from the blue are common across languages at all times people have been fascinated by the sight and difference of lightning the fear of lightning is called astraphobia the first known photograph of lightning is from 1847 by thomas martin easterly 6 the first surviving photograph is from 1882 by william nicholson jennings 7 a photographer who spent half his life capturing pictures

upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from 15 to 25 c 5 to 13 f the details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification electrification can be by the triboelectric effect as a result of ion transfer between colliding bodies uncharged colliding water drops can become charged because of charge transfer between them as aqueous ions in an electric field as would exist in a thunder cloud 8 the main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly updraft and temperatures range from 15 to 25 c 5 to 13 f see figure 1 in that area the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super cooled cloud droplets small water droplets below freezing small ice crystals and graupel soft hail the updraft carries the super cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward at the same time the graupel which is considerably larger and denser tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air 9 figure 2 when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged the differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur when the rising ice crystals collide with graupel the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged see figure 2 the updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud the larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm 9 the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to the lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged the result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged 9 the upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals and positive charge in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from the thunderstorm cloud base this part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil while this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm updrafts and downdrafts in addition there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures 9 the induced separation of charge in pure liquid water has been known since the 1840s as has the electrification of pure liquid water by the tribo electric effect 10 william thomson lord kelvin demonstrated that charge separation in water occurs in the usual electric fields at the earth s surface and developed a continuous electric field measuring device using that knowledge 11 the physical separation of charge into different regions using liquid water was demonstrated by kelvin with the kelvin water dropper the most likely charge carrying species were considered to be the aqueous hydrogen ion and the aqueous hydroxide ion 12 the electrical charging of solid water ice has also been considered the charged species were again considered to be the hydrogen ion and the hydroxide ion 13 14 an electron is not stable in liquid water with respect to a hydroxide ion plus dissolved hydrogen for the time scales involved in thunder storms 15 the charge carrier in lightning is mainly electrons in a plasma 16 the process of going from charge as ions positive hydrogen ion and negative hydroxide ion associated with liquid water or solid water to charge as electrons associated with lightning must involve some form of electro chemistry that is the oxidation and or the reduction of chemical species 17 as hydroxide functions as a base and carbon dioxide is an acidic gas it is possible that charged water clouds in which the negative charge is in the form of the aqueous hydroxide ion interact with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form aqueous carbonate ions and aqueous hydrogen carbonate ions general considerations four second video of a lightning strike island in the sky canyonlands national park utah united states the typical cloud to ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting plasma channel through the air in excess of 5 km 3 1 mi tall from within the cloud to the ground s surface the actual discharge is the final stage of a very complex process 18 at its peak a typical thunderstorm produces three or more strikes to the earth per minute 19 lightning primarily occurs when warm air is mixed with colder air masses 20 resulting in atmospheric disturbances necessary for polarizing the atmosphere 21 however it can also occur during dust storms forest fires tornadoes volcanic eruptions and even in the cold of winter where the lightning is known as thundersnow 22 23 hurricanes typically generate some lightning mainly in the rainbands as much as 160 km 99 mi from the center 24 25 26 distribution frequency and extent main article distribution of lightning data from space based sensors reveal the uneven distribution of worldwide lightning strikes units flashes km2 yr data obtained from april 1995 to february 2003 from nasa s optical transient detector and from january 1998 to february 2003 from nasa s lightning imaging sensor lightning is not distributed evenly around earth as shown in the map on earth the lightning frequency is approximately 44 5 times per second or nearly 1 4 billion flashes per year 27 and the average duration is 0 2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes strokes of around 60 to 70 microseconds 28 many factors affect the frequency distribution strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world these factors include ground elevation latitude prevailing wind currents relative humidity and proximity to warm and cold bodies of water to a certain degree the proportions of intra cloud cloud to cloud and cloud to ground lightning may also vary by season in middle latitudes because human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the earth where lightning can damage or destroy them cloud to ground cg lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types even though in cloud ic and cloud to cloud cc are more common types of lightning lightning s relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation about 70 of lightning occurs over land in the tropics 29 where atmospheric convection is the greatest this occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder air masses as well as differences in moisture concentrations and it generally happens at the boundaries between them the flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses such as the gulf stream partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the southeast united states because large bodies of water lack the topographic variation that would result in atmospheric mixing lightning is notably less frequent over the world s oceans than over land the north and south poles are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least lightning clarification needed in general cg lightning flashes account for only 25 of all total lightning flashes worldwide since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged this is where most cg lightning originates this region is typically at the elevation where freezing occurs within the cloud freezing combined with collisions between ice and water appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process during wind driven collisions ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge while a heavier slushy mixture of ice and water called graupel develops a negative charge updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive space charge while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge lightning in belfort france because the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground the proportion of cg strikes versus cc or ic discharges becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground in the tropics where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere only 10 of lightning flashes are cg at the latitude of norway around 60 north latitude where the freezing elevation is lower 50 of lightning is cg 30 31 lightning is usually produced by cumulonimbus clouds which have bases that are typically 1 2 km 0 62 1 24 mi above the ground and tops up to 15 km 9 3 mi in height the place on earth where lightning occurs most often is near the small village of kifuka in the mountains of the eastern democratic republic of the congo 32 where the elevation is around 975 m 3 200 ft on average this region receives 158 lightning strikes per square kilometre per year 410 sq mi yr 33 lake maracaibo in venezuela averages 297 days per year with lightning activity an effect recognized as catatumbo lightning 34 other lightning hotspots include singapore 35 and lightning alley in central florida 36 37 the 477 mile megaflash from texas to louisiana 38 according to the united nations wmo on april 29 2020 a bolt 768 km 477 2 mi long was observed in the southern u s sixty km 37 mi longer than the previous distance record southern brazil october 31 2018 39 a single flash in uruguay and northern argentina on june 18 2020 lasted for 17 1 seconds 0 37 seconds longer than the previous record march 4 2019 also in northern argentina 39 necessary conditions main article thunderstorm sound of a thunderstorm in order for an electrostatic discharge to occur two preconditions are necessary first a sufficiently high potential difference between two regions of space must exist and second a high resistance medium must obstruct the free unimpeded equalization of the opposite charges the atmosphere provides the electrical insulation or barrier that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity it is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood 40 electrical field generation view of lightning from an airplane flying above a system as a thundercloud moves over the surface of the earth an equal electric charge but of opposite polarity is induced on the earth s surface underneath the cloud the induced positive surface charge when measured against a fixed point will be small as the thundercloud approaches increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes the referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve the oppositely charged regions create an electric field within the air between them this electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud the greater the accumulated charge the higher the electrical field flashes and strikes certain prominent structures often attract frequent lightning strikes the cn tower in toronto is struck many times every summer the best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground cg lightning although more common intra cloud ic and cloud to cloud cc flashes are very difficult to study given there are no physical points to monitor inside the clouds also given the very low probability of lightning striking the same point repeatedly and consistently scientific inquiry is difficult even in areas of high cg frequency a lightning strike from cloud to ground in the mojave desert california an intra cloud flash a lightning flash within the cloud illuminates the entire cloud lightning leaders a downward leader travels towards earth branching as it goes lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders positive shown in blue and negative in red in a process not well understood a bidirectional channel of ionized air called a leader is initiated between oppositely charged regions in a thundercloud leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through or are otherwise attracted to regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip the negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region also called a well inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well leaders often split forming branches in a tree like pattern 41 in addition negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion in a process called stepping the resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow motion videos of lightning flashes it is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely charged well entirely while the other end is still active when this happens the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud to air flash or a cloud to ground flash in a typical cloud to ground flash a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud the weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively charged ground the positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions positive upwards within the cloud and negative towards the earth both ionic channels proceed in their respective directions in a number of successive spurts each leader pools ions at the leading tips shooting out one or more new leaders momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions then shooting out another leader the negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward often speeding up as it gets closer to the earth s surface about 90 of ionic channel lengths between pools are approximately 45 m 148 ft in length 42 the establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time hundreds of milliseconds in comparison to the resulting discharge which occurs within a few dozen microseconds the electric current needed to establish the channel measured in the tens or hundreds of amperes is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge initiation of the lightning leader is not well understood the electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself 43 many hypotheses have been proposed one hypothesis postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by cosmic rays and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called runaway breakdown as these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules they initiate leader formation another hypothesis involves locally enhanced electric fields being formed near elongated water droplets or ice crystals 44 percolation theory especially for the case of biased percolation 45 clarification needed describes random connectivity phenomena which produce an evolution of connected structures similar to that of lightning strikes a streamer avalanche model 46 has recently been favored by observational data taken by lofar during storms 47 48 upward streamers upwards streamer emanating from the top of a pool cover when a stepped leader approaches the ground the presence of opposite charges on the ground enhances the strength of the electric field the electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud such as trees and tall buildings if the electric field is strong enough a positively charged ionic channel called a positive or upward streamer can develop from these points this was first theorized by heinz kasemir 49 50 51 as negatively charged leaders approach increasing the localized electric field strength grounded objects already experiencing corona discharge will exceed a threshold and form upward streamers attachment once a downward leader connects to an available upward leader a process referred to as attachment a low resistance path is formed and discharge may occur photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible the unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning none of which are connected to the earth although it may appear they are high speed videos can show the attachment process in progress 52 discharge return stroke return stroke redirects here for other uses see return stroke disambiguation high speed photography showing different parts of a lightning flash during the discharge process as seen in toulouse france once a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below there is a large drop in resistance across the lightning channel electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment which expands across the entire leader network at up to one third of the speed of light 53 this is the return stroke and it is the most luminous and noticeable part of the lightning discharge a large electric charge flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area this huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground called step potentials citation needed they are responsible for more injuries and deaths in groups of people or of other animals than the strike itself 54 electricity takes every path available to it 55 such step potentials will often flow through one leg and out another electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes the electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative cg flash often referred to as negative cg lightning in some cases a ground to cloud gc lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm these discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures such as communications antennas the rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100 000 km s one third of the speed of light 56 the massive flow of electric current occurring during the return stroke combined with the rate at which it occurs measured in microseconds rapidly superheats the completed leader channel forming a highly electrically conductive plasma channel the core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50 000 k causing it to radiate with a brilliant blue white color once the electric current stops flowing the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas the nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively producing a powerful shock wave which is heard as thunder re strike high speed videos examined frame by frame show that most negative cg lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes though there may be as many as 30 57 each re strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time typically 40 to 50 milliseconds as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes re strikes often cause a noticeable strobe light effect 58 to understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader s connection with the ground positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do for reasons not well understood bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re ionize the leader network these leaders also called recoil leaders usually decay shortly after their formation when they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network a return stroke like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader the dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes 59 each successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke each subsequent stroke usually re uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel 60 since recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article 59 transient currents during flash the electric current within a typical negative cg lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1 10 microseconds then decays more slowly over 50 200 microseconds the transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground based structures rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor in what is called the skin effect unlike direct currents which flow through the entire conductor like water through a hose hence conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi stranded with small wires woven together this increases the total bundle surface area in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius for a fixed total cross sectional area the rapidly changing currents also create electromagnetic pulses emps that radiate outward from the ionic channel this is a characteristic of all electrical discharges the radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases however if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines communication lines or metallic pipes they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination the surge current is inversely related to the surge impedance the higher in impedance the lower the current 61 this is the surge that more often than not results in the destruction of delicate electronics electrical appliances or electric motors devices known as surge protectors spd or transient voltage surge suppressors tvss attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash s transient irregular current and through alteration of its physical properties route the spike to an attached earthing ground thereby protecting the equipment from damage types three primary types of lightning are defined by the starting and ending points of a flash channel intra cloud ic or in cloud lightning occurs within a single thundercloud unit cloud to cloud cc or inter cloud lightning starts and ends between two different functional thundercloud units cloud to ground cg lightning primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an earth surface but may also occur in the reverse direction that is ground to cloud there are variations of each type such as positive versus negative cg flashes that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or to different events cloud to ground cg cloud to ground lightning 62 cloud to ground cg lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground it is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground cg is the least common but best understood of all types of lightning it is easier to study scientifically because it terminates on a physical object namely the earth and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground of the three primary types of lightning it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates on the earth or strikes the overall discharge termed a flash is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown stepped leaders connecting leaders return strokes dart leaders and subsequent return strokes 63 the conductivity of the electrical ground be it soil fresh water or salt water may affect the lightning discharge rate and thus visible characteristics 64 positive and negative lightning cloud to ground cg lightning is either positive or negative as defined by the direction of the conventional electric current between cloud and ground most cg lightning is negative meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel conventionally the current flows from the ground to the cloud the reverse happens in a positive cg flash where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground conventionally the current flows from the cloud to the ground positive lightning is less common than negative lightning and on average makes up less than 5 of all lightning strikes 65 a bolt from the blue lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear but the turbulent sky above the anvil cloud and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground they are commonly referred to as positive flashes despite the fact that they are usually negative in polarity there are six different mechanisms theorized to result in the formation of positive lightning 66 vertical wind shear displacing the upper positive charge region of a thundercloud exposing it to the ground below the loss of lower charge regions in the dissipating stage of a thunderstorm leaving the primary positive charge region a complex arrangement of charge regions in a thundercloud effectively resulting in an inverted dipole or inverted tripole in which the main negative charge region is above the main positive charge region instead of beneath it an unusually large lower positive charge region in the thundercloud cutoff of an extended negative leader from its origin which creates a new bidirectional leader in which the positive end strikes the ground commonly seen in anvil crawler spider flashes the initiation of a downward positive branch from an ic lightning flash contrary to popular belief positive lightning flashes do not necessarily originate from the anvil or the upper positive charge region and strike a rain free area outside of the thunderstorm this belief is based on the outdated idea that lightning leaders are unipolar and originate from their respective charge region citation needed positive lightning strikes tend to be much more intense than their negative counterparts an average bolt of negative lightning carries an electric current of 30 000 amperes 30 ka and transfers 15 c coulombs of electric charge and 1 gigajoule of energy large bolts of positive lightning can carry up to 120 ka and 350 c 67 the average positive ground flash has roughly double the peak current of a typical negative flash and can produce peak currents up to 400 ka and charges of several hundred coulombs 68 69 furthermore positive ground flashes with high peak currents are commonly followed by long continuing currents a correlation not seen in negative ground flashes 70 as a result of their greater power positive lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous than negative strikes positive lightning produces both higher peak currents and longer continuing currents making them capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited the long distances positive lightning can propagate through clear air explains why they are known as bolts from the blue giving no warning to observers despite the popular misconception that these clarification needed are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes they begin as ic flashes within the cloud the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away 71 72 positive lightning has also been shown to trigger the occurrence of upward lightning flashes from the tops of tall structures and is largely responsible for the initiation of sprites several tens of km above ground level positive lightning tends to occur more frequently in winter storms as with thundersnow during intense tornadoes 73 and in the dissipation stage of a thunderstorm 74 huge quantities of extremely low frequency elf and very low frequency vlf radio waves are also generated 75 cloud to cloud cc and intra cloud ic lightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground when it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as cloud to cloud cc or inter cloud lightning when it occurs between areas of differing electric potential within a single cloud it is known as intra cloud ic lightning ic lightning is the most frequently occurring type 74 ic lightning most commonly occurs between the upper anvil portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm this lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so called sheet lightning in such instances the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder another term used for cloud cloud or cloud cloud ground lightning is anvil crawler due to the habit of charge typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes these are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay the most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing branching of cloud to cloud lightning new delhi india multiple paths of cloud to cloud lightning swifts creek australia intra clouds lightning over the baltic sea observational variations anvil crawler over lake wright patman south of redwater texas on the backside of a large area of rain associated with a cold front anvil crawler lightning sometimes called spider lightning is created when leaders propagate through horizontally extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems these discharges usually begin as ic discharges originating within the convective region the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area if the leader becomes too long it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders when this happens the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive cg flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper atmospheric lightning 59 ball lightning may be an atmospheric electrical phenomenon the physical nature of which is still controversial the term refers to reports of luminous usually spherical objects which vary from pea sized to several metres in diameter 76 it is sometimes associated with thunderstorms but unlike lightning flashes which last only a fraction of a second ball lightning reportedly lasts many seconds ball lightning has been described by eyewitnesses but rarely recorded by meteorologists 77 78 scientific data on natural ball lightning is scarce owing to its infrequency and unpredictability the presumption of its existence is based on reported public sightings and has therefore produced somewhat inconsistent findings brett porter 79 a wildlife ranger reported taking a photo in queensland australia in 1987 bead lightning also known by the terms pearl lightning chain lightning perlschnurblitz and éclair en chapelet to name a few 80 is the decaying stage of a lightning channel in which the luminosity of the channel breaks up into segments 81 nearly every lightning discharge will exhibit beading as the channel cools immediately after a return stroke sometimes referred to as the lightning s bead out stage bead lightning is more properly a stage of a normal lightning discharge rather than a type of lightning in itself beading of a lightning channel is usually a small scale feature and therefore is often only apparent when the observer camera is close to the lightning 82 gigantic jet as seen from the summit of mauna kea hawaii clear air lightning describes lightning that occurs with no apparent cloud close enough to have produced it in the u s and canadian rockies a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not observable from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes either visually or audibly european and asian mountainous areas experience similar events also in areas such as sounds large lakes or open plains when the storm cell is on the near horizon within 26 km or 16 mi there may be some distant activity a strike can occur and as the storm is so far away the strike is referred to as a bolt from the blue 83 these flashes usually begin as normal ic lightning flashes before the negative leader exits the cloud and strikes the ground a considerable distance away 71 72 positive clear air strikes can occur in highly sheared environments where the upper positive charge region becomes horizontally displaced from the precipitation area 84 cloud to air lightning is a lightning flash in which one end of a bidirectional leader exits the cloud but does not result in a ground flash such flashes can sometimes be thought of as failed ground flashes blue jets and gigantic jets are a form of cloud to air or cloud to ionosphere lightning where a leader is launched from the top of a thunderstorm crown flash is a lightning flash accompanied by the brightening of the thunderhead crown followed by the emanation of aurora like streamers into the clear atmosphere dry lightning is lightning that occurs with no precipitation at the surface and is the most common natural cause of wildfires 85 pyrocumulus clouds produce lightning for the same reason that it is produced by cumulonimbus clouds citation needed this term is mainly used in australia canada and the united states forked lightning is cloud to ground lightning that exhibits branching of its path heat lightning is a lightning flash that appears to produce no discernible thunder because it occurs too far away for the thunder to be heard the sound waves dissipate before they reach the observer 86 ribbon lightning occurs in thunderstorms with high cross winds and multiple return strokes the wind will blow each successive return stroke slightly to one side of the previous return stroke causing a ribbon effect 87 rocket lightning is a form of cloud discharge generally horizontal and at cloud base with a luminous channel appearing to advance through the air with visually resolvable speed often intermittently 88 sheet lightning is cloud to cloud lightning that exhibits a diffuse brightening of the surface of a cloud caused by the actual discharge path being hidden or too far away the lightning itself cannot be seen by the spectator so it appears as only a flash or a sheet of light the lightning may be too far away to discern individual flashes smooth channel lightning is an informal term referring to a type of cloud to ground lightning strike that has no visible branching and appears like a line with smooth curves as opposed to the jagged appearance of most lightning channels they are a form of positive lightning generally observed in or near the convective regions of severe thunderstorms in the north central united states it is theorized that severe thunderstorms in this region obtain an inverted tripole charge structure in which the main positive charge region is located below the main negative charge region instead of above it and as a result these thunderstorms generate predominantly positive cloud to ground lightning the term smooth channel lightning is also sometimes attributed to upward ground to cloud lightning flashes which are generally negative flashes initiated by upward positive leaders from tall structures staccato lightning is a cloud to ground lightning cg strike which is a short duration stroke that often but not always appears as a single very bright flash and often has considerable branching 89 these are often found in the visual vault area near the mesocyclone of rotating thunderstorms and coincides with intensification of thunderstorm updrafts a similar cloud to cloud strike consisting of a brief flash over a small area appearing like a blip also occurs in a similar area of rotating updrafts 90 this cg was of very short duration exhibited highly branched channels and was very bright indicating that it was staccato lightning near new boston texas superbolts are rather loosely defined as strikes with a source energy of more than 100 gigajoule 100 gj most lightning strikes come in at around 1 gigajoule 1 gj events of this magnitude occur about as frequently as one in 240 strikes they are not categorically distinct from ordinary lightning strikes and simply represent the uppermost edge of a continuum contrary to popular misconception superbolts can be either positively or negatively charged and the charge ratio is comparable to that of ordinary lightning 91 92 93 sympathetic lightning is the tendency of lightning to be loosely coordinated across long distances discharges can appear in clusters when viewed from space 94 95 96 clarification needed upward lightning or ground to cloud lightning is a lightning flash which originates from the top of a grounded object and propagates upward from this point this type of lightning can be triggered by a preceding lightning flash or it may initiate entirely on its own the former is generally found in regions where spider lightning occurs and may involve multiple grounded objects simultaneously 97 the latter usually occurs during the cold season and may be the dominant lightning type in thundersnow events 98 effects lightning strike main article lightning strikethis section needs expansion with information about lightning strikes on ground vehicles further information on how aircraft are affected and further information on how animals and other living organisms are affected you can help by adding to it march 2021 effects on objects explosive steam pressure between trunk and bark from lightning strike blew away birch bark strike mark on trunk of an oklahoma black walnut objects struck by lightning experience heat and magnetic forces of great magnitude the heat created by lightning currents travelling through a tree may vaporize its sap causing a steam explosion that bursts the trunk as lightning travels through sandy soil the soil surrounding the plasma channel may melt forming tubular structures called fulgurites effects on buildings and vehicles strokes of cloud to ground lightning during a thunderstorm in the town of oradea buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unimpeded paths to the ground by safely conducting a lightning strike to the ground a lightning protection system usually incorporating at least one lightning rod can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage aircraft are highly susceptible to being struck due to their metallic fuselages but lightning strikes are generally not dangerous to them 99 due to the conductive properties of aluminium alloy the fuselage acts as a faraday cage present day aircraft are built to be safe from a lightning strike and passengers will generally not even know that it has happened effects on animals although 90 percent of people struck by lightning survive 100 animals including humans struck by lightning may suffer severe injury due to internal organ and nervous system damage other effects lightning serves an important role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into nitrates which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms 101 102 thunder main article thunder because the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning s path the sound origin s varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel by acoustic echoing from terrain and by the usually multiple stroke characteristic of the lightning strike light travels at about 300 000 000 m s 980 000 000 ft s and sound travels through air at about 343 m s 1 130 ft s an observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates a lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately 343 m 1 125 ft in distance a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about 1 km or 0 62 mi 3 343 m a flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately 1 7 km or 1 1 mi 5 343 m consequently a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder with almost no perceptible time lapse possibly accompanied by the smell of ozone o3 lightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over 160 km 100 mi whereas the thunder travels about 32 km 20 mi anecdotally there are many examples of people saying the storm was directly overhead or all around and yet there was no thunder since thunderclouds can be up to 20 km high 103 lightning occurring high up in the cloud may appear close but is actually too far away to produce noticeable thunder radio this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it september 2021 further information radio atmospheric signal and whistler radio lightning discharges generate radio frequency pulses which can be received thousands of kilometres from their source as radio atmospheric signals and whistlers high energy radiation further information terrestrial gamma ray flash the production of x rays by a bolt of lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 1925 104 but no evidence was found until 2001 2002 105 106 107 when researchers at the new mexico institute of mining and technology detected x ray emissions from an induced lightning strike along a grounded wire trailed behind a rocket shot into a storm cloud in the same year university of florida and florida tech researchers used an array of electric field and x ray detectors at a lightning research facility in north florida to confirm that natural lightning makes x rays in large quantities during the propagation of stepped leaders the cause of the x ray emissions is still a matter for research as the temperature of lightning is too low to account for the x rays observed 108 109 a number of observations by space based telescopes have revealed even higher energy gamma ray emissions the so called terrestrial gamma ray flashes tgfs these observations pose a challenge to current theories of lightning especially with the recent discovery of the clear signatures of antimatter produced in lightning 110 recent research has shown that secondary species produced by these tgfs such as electrons positrons neutrons or protons can gain energies of up to several tens of mev 111 112 ozone and nitrogen oxides the very high temperatures generated by lightning lead to significant local increases in ozone and oxides of nitrogen each lightning flash in temperate and sub tropical areas produces 7 kg of nox on average 113 in the troposphere the effect of lightning can increase nox by 90 and ozone by 30 114 volcanic main article volcanic lightning volcanic material thrust high into the atmosphere can trigger lightning volcanic activity produces lightning friendly conditions in multiple ways the enormous quantity of pulverized material and gases explosively ejected into the atmosphere creates a dense plume of particles the ash density and constant motion within the volcanic plume produces charge by frictional interactions triboelectrification resulting in very powerful and very frequent flashes as the cloud attempts to neutralize itself due to the extensive solid material ash content unlike the water rich charge generating zones of a normal thundercloud it is often called a dirty thunderstorm powerful and frequent flashes have been witnessed in the volcanic plume as far back as the 79 ad eruption of vesuvius by pliny the younger 115 likewise vapors and ash originating from vents on the volcano s flanks may produce more localized and smaller flashes upwards of 2 9 km long small short duration sparks recently documented near newly extruded magma attest to the material being highly charged prior to even entering the atmosphere 116 if the volcanic ash plume rises to freezing temperatures ice particles form and collide with ash particles to cause electrification lightning can be detected in any explosion but the causation of additional electrification from ice particles in ash can lead to a stronger electrical field and a higher rate of detectable lightning lightning is also used as a volcano monitoring tool for detecting hazardous eruptions 117 fire lightning intense forest fires such as those seen in the 2019 20 australian bushfire season can create their own weather systems that can produce lightning and other weather phenomena 118 intense heat from a fire causes air to rapidly rise within the smoke plume causing the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds cooler air is drawn in by this turbulent rising air helping to cool the plume the rising plume is further cooled by the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitude allowing the moisture in it to condense into cloud pyrocumulonimbus clouds form in an unstable atmosphere these weather systems can produce dry lightning fire tornadoes intense winds and dirty hail 118 extraterrestrial lightning has been observed within the atmospheres of other planets such as jupiter and saturn although in the minority on earth superbolts appear to be common on jupiter lightning on venus has been a controversial subject after decades of study during the soviet venera and u s pioneer missions of the 1970s and 1980s signals suggesting lightning may be present in the upper atmosphere were detected 119 although the cassini huygens mission fly by of venus in 1999 detected no signs of lightning the observation window lasted mere hours radio pulses recorded by the spacecraft venus express which began orbiting venus in april 2006 may originate from lightning on venus human related phenomena airplane contrails have also been observed to influence lightning to a small degree the water vapor dense contrails of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon the establishment of an ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow 120 rocket exhaust plumes provided a pathway for lightning when it was witnessed striking the apollo 12 rocket shortly after takeoff thermonuclear explosions by providing extra material for electrical conduction and a very turbulent localized atmosphere have been seen triggering lightning flashes within the mushroom cloud in addition intense gamma radiation from large nuclear explosions may develop intensely charged regions in the surrounding air through compton scattering the intensely charged space charge regions create multiple clear air lightning discharges shortly after the device detonates 121 scientific study the science of lightning is called fulminology properties thunder is heard as a rolling gradually dissipating rumble because the sound from different portions of a long stroke arrives at slightly different times 122 when the local electric field exceeds the dielectric strength of damp air about 3 mv m electrical discharge results in a strike often followed by commensurate discharges branching from the same path mechanisms that cause the charges to build up to lightning are still a matter of scientific investigation 123 124 a 2016 study confirmed dielectric breakdown is involved 125 lightning may be caused by the circulation of warm moisture filled air through electric fields 126 ice or water particles then accumulate charge as in a van de graaff generator 127 researchers at the university of florida found that the final one dimensional speeds of 10 flashes observed were between 1 0 105 and 1 4 106 m s with an average of 4 4 105 m s 128 detection and monitoring main article lightning detection lightning strike counter in a museum the earliest detector invented to warn of the approach of a thunderstorm was the lightning bell benjamin franklin installed one such device in his house 129 130 the detector was based on an electrostatic device called the electric chimes invented by andrew gordon in 1742 lightning discharges generate a wide range of electromagnetic radiations including radio frequency pulses the times at which a pulse from a given lightning discharge arrives at several receivers can be used to locate the source of the discharge with a precision on the order of metres the united states federal government has constructed a nationwide grid of such lightning detectors allowing lightning discharges to be tracked in real time throughout the continental u s 131 132 in addition a private global detection system that consists of over 500 detection stations owned and operated by hobbyists volunteers provides near real time lightning maps at blitzortung org the earth ionosphere waveguide traps electromagnetic vlf and elf waves electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide the waveguide is dispersive which means that their group velocity depends on frequency the difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver together with direction finding methods this allows locating lightning strikes up to distances of 10 000 km from their origin moreover the eigenfrequencies of the earth ionospheric waveguide the schumann resonances at about 7 5 hz are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity 133 in addition to ground based lightning detection several instruments aboard satellites have been constructed to observe lightning distribution these include the optical transient detector otd aboard the orbview 1 satellite launched on april 3 1995 and the subsequent lightning imaging sensor lis aboard trmm launched on november 28 1997 134 135 136 starting in 2016 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration launched geostationary operational environmental satellite r series goes r weather satellites outfitted with geostationary lightning mapper glm instruments which are near infrared optical transient detectors that can detect the momentary changes in an optical scene indicating the presence of lightning 137 138 the lighting detection data can be converted into a real time map of lightning activity across the western hemisphere this mapping technique has been implemented by the united states national weather service 139 in 2022 eumetsat plan to launch the lightning imager mtg i li on board meteosat third generation this will complement noaa s glm mtg i li will cover europe and africa and will include products on events groups and flashes 140 artificially triggered rocket triggered lightning can be triggered by launching specially designed rockets trailing spools of wire into thunderstorms the wire unwinds as the rocket ascends creating an elevated ground that can attract descending leaders if a leader attaches the wire provides a low resistance pathway for a lightning flash to occur the wire is vaporized by the return current flow creating a straight lightning plasma channel in its place this method allows for scientific research of lightning to occur under a more controlled and predictable manner 141 the international center for lightning research and testing iclrt at camp blanding florida typically uses rocket triggered lightning in their research studies laser triggered since the 1970s 142 researchers have attempted to trigger lightning strikes by means of infrared or ultraviolet lasers which create a channel of ionized gas through which the lightning would be conducted to ground such triggering of lightning is intended to protect rocket launching pads electric power facilities and other sensitive targets 143 144 145 146 147 in new mexico u s scientists tested a new terawatt laser which provoked lightning scientists fired ultra fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region the laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as filaments before the lightning strikes earth the filaments lead electricity through the clouds playing the role of lightning rods researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike nevertheless a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered according to the french and german scientists who ran the experiment the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand 148 statistical analysis showed that their laser pulses indeed enhanced the electrical activity in the thundercloud where it was aimed in effect they generated small local discharges located at the position of the plasma channels 149 physical manifestations lightning induced remanent magnetization lirm mapped during a magnetic field gradient survey of an archaeological site located in wyoming united states magnetism the movement of electrical charges produces a magnetic field see electromagnetism the intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field where the lightning current path passes through rock soil or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized this effect is known as lightning induced remanent magnetism or lirm these currents follow the least resistive path often horizontally near the surface 150 151 but sometimes vertically where faults ore bodies or ground water offers a less resistive path 152 one theory suggests that lodestones natural magnets encountered in ancient times were created in this manner 153 lightning induced magnetic anomalies can be mapped in the ground 154 155 and analysis of magnetized materials can confirm lightning was the source of the magnetization 156 and provide an estimate of the peak current of the lightning discharge 157 research at the university of innsbruck has found that magnetic fields generated by plasma may induce hallucinations in subjects located within 200 m 660 ft of a severe lightning storm 158 solar wind and cosmic rays some high energy cosmic rays produced by supernovas as well as solar particles from the solar wind enter the atmosphere and electrify the air which may create pathways for lightning bolts 159 lightning and climate change due to the low resolution of global climate models accurately representing lightning in these climate models is difficult largely due to their inability to simulate the convection and cloud ice imperative which are fundamental to lightning formation research from the future climate for africa programme demonstrates that using a convection permitting model over africa can more accurately capture convective thunderstorms and the distribution of ice particles this research indicates climate change may increase the total amount of lightning only slightly the total number of lightning days per year decreases while more cloud ice and stronger convection leads to more lightning strikes occurring on days when lightning does occur 160 a study from the university of washington looked at lightning activity in the arctic from 2010 to 2020 the ratio of arctic summertime strokes was compared to total global strokes and was observed to be increasing with time indicating that the region is becoming more influenced by lightning the fraction of strokes above 65 degrees north was found to be increasing linearly with the noaa global temperature anomaly and grew by a factor of 3 as the anomaly increased from 0 65 to 0 95 c 161 paleolightning these paragraphs are an excerpt from paleolightning edit paleolightning refers to the remnants of ancient lightning activity studied in fields such as historical geology geoarchaeology and fulminology paleolightning provides tangible evidence for the study lightning activity in earth s past and the roles lightning may have played in earth s history some studies have speculated that lightning activity played a crucial role in the development of not only earth s early atmosphere but also early life lightning a non biological process has been found to produce biologically useful material through the oxidation and reduction of inorganic matter 162 research on the impact of lightning on earth s atmosphere continues today especially with regard to feedback mechanisms of lightning produced nitrate compounds on atmospheric composition and global average temperatures 163 detecting lightning activity in the geologic record can be difficult given the instantaneous nature of lightning strikes in general however fulgurite a glassy tube like crust like or irregular mineraloid that forms when lightning fuses soil quartz sands clay rock biomass or caliche is prevalent in electrically active regions around the globe and provides evidence of not only past lightning activity but also patterns of convection 164 since lightning channels carry an electric current to the ground lightning can produce magnetic fields as well while lightning magnetic anomalies can provide evidence of lightning activity in a region these anomalies are often problematic for those examining the magnetic record of rock types because they disguise the natural magnetic fields present 165 in culture and religion religion and mythology further information lightning in religion lightning by mikalojus konstantinas ciurlionis 1909 in many cultures lightning has been viewed as part of a deity or a deity in and of itself these include the greek god zeus the aztec god tlaloc the mayan god k slavic mythology s perun the baltic pērkons perkūnas thor in norse mythology ukko in finnish mythology the hindu god indra the yoruba god sango illapa in inca mythology and the shinto god raijin 166 in the traditional religion of the african bantu tribes lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods scriptures in judaism islam and christianity also ascribe supernatural importance to lightning in christianity the second coming of jesus is compared to lightning matthew 24 27 luke 17 24 expressions and sayings the expression lightning never strikes twice in the same place is similar to opportunity never knocks twice in the vein of a once in a lifetime opportunity i e something that is generally considered improbable lightning occurs frequently and more so in specific areas since various factors alter the probability of strikes at any given location repeat lightning strikes have a very low probability but are not impossible 167 168 similarly a bolt from the blue refers to something totally unexpected and a person being struck by lightning is an imaginative or comedic metaphor for someone to experience a once in a lifetime striking sudden lightning speed revelation similar to an epiphany or an enlightenment in french and italian the expression for love at first sight is coup de foudre and colpo di fulmine respectively which literally translated means lightning strike some european languages have a separate word for lightning which strikes the ground as opposed to lightning in general often it is a cognate of the english word rays the name of australia s most celebrated thoroughbred horse phar lap derives from the shared zhuang and thai word for lightning 169 political and military culture two lightning bolts pictured in the former coat of arms of the yli ii municipality the bolt of lightning in heraldry is called a thunderbolt and is shown as a zigzag with non pointed ends this symbol usually represents power and speed some political parties use lightning flashes as a symbol of power such as the people s action party in singapore the british union of fascists during the 1930s and the national states rights party in the united states during the 1950s 170 the schutzstaffel the paramilitary wing of the nazi party used the sig rune in their logo which symbolizes lightning the german word blitzkrieg which means lightning war was a major offensive strategy of the german army during world war ii the lightning bolt is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world a lightning bolt is also the nato symbol for a signal asset data of injuries and deaths main article lightning strike epidemiology the deadliest single direct lightning strike occurred when 21 people died as they huddled for safety in a hut that was hit 1975 zimbabwe 39 the deadliest single indirect lightning strike was the 1994 dronka lightning strike 469 people died when lightning struck a set of oil tanks in 1994 causing burning oil to flood a town 1994 dronka egypt 39 in the united states an average of 23 people died from lightning per year from 2012 to 2021 171 see also environment portal weather portal apollo 12 a saturn v rocket

construction violin family violinists vte a fiddle is a bowed string musical instrument most often a violin 1 it is a colloquial term for the violin used by players in all genres including classical music although in many cases violins and fiddles are essentially synonymous the style of the music played may determine specific construction differences between fiddles and classical violins for example fiddles may optionally be set up with a bridge with a flatter arch to reduce the range of bow arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle a form of bariolage involving rapid alternation between pairs of adjacent strings 2 to produce a brighter tone than the deep tones of gut or synthetic core strings fiddlers often use steel strings the fiddle is part of many traditional folk styles which are typically aural traditions taught by ear rather than via written music 3 fiddling is the act of playing the fiddle and fiddlers are musicians that play it among musical styles fiddling tends to produce rhythms that focus on dancing with associated quick note changes whereas classical music tends to contain more vibrato and sustained notes fiddling is also open to improvisation and embellishment with ornamentation at the player s discretion in contrast to orchestral performances which adhere to the composer s notes to reproduce a work faithfully it is less

references 7 1 citations 7 2 sources 8 external links history edit the medieval fiddle emerged in 10th century europe deriving from the byzantine lira greek λύρα latin lira english lyre a bowed string instrument of the byzantine empire and ancestor of most european bowed instruments 5 6 the first recorded reference to the bowed lira was in the 9th century by the persian geographer ibn khurradadhbih d 911 in his lexicographical discussion of instruments he cited the lira lūrā as a typical instrument of the byzantines and equivalent to the rabāb played in the islamic empires 7 lira spread widely westward to europe in the 11th and 12th centuries european writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments 5 west african fiddlers have accompanied singing and dancing with one string gourd fiddles since the twelfth century citation needed and many black musicians in america learned on similar homemade fiddles before switching over to the european violin as early as the mid 1600s black fiddlers exquisite performers on three stringed fiddles were playing for both black and white dancers at street celebrations in the dutch settlement of new amsterdam new york city and by 1690 slave fiddlers were routinely providing the music at plantation balls in virginia 8 over the centuries europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddles one relatively square shaped held in the arms became known as the viola da braccio arm viol family and evolved into the violin the other with sloping shoulders and held between the knees was the viola da gamba leg viol group during the renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments they eventually lost ground to the louder and originally less aristocratic viola da braccio family 9 etymology edit the etymology of fiddle is uncertain it probably derives from the latin fidula which is the early word for violin or it may be natively germanic 10 the name appears to be related to icelandic fiðla and also old english fiðele 11 a native germanic ancestor of fiddle might even be the ancestor of the early romance form of violin 12 in medieval times fiddle also referred to a predecessor of today s violin like the violin it tended to have four strings but came in a variety of shapes and sizes another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols which are held between the legs and played vertically and have fretted fingerboards 13 ensembles edit fiddlers participating in a session at a pub in ireland in performance a solo fiddler or one or two with a group of other instrumentalists is the norm though twin fiddling is represented in some north american scandinavian scottish and irish styles following the folk revivals of the second half of the 20th century it became common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddlers playing together see for example the calgary fiddlers swedish spelmanslag folk musician clubs and the worldwide phenomenon of irish sessions 14 15 orchestral violins on the other hand are commonly grouped in sections or chairs these contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments before electronic amplification than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in the difference was likely compounded by the different sounds expected of violin music and fiddle music historically the majority of fiddle music was dance music 3 while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely violin music came to value a smoothness that fiddling with its dance driven clear beat did not always follow in situations that required greater volume a fiddler as long as they kept the beat could push their instrument harder than could a violinist citation needed various fiddle traditions have differing values scottish with cello edit in the very late 20th century a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the scottish tradition of violin and big fiddle or cello notable recorded examples include iain fraser and christine hanson amelia kaminski and christine hanson s bonnie lasses 16 alasdair fraser and natalie haas fire and grace 17 and tim macdonald and jeremy ward s the wilds 18 balkan with kontra edit hungarian slovenian and romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three stringed variant of the viola known as the kontra and by double bass with cimbalom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band in hungary a three stringed viola variant with a flat bridge called the kontra or háromhúros brácsa makes up part of a traditional rhythm section in hungarian folk music the flat bridge lets the musician play three string chords a three stringed double bass variant is also used styles edit to a greater extent than classical violin playing fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions each of which has its own distinctive sound europe edit great britain edit english folk music fiddling including northumbrian fiddle style which features seconding

tradition strongly influenced by baroque violin technique with staccato and scotch snap bowing techniques and double stops a scottish borders tradition with a repertoire heavy in hornpipes and with heavy use of double stops a highland tradition highly influenced by the ornamentation and mixolydian scale of the great highland bagpipe as well as smoother bowing than other scottish fiddle styles and a swinging of the 6 8 jig rhythm a west highland and hebridean tradition very closely related to the highland tradition with major influence from the gaelic song tradition an orkney tradition with

fiddling from the northwest in ulster which features mazurkas and a scottish influenced repertoire including strathspey and highland fling dances fiddlers tend to play fast and make heavy use of

donegal fiddling tends to be fast but with a bouncier feel to the bowing galway fiddling southern connacht which is slower than sligo or donegal traditions with a heavier emphasis on ornamentation

of action potentials may result in macroscopic oscillations that can be measured outside the scalp neural oscillations or brainwaves are rhythmic or repetitive patterns of neural activity in the central nervous system neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity in many ways driven either by mechanisms within individual neurons or by interactions between neurons in individual neurons oscillations can appear either as oscillations in membrane potential or as rhythmic patterns of action potentials which then produce oscillatory activation of post synaptic neurons at the level of neural ensembles synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons can give rise to macroscopic oscillations which can be observed in an electroencephalogram oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns the interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons a well known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is alpha activity neural oscillations in humans were observed by researchers as early as 1924 by hans berger more than 50 years later intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons but its functional role is still not fully understood 1 the possible roles of neural oscillations include feature binding information transfer mechanisms and the generation of rhythmic motor output over the last decades more insight has been gained especially with advances in brain imaging a major area of research in neuroscience involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different levels of organization and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations a unified interpretation

general oscillations can be characterized by their frequency amplitude and phase these signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using time frequency analysis in large scale oscillations amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a neural ensemble also referred to as local synchronization in addition to local synchronization oscillatory activity of distant neural structures single neurons or neural ensembles can synchronize neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer perception motor control and memory 5 6 7 8 five frequency bands of neural oscillation as seen in ten seconds of eeg neural oscillations have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons large scale activity can be measured by techniques such as eeg in general eeg signals have a broad spectral content similar to pink noise but also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands the first discovered and best known frequency band is alpha activity 8 12 hz 9 10 11 that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed 12 other frequency bands are delta 1 4 hz theta 4 8 hz beta 13 30 hz low gamma 30 70 hz 13 and high gamma 70 150 hz frequency bands where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing indeed eeg signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves in fact different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content 14 consequently neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states such as awareness and consciousness 15 16 13 11 although neural oscillations in human brain activity are mostly investigated using eeg recordings they are also observed using more invasive recording techniques such as single unit recordings neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of action potentials or spikes some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies so called resonators 17 bursting is another form of rhythmic spiking spiking patterns are considered fundamental for information coding in the brain oscillatory activity can also be observed in the form of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations i e in the absence of action potentials 18 if numerous neurons spike in synchrony they can give rise to oscillations in local field potentials quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data 19 neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of neurodynamics an area of research in the cognitive sciences that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing brain function 20 it considers the brain a dynamical system and uses differential equations to describe how neural activity evolves over time in particular it aims to relate dynamic patterns of brain activity to cognitive functions such as perception and memory in very abstract form neural oscillations can be analyzed analytically when studied in a more physiologically realistic setting oscillatory activity is generally studied using computer simulations of a computational model the functions of neural oscillations are wide ranging and vary for different types of oscillatory activity examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a heartbeat and the neural binding of sensory features in perception such as the shape and color of an object neural oscillations also play an important role in many neurological disorders such as excessive synchronization during seizure activity in epilepsy or tremor in patients with parkinson s disease oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices such as a brain computer interface 21 physiology edit main article electrophysiology oscillatory activity is observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels of organization three different levels have been widely recognized the micro scale activity of a single neuron the meso scale activity of a local group of neurons and the macro scale activity of different brain regions 22 tonic firing pattern of single neuron showing rhythmic spiking activity microscopic edit neurons generate action potentials resulting from changes in the electric membrane potential neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so called spike trains these spike trains are the basis for neural coding and information transfer in the brain spike trains can form all kinds of patterns such as rhythmic spiking and bursting and often display oscillatory activity 23 oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in sub threshold fluctuations in membrane potential these rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential they can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons neuronal spiking can be classified by their activity patterns the excitability of neurons can be subdivided in class i and ii class i neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength whereas class ii neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength 17 class ii neurons are also more prone to display sub threshold oscillations in membrane potential mesoscopic edit a group of neurons can also generate oscillatory activity through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up constructive interference that is synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas which gives rise to large amplitude oscillations of the local field potential these large scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography eeg and magnetoencephalography meg the electric potentials generated by single neurons are far too small to be picked up outside the scalp and eeg or meg activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation 24 neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment i e fully synchronized instead the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity see figure at top of page as such the frequency of large scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random however if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency they will generate oscillations in the mean field see also figure at top of page 23 neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in particular inhibitory interneurons play an important role in producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons 25 macroscopic edit neural oscillation can also arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural connectome time delays play an important role here because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled these connections between brain areas form feedback loops positive feedback loops tend to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the delay time an example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the thalamus and cortex the thalamocortical radiations this thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as recurrent thalamo cortical resonance 26 the thalamocortical network plays an important role in the generation of alpha activity 27 28 in a whole brain network model with realistic anatomical connectivity and propagation delays between brain areas oscillations in the beta frequency range emerge from the partial synchronisation of subsets of brain areas oscillating in the gamma band generated at the mesoscopic level 29 mechanisms edit neuronal properties edit see also action potential and bursting scientists have identified some intrinsic neuronal properties that play an important role in generating membrane potential oscillations in particular voltage gated ion channels are critical in the generation of action potentials the dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well established hodgkin huxley model that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations using bifurcation analysis different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses the oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the hodgkin huxley model closely agree with empirical findings in addition to periodic spiking subthreshold membrane potential oscillations i e resonance behavior that does not result in action potentials may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons 30 31 like pacemaker neurons in central pattern generators subtypes of cortical cells fire bursts of spikes brief clusters of spikes rhythmically at preferred frequencies bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance 23 network properties edit see also connectome apart from intrinsic properties of neurons biological neural network properties are also an important source of oscillatory activity neurons communicate with one another via synapses and affect the timing of spike trains in the post synaptic neurons depending on the properties of the connection such as the coupling strength time delay and whether coupling is excitatory or inhibitory the spike trains of the interacting neurons may become synchronized 32 neurons are locally connected forming small clusters that are called neural ensembles certain network structures promote oscillatory activity at specific frequencies for example neuronal activity generated by two populations of interconnected inhibitory and excitatory cells can show spontaneous oscillations that are described by the wilson cowan model if a group of neurons engages in synchronized oscillatory activity the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator 22 different neural ensembles are coupled through long range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity 33 long range connections between different brain structures such as the thalamus and the cortex see thalamocortical oscillation involve time delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons because most connections are reciprocal they form feed back loops that support oscillatory activity oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and granger causality measures 34 coherent activity of large scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information 16 neuromodulation edit main article neuromodulation in addition to fast direct synaptic interactions between neurons forming a network oscillatory activity is regulated by neuromodulators on a much slower time scale that is the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity for instance gaba concentration has been shown to be positively correlated with frequency of oscillations in induced stimuli 35 a number of nuclei in the brainstem have diffuse projections throughout the brain influencing concentration levels of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine acetylcholine and serotonin these neurotransmitter systems affect the physiological state e g wakefulness or arousal and have a pronounced effect on amplitude of different brain waves such as alpha activity 36 mathematical description edit see also computational neuroscience oscillations can often be described and analyzed using mathematics mathematicians have identified several dynamical mechanisms that generate rhythmicity among the most important are harmonic linear oscillators limit cycle oscillators and delayed feedback oscillators 37 harmonic oscillations appear very frequently in nature examples are sound waves the motion of a pendulum and vibrations of every sort they generally arise when a physical system is perturbed by a small degree from a minimum energy state and are well understood mathematically noise driven harmonic oscillators realistically simulate alpha rhythm in the waking eeg as well as slow waves and spindles in the sleep eeg successful eeg analysis algorithms were based on such models several other eeg components are better described by limit cycle or delayed feedback oscillations limit cycle oscillations arise from physical systems that show large deviations from equilibrium whereas delayed feedback oscillations arise when components of a system affect each other after significant time delays limit cycle oscillations can be complex but there are powerful mathematical tools for analyzing them the mathematics of delayed feedback oscillations is primitive in comparison linear oscillators and limit cycle oscillators qualitatively differ in terms of how they respond to fluctuations in input in a linear oscillator the frequency is more or less constant but the amplitude can vary greatly in a limit cycle oscillator the amplitude tends to be more or less constant but the frequency can vary greatly a heartbeat is an example of a limit cycle oscillation in that the frequency of beats varies widely while each individual beat continues to pump about the same amount of blood computational models adopt a variety of abstractions in order to describe complex oscillatory dynamics observed in brain activity many models are used in the field each defined at a different level of abstraction and trying to model different aspects of neural systems they range from models of the short term behaviour of individual neurons through models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons to models of how behaviour can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems single neuron model edit simulation of a hindmarsh rose neuron showing typical bursting behavior a fast rhythm generated by individual spikes and a slower rhythm generated by the bursts see also biological neuron model a model of a biological neuron is a mathematical description of the properties of nerve cells or neurons that is designed to accurately describe and predict its biological processes the most successful and widely used model of neurons the hodgkin huxley model is based on data from the squid giant axon it is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of a neuron in particular the generation and propagation of action potentials the model is very accurate and detailed and hodgkin and huxley received the 1963 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for this work the mathematics of the hodgkin huxley model are quite complicated and several simplifications have been proposed such as the fitzhugh nagumo model the hindmarsh rose model or the capacitor switch model 38 as an extension of the integrate and fire model such models only capture the basic neuronal dynamics such as rhythmic spiking and bursting but are more computationally efficient this allows the simulation of a large number of interconnected neurons that form a neural network spiking model edit see also neural network a neural network model describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit these models aim to describe how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons local interactions between neurons can result in the synchronization of spiking activity and form the basis of oscillatory activity in particular models of interacting pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons have been shown to generate brain rhythms such as gamma activity 39 similarly it was shown that simulations of neural networks with a phenomenological model for neuronal response failures can predict spontaneous broadband neural oscillations 40 neural mass model edit simulation of a neural mass model showing network spiking during the onset of a seizure 41 as the gain a is increased the network starts to oscillate at 3hz see also wilson cowan model neural field models are another important tool in studying neural oscillations and are a mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time in modeling the activity of large numbers of neurons the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit resulting in spatially continuous neural networks instead of modelling individual neurons this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions it is based on the mean field approach an area of statistical physics that deals with large scale systems models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and eeg rhythms they have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations 42 kuramoto model edit simulation of kuramoto model showing neural synchronization and oscillations in the mean field main article kuramoto model the kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators 43 is one of the most abstract and fundamental models used to investigate neural oscillations and synchronization it captures the activity of a local system e g a single neuron or neural ensemble by its circular phase alone and hence ignores the amplitude of oscillations amplitude is constant 44 interactions amongst these oscillators are introduced by a simple algebraic form such as a sine function and collectively generate a dynamical pattern at the global scale the kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity 45 in particular it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large scale oscillations simulations using the kuramoto model with realistic long range cortical connectivity and time delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting state bold functional maps which can be measured using fmri 46 activity patterns edit both single neurons and groups of neurons can generate oscillatory activity spontaneously in addition they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output some types of neurons will fire rhythmically in the absence of any synaptic input likewise brain wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity so called resting state activity these ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption which is referred to as phase resetting in addition external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all resulting in an additive response oscillatory responses the frequency of ongoing oscillatory activity is increased between t1 and t2 the amplitude of ongoing oscillatory activity is increased between t1 and t2 the phase of ongoing oscillatory activity is reset at t1 activity is linearly added to ongoing oscillatory activity between t1 and t2 ongoing activity edit spontaneous activity is brain activity in the absence of an explicit task such as sensory input or motor output and hence also referred to as resting state activity it is opposed to induced activity i e brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses the term ongoing brain activity is used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events such as moving a body part i e events that do not form evoked potentials evoked fields or induced activity spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing however spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development such as in network formation and synaptogenesis spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person e g wakefulness alertness and is often used in sleep research certain types of oscillatory activity such as alpha waves are part of spontaneous activity statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution i e a high and low amplitude mode and hence shows that resting state activity does not just reflect a noise process 47 in case of fmri spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent bold signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks such as the default network 48 the temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory eeg activity in different frequency bands 49 ongoing brain activity may also have an important role in perception as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli indeed eeg studies suggest that visual perception is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations for instance the amplitude and phase of alpha activity at the moment of visual stimulation predicts whether a weak stimulus will be perceived by the subject 50 51 52 frequency response edit in response to input a neuron or neuronal ensemble may change the frequency at which it oscillates thus changing the rate at which it spikes often a neuron s firing rate depends on the summed activity it receives frequency changes are also commonly observed in central pattern generators and directly relate to the speed of motor activities such as step frequency in walking however changes in relative oscillation frequency between different brain areas is not so common because the frequency of oscillatory activity is often related to the time delays between brain areas amplitude response edit next to evoked activity neural activity related to stimulus processing may result in induced activity induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation hence they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses a well studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity for instance gamma activity often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation 53 because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging they can only be obtained using time frequency analysis induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons increases in oscillatory activity are therefore often referred to as event related synchronization while decreases are referred to as event related desynchronization 54 phase resetting edit phase resetting occurs when input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets the phase of ongoing oscillations 55 it is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input which is referred to as phase locking 17 and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions 16 33 because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons phase resetting also permits the study of evoked activity a term used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for responses in brain activity that are directly related to stimulus related activity evoked potentials and event related potentials are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus locked averaging i e averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus as a consequence those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others i e ongoing or spontaneous activity are averaged out that is event related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase locked to the stimulus or event evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity although this is an ongoing debate 56 57 asymmetric amplitude modulation edit it has recently been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials induced activity may still cause event related potentials because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus amplitude modulations may result in a baseline shift that does not average out 58 59 this model implies that slow event related responses such as asymmetric alpha activity could result from asymmetric brain oscillation amplitude modulations such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites 60 under this assumption asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by eeg and meg since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate eeg and meg signals that can be measured at the scalp 61 function edit neural synchronization can be modulated by task constraints such as attention and is thought to play a role in feature binding 62 neuronal communication 5 and motor coordination 7 neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in neuroscience in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by gray singer and others appeared to support the neural binding hypothesis 63 according to this idea synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object for example when a person looks at a tree visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree this phenomenon is best seen in local field potentials which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons but has also been shown in eeg and meg recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping 62 and attentional top down control 13 11 10 pacemaker edit main article cardiac pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node located in the right atrium of the heart spontaneously depolarize approximately 100 times per minute although all of the heart s cells have the ability to generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction the sinoatrial node normally initiates it simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas hence these cells generate the normal sinus rhythm and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the heart rate in the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control cells in the sa node will rhythmically discharge the sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells central pattern generator edit main article central pattern generator synchronized firing of neurons also forms the basis of periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements these rhythmic outputs are produced by a group of interacting neurons that form a network called a central pattern generator central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that when activated can produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information examples are walking breathing and swimming 64 most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals such as the lamprey but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans 65 66 information processing edit main article neural coding neuronal spiking is generally considered the basis for information transfer in the brain for such a transfer information needs to be coded in a spiking pattern different types of coding schemes have been proposed such as rate coding and temporal coding neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes 67 perception edit see also binding problem synchronization of neuronal firing may serve as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing i e to exploit temporal synchrony to encode relations purely theoretical formulations of the binding by synchrony hypothesis were proposed first 68 but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of synchrony as a relational code 69 the functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex these experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli the frequency of these oscillations was in the range of 40 hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions 69 similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of eckhorn providing further evidence for the functional role of neural synchronization in feature binding 70 since then numerous studies have replicated these findings and extended them to different modalities such as eeg providing extensive evidence of the functional role of gamma oscillations in visual perception gilles laurent and colleagues showed that oscillatory synchronization has an important functional role in odor perception perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles 71 these oscillations can be disrupted by gaba blocker picrotoxin 72 and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees 73 and to more similar responses across odors in downstream β lobe neurons 74 recent follow up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for kenyon cells in the insect mushroom body such that incoming spikes from the antennal lobe are more effective in activating kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle 67 neural oscillations are also thought be involved in the sense of time 75 and in somatosensory perception 76 however recent findings argue against a clock like function of cortical gamma oscillations 77 motor coordination edit main article motor coordination oscillations have been commonly reported in the motor system pfurtscheller and colleagues found a reduction in alpha 8 12 hz and beta 13 30 hz oscillations in eeg activity when subjects made a movement 54 78 using intra cortical recordings similar changes in oscillatory activity were found in the motor cortex when the monkeys performed motor acts that required significant attention 79 80 in addition oscillations at spinal level become synchronised to beta oscillations in the motor cortex during constant muscle activation as determined by cortico muscular coherence 81 82 83 likewise muscle activity of different muscles reveals inter muscular coherence at multiple distinct frequencies reflecting the underlying neural circuitry involved in motor coordination 84 85 recently it was found that cortical oscillations propagate as travelling waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex 86 it has been proposed that motor commands in the form of travelling waves can be spatially filtered by the descending fibres to selectively control muscle force 87 simulations have shown that ongoing wave activity in cortex can elicit steady muscle force with physiological levels of eeg emg coherence 88 oscillatory rhythms at 10 hz have been recorded in a brain area called the inferior olive which is associated with the cerebellum 18 these oscillations are also observed in motor output of physiological tremor 89 and when performing slow finger movements 90 these findings may indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently in support it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello thalamo cortical loop which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control 91 memory edit main article memory neural oscillations in particular theta activity are extensively linked to memory function theta rhythms are very strong in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval and they are believed to be vital to the induction of long term potentiation a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory coupling between theta and gamma activity is thought to be vital for memory functions including episodic memory 92 93 tight coordination of single neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory 94 sleep and consciousness edit main article sleep sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness and proceeds in cycles of rapid eye movement rem and non rapid eye movement nrem sleep sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of eeg for instance stage n1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves common in the awake state to theta waves whereas stage n3 deep or slow wave sleep is characterized by the presence of delta waves 95 the normal order of sleep stages is n1 n2 n3 n2 rem citation needed development edit neural oscillations may play a role in neural development for example retinal waves are thought to have properties that define early connectivity of circuits and synapses between cells in the retina 96 pathology edit handwriting of a person affected by parkinson s disease showing rhythmic tremor activity in the strokes generalized 3 hz spike and wave discharges reflecting seizure activity specific types of neural oscillations may also appear in pathological situations such as parkinson s disease or epilepsy these pathological oscillations often consist of an aberrant version of a normal oscillation for example one of the best known types is the spike and wave oscillation which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations tremor edit main article tremor a tremor is an involuntary somewhat rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation involving to and fro movements of one or more body parts it is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands arms eyes face head vocal cords trunk and legs most tremors occur in the hands in some people tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder many different forms of tremor have been identified such as essential tremor or parkinsonian tremor it is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances 97 epilepsy edit main article epilepsy epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by seizures these seizures are transient signs and or symptoms of abnormal excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal activity in the brain 98 thalamocortical dysrhythmia edit main article thalamocortical dysrhythmia in thalamocortical dysrhythmia tcd normal thalamocortical resonance is disrupted the thalamic loss of input allows the frequency of the thalamo cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band as identified by meg and eeg by machine learning 99 tcd can be treated with neurosurgical methods like thalamotomy applications edit clinical endpoints edit neural oscillations are sensitive to several drugs influencing brain activity accordingly biomarkers based on neural oscillations are emerging as secondary endpoints in clinical trials and in quantifying effects in pre clinical studies these biomarkers are often named eeg biomarkers or neurophysiological biomarkers and are quantified using quantitative electroencephalography qeeg eeg biomarkers can be extracted from the eeg using the open source neurophysiological biomarker toolbox brain computer interface edit main article brain computer interface neural oscillation has been applied as a control signal in various brain computer interfaces bcis 100 for example a non invasive bci can be created by placing electrodes on the scalp and then measuring the weak electric signals although individual neuron activities cannot be recorded through non invasive bci because the skull damps and blurs the electromagnetic signals oscillatory activity can still be reliably detected the bci was introduced by vidal in 1973 101 as challenge of using eeg signals to control objects outside human body after the bci challenge in 1988 alpha rhythm was used in a brain rhythm based bci for control of a physical object a robot 102 103 alpha rhythm based bci was the first bci for control of a robot 104 105 in particular some forms of bci allow users to control a device by measuring the amplitude of oscillatory activity in specific

7 nabu was worshipped in babylon s sister city borsippa from where his statue was taken to babylon each new year so that he could pay his respects to his father 7 nabu s symbols included a stylus resting on a tablet as well as a simple wedge shape king nabonidus whose name references nabu had a royal sceptre topped with nabu s wedge 7 8 33 34 clay tablets with especial calligraphic skill were used as offerings at nabu s temple his wife was the akkadian goddess tashmet 7 nabu was the patron god of scribes literacy and wisdom 7 he was also the inventor of writing a divine scribe the patron god of the rational arts and a god of vegetation 8 33 34 9 as the god of writing nabu inscribed the fates assigned to men and he was equated with the scribe god ninurta 9 10 as an oracle he was associated with the mesopotamian moon god sin 8 33 34 originally the planet mercury was connected with ninurta as well as saturn because in the mul apin ninurta is consistently identified with mercury 11 12 13 and it is read that mercury whose name is ninurta travels the same path the moon travels as marduk took over the role of king of the gods from enlil and inherited both his cultic roles and epithets as well as his position within the pantheon the role of the most important son of the father of the gods that had previously belonged to ninurta as son of enlil now replaced by marduk was thus taken over by nabu and nabu became associated with the planet mercury as well as being given connections with the moon god sin because as addressed in the mul apin even when mercury was considered the planet of ninurta it still retained some moon like aspects since it traveled the same path of the moon nabu wore a horned cap and stood with his hands clasped in the ancient gesture of priesthood he rode on a winged dragon known as sirrush that originally belonged to his father marduk in babylonian astrology nabu was identified with the planet mercury 14 15 nabu was continuously

formidable 65 while his powers through the helm were initially provided by nabu hauhet later becomes a patron of the helm after it was damaged granting him new powers but also forcing him to rely on

fate also possess the ability to mystically merge both body and souls with another also selected to be doctor fate creating a magical being that calls themselves dr fate and access a greater level of power 44 mystic artifacts edit helmet of fate edit the helmet of fate sometimes called the helm of fate helmet of anubis helmet of thoth or helm of thoth is a magical corinthian helmet that grants the bearer godly level powers and is considered one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the dc universe while most continuities establish it to be a creation of nabu the fourth doctor fate series presents a different origin the helm instead associated with thoth and is presented with an altered origin the object of power being rooted in the dc s version of egyptian mythology being a creation of osiris and thoth s hand it was created in order to trap nabu who once served alongside thoth for reasons not revealed 64 acting as a respository of magical energy the helm was constructed using the fictitious metal known as nth metal granting it mystical properties as well as some anti magic properties against those of magical origin 68 bearing the helm allows for magical capabilitiy spell casting and grant its users numerous powers flight healing and the manipulation of the natural elements wind earth water fire and lightning 69 67 the helm also contains a vast library of spells in which the user can draw from 61 possesses the power to trap entities within its separate world 70 and is both durable and capable of regenerating from damage 71 72 however the helm of fate is not completely impervious as powerful entities i e arion brimstone have shown the ability to damage the helm itself enough to require regeneration showcasing a vulnerability to powerful forms of magic and applications from the firestorm matrix 72 71 the helm can also be overload with magical power rendering much of its power inert this took place during the a costly trick of magic storyline when nabu and nelson sacrificed themselves to creating a spell powerful enough to injure upside down man leaving khalid s incarnation of doctor fate unable to call upon its powers 65 amulet of anubis edit the amulet of anubis sometimes called the amulet of nabu or the amulet of thoth is an amulet that was once bestowed to anubis s most devout follower being created by the death god himself the amulet itself is automatically granted to those who bear the helm of fate bestowed to them alongside the magical cloak the amulet affords several abilities including resistance to psychic astral probing allows for mind control and bolsters a user s magical power 73 while seldomly used by doctor fate himself the amulet also allows for the wearer to call upon the decease spirits allowing him to commune with spirits 74 as well as houses its own universe separate from the main universe allowing the wearer to hide their existence or to trap powerful entities within the amulet s history was revised several times in one story the amulet of anubis was a powerful artifact forged by the lords of order at the dawn of time being so powerful the lords of chaos formerly sought the artifact themselves eventually it came into nabu s possession to be granted to his chosen agent 75 other artifacts edit cloak of destiny a magical cloak with mystic properities the cloak is both fireproof 76 and highly resistant towards some forms of magic in the dc universe jared stevens notably used it to suppress the chaos magic that infected his arm 77 orb of nabu an orb like device used by doctor fate in order to search for unknown threats functioning similarly to a scrying glass despite its naming and doctor fate s association with magic it is one of the few devices he uses not explicitly magic the crystals that make up the orb are considered radio sensitive and react to his brain when in use though technological in nature doctor fate often uses it and his magic in order to discern what is being hidden from them 78 globes of power magically constructed globes used by the inza cramer incarnation of doctor fate created as a method of helping others without needing to directly intervene with other citizens during her tenure in new york the globes are powered by doctor fate s magic and act in a similar manner to ai able to perform simple magical fixes or alert her to threats requiring her attention 79 staff of power a mystical staff gifted to khalid nassour s incarnation of doctor fate by thoth powered by the blood of a pharaoh it allows for energy projection related powers only the khalid nassour version of doctor fate can use it due to his pharaoh lineage 64 tower of fate edit the tower of fate also called the fortress of fate is the magical dwelling bestowed to bearers of the doctor fate mantle the tower acts as a nexus point of magic and reality on earth it has no doors or windows being only accessible by magic the inside of the tower appears as a twisted maze of stairways and hallways in which the laws of physics do not apply 69 the tower holds a large collection of arcane texts within its personal library including materials saved from the great library of alexandria prior to its burning in addition the tower itself possess mystical defenses including once having a protector in the form of typhon a lord of chaos who was an enemy of doctor fate and later protectred the tower from intruders 80 patrons edit throughout the character s history several beings have acted as doctor fate s patron granting the character formidable powers name description lords of order nabu the guiding force and primary patron of most incarnations of doctor fate nabu is a mesopotamian deity one of the lords of order and mentor of several incarnations of doctor fate nabu s relationship with his doctor fate hosts is characterized differently between each incarnations having been depicted as an overbearing figure whose dedication to his goal makes him willing to supplanting the will of his hosts in some depictions he is callous and in others comes to feel regret for it he has also been depicted as an insightful but cryptic and vague mentor while inhabiting the helm of fate nabu s patronage allows for the bearer to have potential access to all of his knowledge magical energy and power and can assist his bearers with his insight and thoughts with his role having been once compared to an ai however this leaves a host vulnerable to nabu who can also usurp control of his bearer s will and body by force shat ru shat ru s patronage allowed kent nelson to regain a connection to the lords of order in a similar method to witchcraft through the use of familiars granting him magical powers and the ability to cast spells comparable to his time as doctor fate under nabu s patron unlike his prior patronage with nabu shat ru s patronage is connected to a makeshift half helmet kent created earlier in his superhero career and lacks the inherent knowledge granted to him through the helmet of fate 81 egyptian deities thoth in the new 52 continuity the helmet of fate s origin changed during the 2015 doctor fate series renamed the helmet of thoth it s powers originating from the egyptian god thoth with nabu acting as the helmet s guiding intelligence spirit due to having once served as thoth s servant in his lifetime unlike other patrons thoth s power was represented solely through the helm and did not require him within the helm to bestow his power 64 later accounts of the helm of fate s history conflicts with earlier statements attributing the powers of the helm back to nabu during the series run thoth s patronage to the helm allowed for specific powers not previously attributed to other depictions of the helm such as native control over the elements wind earth fire water electricity and healing abilities like other iterations of the helmet prior thoth s patron also similarly granted a level of enhanced intellgience and spell casting 64 hauhet some time after the helmet of fate having been damaged during a battle with the entity referred to as the upside down man the helmet of fate lost much of its power for a time although it mysteriously gained newer abilities it is revealed later by wonder woman that the egyptian goddess hauhet currently inhabited the helm in some manner and has since been sending messages to the bearerer khalid nassour 82 due to her divine sphere of influence within space and time the helm of fate is capable of seeing through multiple timelines although much of its abilities is shown in a damage state costing some of the bearer s sight to see into the future 82 the future state event showcases the helm s repaired power with hauhet as its patron allowing the bearer to see both different timelines and experience them individually without costing the bearer s sight 66 lords of chaos chaos inza cramer s version of doctor fate was later revealed to be powered by a lord of chaos simply known as chaos chaos would claim that his influence over inza was subtle and allowed free will due to believing the evil she fought being an opponent to the lord of chaos s objectives inherently along with amusement over the confusion of the lords of chaos fighting evil 79 with chaos s patronage he allows his agent to practice chaos magic allowing them to perform magical feats powered by imagination 79 although later establishment of chaos magic refer to this form of magic as a form of magic that requires no system sigils chanting etc to perform 50 weaknesses edit despite the character s portrayal of powers doctor fate has several weaknesses dependent on the incarnation removal the helm of fate on doctor fate can remove their powers or limit their abilities severely 61 several incarnations of doctor fate suffer from this weakness including both the original kent nelson whom can only cast a limited amount of spells alone and possess no power to channel magic without a lord of order patron 83 and his grand nephew kent v nelson 61 due to the rules of magic doctor fate is unable to cast counter spells against himself to nullify another spell after they ve been cast the character only able to use his powers to protect him from the effects of whatever spell has been cast afterwards this limitation is present on kent nelson s incarnation of doctor fate 25 84 85 the kent nelson incarnation of doctor fate has also fallen victim to gas attacks and lack of oxygen without magical protections divine sources can also disrupt the abilities bestowed to doctor fate s

series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water for other uses see tsunami disambiguation and tidal wave the 2004 indian ocean tsunami at ao nang krabi province thailand 3d tsunami animation a tsunami t suːˈnɑːmi t sʊˈ t soo nah mee t suu 1 2 3 4 from japanese 津波 lit harbour wave 5 pronounced tsɯnami is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water generally in an ocean or a large lake earthquakes volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions including detonations landslides glacier calvings meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami 6 unlike normal ocean waves which are generated by wind or tides which are in turn generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water from a large event tsunami waves do not resemble normal undersea currents or sea waves because their wavelength is far longer 7 rather than appearing as a breaking wave a tsunami may instead initially resemble a rapidly rising tide 8 for this reason it is often referred to as a tidal wave 9 although this usage is not favoured by the scientific community because it might give the false impression of a causal relationship between tides and tsunamis 10 tsunamis generally consist of a series of waves with periods ranging from minutes to hours arriving in a so called wave train 11 wave heights of tens of metres can be generated by large events although the impact of tsunamis is limited to coastal areas their destructive power can be enormous and they can affect entire ocean basins the 2004 indian ocean tsunami was among the deadliest natural disasters in human history with at least 230 000 people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the indian ocean the ancient greek historian thucydides suggested in his 5th century bc history of the peloponnesian war that tsunamis were related to submarine earthquakes 12 13 but the understanding of tsunamis remained slim until the 20th century and much remains unknown major areas of current research include determining why some large earthquakes do not generate tsunamis while other smaller ones do this ongoing research is designed to help accurately forecast the passage of tsunamis across oceans as well as how tsunami waves

term tsunami is a borrowing from the japanese tsunami 津波 meaning harbour wave for the plural one can either follow ordinary english practice and add an s or use an invariable plural as in the japanese 14 some english speakers alter the word s initial ts to an s by dropping the t since english does not natively permit ts at the beginning of words though the original japanese pronunciation is ts tidal wave tsunami aftermath in aceh indonesia december 2004 tsunamis are sometimes referred to as tidal waves 15 this once popular term derives from the most common appearance of a tsunami which is that of an extraordinarily high tidal bore tsunamis and tides both produce waves of water that move inland but in the case of a tsunami the inland movement of water may be much greater giving the impression of an incredibly high and forceful tide in recent years the term tidal wave has fallen out of favour especially in the scientific community because the causes of tsunamis have nothing to do with those of tides which are produced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun rather than the displacement of water although the meanings of tidal include resembling 16 or having the form or character of 17 tides use of the term tidal wave is discouraged by geologists and oceanographers a 1969 episode of the tv crime show hawaii five o entitled forty feet high and it kills used the terms tsunami and tidal wave interchangeably 18 seismic sea wave the term seismic sea wave is also used to refer to the phenomenon because the waves most often are generated by seismic activity such as earthquakes 19 prior to the rise of the use of the term tsunami in english scientists generally encouraged the use of the term seismic sea wave rather than tidal wave however like tsunami seismic sea wave is not a completely accurate term as forces other than earthquakes including underwater landslides volcanic eruptions underwater explosions land or ice slumping into the ocean meteorite impacts and the weather when the atmospheric pressure changes very rapidly can generate such waves by displacing water 20 21 history see also list of tsunamis lisbon earthquake and tsunami in november 1755 while japan may have the longest recorded history of tsunamis the sheer destruction caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami event mark it as the most devastating of its kind in modern times killing around 230 000 people 22 the sumatran region is also accustomed to tsunamis with earthquakes of varying magnitudes regularly occurring off the coast of the island 23 tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the mediterranean sea and parts of europe of historical and current with regard to risk assumptions importance are the 1755 lisbon earthquake and tsunami which was caused by the azores gibraltar transform fault the 1783 calabrian earthquakes each causing several tens of thousands of deaths and the 1908 messina earthquake and tsunami the tsunami claimed more than 123 000 lives in sicily and calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern europe the storegga slide in the norwegian sea and some examples of tsunamis affecting the british isles refer to landslide and meteotsunamis predominantly and less to earthquake induced waves as early as 426 bc the greek historian thucydides inquired in his book history of the peloponnesian war about the causes of tsunami and was the first to argue that ocean earthquakes must be the cause 12 13 the oldest human record of a tsunami dates back to 479 bc in the greek colony of potidaea thought to be triggered by an earthquake the tsunami may have saved the colony from an invasion by the achaemenid empire 13 the cause in my opinion of this phenomenon must be sought in the earthquake at the point where its shock has been the most violent the sea is driven back and suddenly recoiling with redoubled force causes the inundation without an earthquake i do not see how such an accident could happen 24 the roman historian ammianus marcellinus res gestae 26 10 15 19 described the typical sequence of a tsunami including an incipient earthquake the sudden retreat of the sea and a following gigantic wave after the 365 ad tsunami devastated alexandria 25 26 causes the principal generation mechanism of a tsunami is the displacement of a substantial volume of water or perturbation of the sea 27 this displacement of water is usually caused by earthquakes 28 29 30 but can also be attributed to landslides volcanic eruptions glacier calvings or more rarely by meteorites and nuclear tests 31 32 however the possibility of a meteorite causing a tsunami is debated 33 seismicity tsunamis can be generated when the sea floor abruptly deforms and vertically displaces the overlying water tectonic earthquakes are a particular kind of earthquake that are associated with the earth s crustal deformation when these earthquakes occur beneath the sea the water above the deformed area is displaced from its equilibrium position 34 more specifically a tsunami can be generated when thrust faults associated with convergent or destructive plate boundaries move abruptly resulting in water displacement owing to the vertical component of movement involved movement on normal extensional faults can also cause displacement of the seabed but only the largest of such events typically related to flexure in the outer trench swell cause enough displacement to give rise to a significant tsunami such as the 1977 sumba and 1933 sanriku events 35 36 drawing of tectonic plate boundary before earthquake over riding plate bulges under strain causing tectonic uplift plate slips causing subsidence and releasing energy into water the energy released produces tsunami waves tsunamis have a small wave height offshore and a very long wavelength often hundreds of kilometres long whereas normal ocean waves have a wavelength of only 30 or 40 metres 37 which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea forming only a slight swell usually about 300 millimetres 12 in above the normal sea surface they grow in height when they reach shallower water in a wave shoaling process described below a tsunami can occur in any tidal state and even at low tide can still inundate coastal areas on april 1 1946 the 8 6 mw aleutian islands earthquake occurred with a maximum mercalli intensity of vi strong it generated a tsunami which inundated hilo on the island of hawaii with a 14 metre high 46 ft surge between 165 and 173 were killed the area where the earthquake occurred is where the pacific ocean floor is subducting or being pushed downwards under alaska examples of tsunamis originating at locations away from convergent boundaries include storegga about 8 000 years ago grand banks in 1929 and papua new guinea in 1998 tappin 2001 the grand banks and papua new guinea tsunamis came from earthquakes which destabilised sediments causing them to flow into the ocean and generate a tsunami they dissipated before travelling transoceanic distances the cause of the storegga sediment failure is unknown possibilities include an overloading of the sediments an earthquake or a release of gas hydrates methane etc the 1960 valdivia earthquake mw 9 5 1964 alaska earthquake mw 9 2 2004 indian ocean earthquake mw 9 2 and 2011 tōhoku earthquake mw9 0 are recent examples of powerful megathrust earthquakes that generated tsunamis known as teletsunamis that can cross entire oceans smaller mw 4 2 earthquakes in japan can trigger tsunamis called local and regional tsunamis that can devastate stretches of coastline but can do so in only a few minutes at a time landslides the tauredunum event was a large tsunami on lake geneva in 563 ce caused by sedimentary deposits destabilized by a landslide in the 1950s it was discovered that tsunamis larger than had previously been believed possible can be caused by giant submarine landslides these large volumes of rapidly displaced water transfer energy at a faster rate than the water can absorb their existence was confirmed in 1958 when a giant landslide in lituya bay alaska caused the highest wave ever recorded which had a height of 524 metres 1 719 ft 38 the wave did not travel far as it struck land almost immediately the wave struck three boats each with two people aboard anchored in the bay one boat rode out the wave but the wave sank the other two killing both people aboard one of them 39 40 41 another landslide tsunami event occurred in 1963 when a massive landslide from monte toc entered the reservoir behind the vajont dam in italy the resulting wave surged over the 262 metre 860 ft high dam by 250 metres 820 ft and destroyed several towns around 2 000 people died 42 43 scientists named these waves megatsunamis some geologists claim that large landslides from volcanic islands e g cumbre vieja on la palma cumbre vieja tsunami hazard in the canary islands may be able to generate megatsunamis that can cross oceans but this is disputed by many others in general landslides generate displacements mainly in the shallower parts of the coastline and there is conjecture about the nature of large landslides that enter the water this has been shown to subsequently affect water in enclosed bays and lakes but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history susceptible locations are believed to be the big island of hawaii fogo in the cape verde islands la reunion in the indian ocean and cumbre vieja on the island of la palma in the canary islands along with other volcanic ocean islands this is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing however there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are 44 volcanic eruptions main article volcanic tsunami other than by landslides or sector collapse volcanoes may be able to generate waves by pyroclastic flow submergence caldera collapse or underwater explosions 45 tsunamis have been triggered by a number of volcanic eruptions including the 1883 eruption of krakatoa and the 2022 hunga tonga hunga ha apai eruption over 20 of all fatalities caused by volcanism during the past 250 years are estimated to have been caused by volcanogenic tsunamis 46 debate has persisted over the origins and source mechanisms of these types of tsunamis such as those generated by krakatoa in 1883 46 and they remain lesser understood than their seismic relatives this poses a large problem of awareness and preparedness as exemplified by the eruption and collapse of anak krakatoa in 2018 which killed 426 and injured thousands when no warning was available it is still regarded that lateral landslides and ocean entering pyroclastic currents are most likely to generate the largest and most hazardous waves from volcanism 47 however field investigation of the tongan event as well as developments in numerical modelling methods currently aim to expand the understanding of the other source mechanisms 48 49 meteorological main article meteotsunami some meteorological conditions especially rapid changes in barometric pressure as seen with the passing of a front can displace bodies of water enough to cause trains of waves with wavelengths these are comparable to seismic tsunamis but usually with lower energies essentially they are dynamically equivalent to seismic tsunamis the only differences being 1 that meteotsunamis lack the transoceanic reach of significant seismic tsunamis and 2 that the force that displaces the water is sustained over some length of time such that meteotsunamis cannot be modelled as having been caused instantaneously in spite of their lower energies on shorelines where they can be amplified by resonance they are sometimes powerful enough to cause localised damage and potential for loss of life they have been documented in many places including the great lakes the aegean sea the english channel and the balearic islands where they are common enough to have a local name rissaga in sicily they are called marubbio and in nagasaki bay they are called abiki some examples of destructive meteotsunamis include 31 march 1979 at nagasaki and 15 june 2006 at menorca the latter causing damage in the tens of millions of euros 50 meteotsunamis should not be confused with storm surges which are local increases in sea level associated with the low barometric pressure of passing tropical cyclones nor should they be confused with setup the temporary local raising of sea level caused by strong on shore winds storm surges and setup are also dangerous causes of coastal flooding in severe weather but their dynamics are completely unrelated to tsunami waves 50 they are unable to propagate beyond their sources as waves do man made or triggered tsunamis see also tsunami bomb there have been studies of the potential of the induction of and at least one actual attempt to create tsunami waves as a tectonic weapon in world war ii the new zealand military forces initiated project seal which attempted to create small tsunamis with explosives in the area of today s shakespear regional park the attempt failed 51 there has been considerable speculation on the possibility of using nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis near an enemy coastline even during world war ii consideration of the idea using conventional explosives was explored nuclear testing in the pacific proving ground by the united states seemed to generate poor results operation crossroads fired two 20 kilotonnes of tnt 84 tj bombs one in the air and one underwater above and below the shallow 50 m 160 ft waters of the bikini atoll lagoon fired about 6 km 3 7 mi from the nearest island the waves there were no higher than 3 4 m 9 8 13 1 ft upon reaching the shoreline other underwater tests mainly hardtack i wahoo deep water and hardtack i umbrella shallow water confirmed the results analysis of the effects of shallow and deep underwater explosions indicate that the energy of the explosions does not easily generate the kind of deep all ocean waveforms which are tsunamis most of the energy creates steam causes vertical fountains above the water and creates compressional waveforms 52 tsunamis are hallmarked by permanent large vertical displacements of very large volumes of water which do not occur in explosions characteristics when the wave enters shallow water it slows down and its amplitude height increases the wave further slows and amplifies as it hits land only the largest waves crest tsunamis are caused by earthquakes landslides volcanic explosions glacier calvings and bolides they cause damage by two mechanisms the smashing force of a wall of water travelling at high speed and the destructive power of a large volume of water draining off the land and carrying a large amount of debris with it even with waves that do not appear to be large while everyday wind waves have a wavelength from crest to crest of about 100 metres 330 ft and a height of roughly 2 metres 6 6 ft a tsunami in the deep ocean has a much larger wavelength of up to 200 kilometres 120 mi such a wave travels at well over 800 kilometres per hour 500 mph but owing to the enormous wavelength the wave oscillation at any given point takes 20 or 30 minutes to complete a cycle and has an amplitude of only about 1 metre 3 3 ft 53 this makes tsunamis difficult to detect over deep water where ships are unable to feel their passage the velocity of a tsunami can be calculated by obtaining the square root of the depth of the water in metres multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity approximated to 10 m s2 for example if the pacific ocean is considered to have a depth of 5000 metres the velocity of a tsunami would be 5000 10 50000 224 metres per second 730 ft s which equates to a speed of about 806 kilometres per hour 501 mph this is the formula used for calculating the velocity of shallow water waves even the deep ocean is shallow in this sense because a tsunami wave is so long horizontally from crest to crest by comparison the reason for the japanese name harbour wave is that sometimes a village s fishermen would sail out and encounter no unusual waves while out at sea fishing and come back to land to find their village devastated by a huge wave as the tsunami approaches the coast and the waters become shallow wave shoaling compresses the wave and its speed decreases below 80 kilometres per hour 50 mph its wavelength diminishes to less than 20 kilometres 12 mi and its amplitude grows enormously in accord with green s law since the wave still has the same very long period the tsunami may take minutes to reach full height except for the very largest tsunamis the approaching wave does not break but rather appears like a fast moving tidal bore 54 open bays and coastlines adjacent to very deep water may shape the tsunami further into a step like wave with a steep breaking front when the tsunami s wave peak reaches the shore the resulting temporary rise in sea level is termed run up run up is measured in metres above a reference sea level 54 a large tsunami may feature multiple waves arriving over a period of hours with significant time between the wave crests the first wave to reach the shore may not have the highest run up 55 about 80 of tsunamis occur in the pacific ocean but they are possible wherever there are large bodies of water including lakes however tsunami interactions with shorelines and the seafloor topography are extremely complex which leaves some countries more vulnerable than others for example the pacific coasts of the united states and mexico lie adjacent to each other but the united states has recorded ten tsunamis in the region since 1788 while mexico has recorded twenty five since 1732 56 57 similarly japan has had more than a hundred tsunamis in recorded history while the neighboring island of taiwan has registered only two in 1781 and 1867 58 59 drawback an illustration of the rhythmic drawback of surface water associated with a wave it follows that a very large drawback may herald the arrival of a very large wave all waves have a positive and negative peak that is a ridge and a trough in the case of a propagating wave like a tsunami either may be the first to arrive if the first part to arrive at the shore is the ridge a massive breaking wave or sudden flooding will be the first effect noticed on land however if the first part to arrive is a trough a drawback will occur as the shoreline recedes dramatically exposing normally submerged areas the drawback can exceed hundreds of metres and people unaware of the danger sometimes remain near the shore to satisfy their curiosity or to collect fish from the exposed seabed a typical wave period for a damaging tsunami is about twelve minutes thus the sea recedes in the drawback phase with areas well below sea level exposed after three minutes for the next six minutes the wave trough builds into a ridge which may flood the coast and destruction ensues during the next six minutes the wave changes from a ridge to a trough and the flood waters recede in a second drawback victims and debris may be swept into the ocean the process repeats with succeeding waves scales of intensity and magnitude as with earthquakes several attempts have been made to set up scales of tsunami intensity or magnitude to allow comparison between different events 60 intensity scales the first scales used routinely to measure the intensity of tsunamis were the sieberg ambraseys scale 1962 used in the mediterranean sea and the imamura iida intensity scale 1963 used in the pacific ocean the latter scale was modified by soloviev 1972 who calculated the tsunami intensity i according to the formula i 1 2 log 2 h a v displaystyle mathit i frac 1 2 log _ 2 mathit h _ av where h a v displaystyle mathit h _ av is the tsunami height averaged along the nearest coastline with the tsunami height defined as the rise of the water level above the normal tidal level at the time of occurrence of the tsunami 61 this scale known as the soloviev imamura tsunami intensity scale is used in the global tsunami catalogues compiled by the ngdc noaa 62 and the novosibirsk tsunami laboratory as the main parameter for the size of the tsunami this formula yields i 2 for h a v displaystyle mathit h _ av 2 8 metres i 3 for h a v displaystyle mathit h _ av 5 5 metres i 4 for h a v displaystyle mathit h _ av 11 metres i 5 for h a v displaystyle mathit h _ av 22 5 metres etc in 2013 following the intensively studied tsunamis in 2004 and 2011 a new 12 point scale was proposed the integrated tsunami intensity scale itis 2012 intended to match as closely as possible to the modified esi2007 and ems earthquake intensity scales 63 64 magnitude scales the first scale that genuinely calculated a magnitude for a tsunami rather than an intensity at a particular location was the ml scale proposed by murty loomis based on the potential energy 60 difficulties in calculating the potential energy of the tsunami mean that this scale is rarely used abe introduced the tsunami magnitude scale m t displaystyle mathit m _ t calculated from m t a log h b log r d displaystyle mathit m _ t a log h b log r mathit d where h is the maximum tsunami wave amplitude in m measured by a tide gauge at a distance r from the epicentre a b and d are constants used to make the mt scale match as closely as possible with the moment magnitude scale 65 tsunami heights diagram showing several measures to describe a tsunami size including height inundation and run up several terms are used to describe the different characteristics of tsunami in terms of their height 66 67 68 69 amplitude wave height or tsunami height refers to the height of a tsunami relative to the normal sea level at the time of the tsunami which may be tidal high water or low water it is different from the crest to trough height which is commonly used to measure other type of wave height 70 run up height or inundation height the height reached by a tsunami on the ground above sea level maximum run up height refers to the maximum height reached by water above sea level which is sometimes reported as the maximum height reached by a tsunami flow depth refers to the height of tsunami above ground regardless of the height of the location or sea level maximum water level maximum height above sea level as seen from trace or water mark different from maximum run up height in the sense that they are not necessarily water marks at inundation line limit warnings and predictions see also tsunami warning system calculated travel time map for the 1964 alaska tsunami in hours drawbacks can serve as a brief warning people who observe drawback many survivors report an accompanying sucking sound can survive only if they immediately run for high ground or seek the upper floors of nearby buildings in 2004 ten year old tilly smith of surrey england was on maikhao beach in phuket thailand with her parents and sister and having learned about tsunamis recently in school told her family that a tsunami might be imminent her parents warned others minutes before the wave arrived saving dozens of lives she credited her geography teacher andrew kearney in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami drawback was not reported on the african coast or any other east facing coasts that it reached this was because the initial wave moved downwards on the eastern side of the megathrust and upwards on the western side the western pulse hit coastal africa and other western areas a tsunami cannot be precisely predicted even if the magnitude and location of an earthquake is known geologists oceanographers and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors may or may not issue a tsunami warning however there are some warning signs of an impending tsunami and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives one of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors attached to buoys which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column regions with a high tsunami risk typically use tsunami warning systems to warn the population before the wave reaches land on the west coast of the united states which is prone to tsunamis from the pacific ocean warning signs indicate evacuation routes in japan the populace is well educated about earthquakes and tsunamis and along japanese shorelines tsunami warning signs remind people of the natural hazards along with a network of warning sirens typically at the top of the cliffs of surrounding hills 71 the pacific tsunami warning system is based in honolulu hawaiʻi it monitors pacific ocean seismic activity a sufficiently large earthquake magnitude and other information triggers a tsunami warning while the subduction zones around the pacific are seismically active not all earthquakes generate a tsunami computers assist in analysing the tsunami risk of every earthquake that occurs in the pacific ocean and the adjoining land masses tsunami hazard sign at bamfield british columbia a tsunami warning sign in kamakura japan a tsunami hazard sign spanish english in iquique chile tsunami evacuation route signage along u s

disaster mitigation committee a tsunami warning system is being installed in the indian ocean one of the deep water buoys used in the dart tsunami warning system computer models can predict tsunami arrival usually within minutes of the arrival time bottom pressure sensors can relay information in real time based on these pressure readings and other seismic information and the seafloor s shape bathymetry and coastal topography the models estimate the amplitude and surge height of the approaching tsunami all pacific rim countries collaborate in the tsunami warning system and most regularly practise evacuation and other procedures in japan such preparation is mandatory for government local authorities emergency services and the population along the united states west coast in addition to sirens warnings are sent on television and radio via the national weather service using the emergency alert system possible animal reaction further information infrasound animal reaction some zoologists hypothesise that some animal species have an ability to sense subsonic rayleigh waves from an earthquake or a tsunami if correct monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes and tsunamis however the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted there are unsubstantiated claims about the lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground while many other animals in the same areas drowned the phenomenon was also noted by media sources in sri lanka in the 2004 indian ocean earthquake 72 73 it is possible that certain animals e g elephants may have heard the sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast the elephants reaction was to move away from the approaching noise by contrast some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result mitigation see also seawall a seawall at tsu mie prefecture in japan in some tsunami prone countries earthquake engineering measures have been taken to reduce the damage caused onshore japan where tsunami science and response measures first began following a disaster in 1896 has produced ever more elaborate countermeasures and response plans 74 the country has built many tsunami walls of up to 12 metres 39 ft high to protect populated coastal areas other localities have built floodgates of up to 15 5 metres 51 ft high and channels to redirect the water from an incoming tsunami however their effectiveness has been questioned as tsunamis often overtop the barriers the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster was directly triggered by the 2011 tōhoku earthquake and tsunami when waves exceeded the height of the plant s sea wall 75 iwate prefecture which is an area at high risk from tsunami had tsunami barriers walls taro sea wall totalling 25 kilometres 16 mi long at coastal towns the 2011 tsunami toppled more than 50 of the walls and caused catastrophic damage 76 the okushiri hokkaidō tsunami which struck okushiri island of hokkaidō within two to five minutes of the earthquake on july 12 1993 created waves as much as 30 metres 100 ft tall as high as a 10 storey building the port town of aonae was completely surrounded by a tsunami wall but the waves washed right over the wall and destroyed all the wood framed structures in the area the wall may have succeeded in slowing down and moderating the height of the tsunami but it did not prevent major

publication history edit golden age edit created by writer gardner fox and artist dennis neville shiera sanders first appeared in flash comics 1 january 1940 in the same 12 page story in which fox and neville introduced hawkman 1 shiera first appears as hawkgirl in all star comics 5 july 1941 in a costume created by sheldon moldoff 2 based on neville s hawkman costume silver age edit main article hawkwoman with the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s the hawkman feature ended in the last issue of flash comics in 1949 in 1956 dc comics resurrected the flash by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory following the success of the new flash dc comics revamped hawkman in a similar fashion with the brave and the bold 34 in 1961 the silver age versions of hawkman and hawkgirl became married thanagarian police officers from the planet thanagar who come to earth in order to study police techniques silver age hawkgirl is introduced as shayera hol phonetically identical to shiera hall who appears in costume as of her first appearance although silver age hawkman joins the justice league in justice league of america 31 in 1964 silver age hawkgirl was not offered membership because justice league rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time in 1981 silver age hawkgirl changed her name to hawkwoman in the hawkman backup feature of world s finest comics 274 with the establishment of dc s multiverse system the golden age hawkgirl was said to have lived on earth two and the silver age hawkgirl on earth one post crisis and one year later edit following the events of dc s miniseries crisis on infinite earths the histories of earth one two four s and x were merged into one single earth with a consistent past present and future as a result both the golden age and the silver age versions of hawkman and hawkgirl live on the same earth shortly after crisis on infinite earths dc decided that having the justice society on the same earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team including golden age hawkman and hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the last days of the justice society one shot the justice society were trapped in another dimension limbo where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent ragnarök from occurring on the earth initially the silver age hawkman and hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after crisis on infinite earths however dc reversed this decision and rebooted hawkman continuity after the success of the hawkworld miniseries originally hawkworld was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of hawkman and hawkwoman but after the series became a success dc comics made hawkworld an ongoing series set in the present with both heroes only recently appearing on earth after the events in the invasion miniseries resulting in a complete reboot of hawkman continuity several continuity errors regarding hawkman and hawkgirl s justice league appearances then needed to be fixed including their appearance in the invasion miniseries all previous appearances by the silver age hawkgirl in the justice league were explained by the golden age hawkgirl taking the silver age hawkgirl s place however hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre hawkworld justice league adventures during the time golden age hawkgirl was trapped in limbo to explain this continuity error a new hawkwoman sharon parker was created and retconned into the justice league during the time golden age hawkgirl was in limbo after the hawkworld reboot hawkgirl hawkwoman was now shayera thal and not married to katar hol instead merely his police partner in post hawkworld continuity shayera adopts the name hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name hawkgirl the golden age hawkgirl is eventually returned from limbo but during the zero hour miniseries she is merged with katar hol and golden age hawkman into a new persona a new hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the jsa monthly title the new hawkgirl is kendra saunders granddaughter of the golden age hawkgirl s cousin speed saunders hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly jsa series and later in the hawkman monthly in 2006 the ongoing hawkman monthly series was retitled hawkgirl starting with issue 50 as part of the one year later jump forward kendra replaced hawkman as the lead character the hawkgirl comic book series was finished with issue 66 fictional character biographies edit shiera sanders hall edit the golden age hawkgirl was shiera sanders hall the reincarnation of the egyptian princess chay ara and partner of carter hall the golden age hawkman shayera hol edit main article shayera hol kendra saunders

golden age hawkgirl entered it making kendra a walk in her grandfather former oss agent and globe trotting adventurer speed saunders recognized this in part due to a change in eye color and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the new hawkgirl powers and abilities edit hawkgirl owes her powers to a belt of nth metal a substance native to the planet thanagar once home of another pair of hawk heroes katar hol and hawkwoman the metal is psycho reactive responding to its bearer s thoughts and in its base form has a number of electromagnetic gravitational properties to the hawks it grants the power of flight superhuman strength super acute vision and an enhanced healing regeneration ability additionally she displays advanced hand to hand combat skills like hawkman she retains the knowledge of several lifetimes worth of fighting her preferred weapons are a spear or mace but she has also been depicted using swords axes warhammers shields and other melee weapons she possesses shooting skills from her times as the gunfighter cinnamon in addition the nth metal knife which murdered hawkgirl in her original incarnation as chay ara had an unusual effect upon her soul and that of her lover khufu hawkman the pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries while not a superhuman power per se this propensity for reincarnation has allowed hawkgirl to cheat death and return to active duty in her current incarnation like all modern thanagarians shayera hol has a pair of wings growing from her back which allows her to fly as a thanagarian she has considerable physical strength endurance and durability as a former member of the thanagarian military she had extensive training in tactics military science and personal combat skills additionally her focus in espionage can make her a difficult opponent to track and provides her with an advantage when tracking villains hawkgirl carries a mace made of nth metal which can generate electric currents and repel magical energies her mace is highly effective against magic as shown when hawkgirl defeated doctor fate a powerful magician of the dc universe hawkgirl is skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately she has creatively used the mace as a shield to deflect incoming projectiles as well as a makeshift defibrillator unit hawkgirl is fluent in many earth languages through the use of the absorbascon her unique thanagarian physiology also enables her to verbally communicate with birds 3 the nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes it also has the property of radiating heat which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates 4 recently kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing strength vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing nth metal she speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance it remains to be seen if she still possesses these abilities now that she is shiera hall once again 5 other versions edit flashpoint edit in the alternate timeline of the flashpoint event hawkgirl joined with the amazons furies 6 later hawkgirl is seen aiding artemis in her attempt to kill the resistance movement member lois lane 7 although lois is rescued by resistance member penny black using the smoke

xolotl is depicted as a companion of the setting sun 4 he is pictured with a knife in his mouth a symbol of death 5 xolotl was the sinister god of monstrosities who wears the spirally twisted wind jewel and the ear ornaments of quetzalcoatl 6 his job was to protect the sun from the dangers of the underworld as a double of quetzalcoatl he carries his conch like ehecailacacozcatl or wind jewel

from this sacrifice and wept so much his eyes fell out of their sockets 8 according to the creation recounted in the florentine codex after the fifth sun was initially created it did not move ehecatl god of wind consequently began slaying all other gods to induce the newly created sun into movement xolotl however was unwilling to die in order to give movement to the new sun xolotl transformed

psychopomp xolotl would guide the dead on their journey to mictlan the afterlife in myths his two spirit animal forms are the xoloitzcuintli dog and the water salamander species known as the axolotl 11 xolos served as companions to the aztecs in this life and also in the after life as many dog remains and dog sculptures have been found in aztec burials including some at the main temple in tenochtitlan dogs were often subject to ritual sacrifice so that they could accompany their master on his voyage through mictlan the underworld 12 their main duty was to help their owners cross a deep river it is possible that dog sculptures also found in burials were also intended to help people on this journey xoloitzcuintli is the official name of the mexican hairless dog also known as perro pelón mexicano in mexican spanish a pre columbian canine breed from mesoamerica dating back to over 3500 years ago 13 this is one of many native dog breeds in the americas and it is often confused with the peruvian hairless dog the name xoloitzcuintli references xolotl because this dog s mission was to accompany the souls of the dead in their journey into eternity the name axolotl comes from nahuatl the aztec language one translation of the name connects the axolotl to xolotl the most common translation is water dog atl for water and xolotl for dog 14 in the aztec calendar the ruler of the day itzcuintli dog is mictlantecuhtli the god of death and lord of mictlan the afterlife 15 origin edit codex borgia p 38 xolotl with xiuhcoatl fire serpent xolotl is sometimes depicted carrying a torch in the surviving maya codices which reference the maya tradition that the dog brought fire to mankind 16 in the mayan codices the dog is conspicuously associated with the god of death storm and lightning 17 xolotl appears to have affinities with the zapotec and maya lightning dog and may represent the lightning which descends from the thundercloud the flash the reflection of which arouses the misconceived belief that lightning is double and leads them to suppose a connection between lightning and twins 18 xolotl originated in the southern regions and may represent fire rushing down from the heavens or light flaming up in the heavens 19 xolotl was originally the name for lightning beast of the maya tribe often taking the form of a dog 8 the dog plays an important role in maya manuscripts he is the lightning beast who darts from heaven with a torch in his hand 20 xolotl is represented directly as a dog and is distinguished as the deity of air and of the four directions of the wind by quetzalcoatl s breast ornament xolotl is to be considered equivalent to the beast darting from heaven of the maya manuscript 21 the dog is the animal of the dead and therefore of the place of shadows 18 dresden codex dog p 7 dog p 39 dog p 40 ollin and xolotl edit stone sculpture representing the head of the aztec god xolotl an important figure within the rituals surrounding the god quetzalcoatl is xolotl his twin a peculiar god in the form of a dog identifiable by the many wrinkles on the sacred canine and the two rectangular protuberances on its head relating it with the heavenly fire day symbol ollin in codex borgia p 10 eduard seler associates xolotl s portrayal as a dog with the belief that dogs accompany the souls of the dead to mictlan he finds further evidence of the association between xolotl dogs death and mictlan in the fact that mesoamericans viewed twins as unnatural monstrosities and consequently commonly killed one of the two twins shortly after birth seler speculates that xolotl represents the murdered twin who dwells in the darkness of mictlan while quetzalcoatl the precious twin represents the surviving twin who dwells in the light of the sun 9 in manuscripts the setting sun devoured by the earth is opposite xolotl s image 22 quetzalcoatl and xolotl constitute the twin phases of venus as the morning and evening star respectively quetzalcoatl as the morning star acts as the harbinger of the sun s rising rebirth every dawn xolotl as the evening star acts as the harbinger of the sun s setting death every dusk in this way they divide the single life death process of cyclical transformation into its two phases one leading from birth to death the other from death to birth 9 xolotl was the patron of the mesoamerican ballgame some scholars argue the ballgame symbolizes the sun s perilous and uncertain nighttime journey through the underworld 9 xolotl is able to help in the sun s rebirth since he possesses the power to enter and exit the underworld 9 in several of the manuscripts xolotl is depicted striving at this game against other gods for example in the codex mendoza we see him playing with the moon god and can recognize him by the sign ollin which accompanies him and by the gouged out eye in which that symbol ends seler thinks that the root of the name ollin suggested to mexicans the motion of the rubber ball olli and as a consequence ball playing 23 ollin is pulsating oscillating and centering motion change it is typified by bouncing balls pulsating hearts labor contractions earthquakes flapping butterfly wings the undulating motion of weft activities in weaving and the oscillating path of the fifth sun over and under the surface of the earth ollin is the motion change of cyclical completion 24 a jade statue of a skeletal xolotl carrying a solar disc bearing an image of the sun on his back 25 26 called the night traveler succinctly portrays xolotl s role in assisting the sun through the process of death gestation and rebirth xolotl s association with ollin motion change suggests proper completions and gestations must instantiate ollin motion change ollin shaped decomposition and integration i e death promote ollin shaped composition and integration i e rebirth and renewal 9 nanahuatzin and xolotl edit codex borgia p 34 xolotl sacrifices the rain god within the sanctuary of the red temple the sun is finally born against the background of a solid red disk a warrior drills a fire on the chest of a figure lying down from the smoke emerges a red solar deity with the wind jewel immediately to the right the deity is enthroned in the temple he now has canine claws a canine mouth mask the wind jewel and a distended eye that identify him as the red xolotl he also carries the sun on his back 27 codex borgia p 47 a dog xolotl accompanies an anthropomorphic avatar of xolotl 28 a close relationship between xolotl and nanahuatzin exists 29 xolotl is probably identical with nanahuatl nanahuatzin 30 seler characterizes nanahuatzin little pustule covered one who is deformed by syphilis as an aspect of xolotl in his capacity as god of monsters deforming diseases and deformities 9 the syphilitic god nanahuatzin is an avatar of xolotl 31 see also edit dogs in mesoamerican folklore and myth list of death deities nagual black dog folklore codex xolotl king xolotl

published in serial form in space science fiction in 1953 and then as a novel in 1954 anderson had said that he could consider it one of his top five books 1 this is one of many science fiction works written at this time on the theme of heightened intelligence contents 1 plot summary 2 characters 2 1 archie brock 2 2 dr peter corinth 2 3 sheila corinth 2 4 felix mandelbaum 3 reception 4 references 5 external links plot summary edit at the end of the cretaceous period earth moved into an energy damping field in space as long as earth was in this field all conductors became more insulating as a result almost all of the life on earth with neurons died off causing the cretaceous paleogene extinction event the ones that survived passed on their genes for sufficiently capable neurons to deal with the new circumstance now in modern times earth suddenly moves out of the field within weeks all animal life on earth becomes about 5 times as intelligent the novel goes through the triumphs and tribulations of various people and non human animals on earth after this event the book opens with a lyrical description of a rabbit stuck inside a trap becoming able to reason his way out this is a common theme in the book animal traps are based on the idea that the animals cannot reason their way out of them when the animals get the ability to reason they start escaping institutions which seemed to be vital to human society such as a money economy and centralized government disappear in north america while africans with the assistance of now well armed gorillas overcome colonial rule and chinese rebel against the communist government however some of the means by which people cope with the change are inventing new anti scientific religions such as the third ba al or adopting pseudo science as humans develop interstellar travel they discover no other races are as intelligent as they other races developed pre change intelligence and there was no environmental pressure to select for higher intelligence after that characters edit archie brock edit archie brock one of the main characters in the story is mentally disabled when the earth moves out of the field he becomes a genius by pre change standards his character is central to the story halfway through the book he has taken over the farm that he worked on and with the aid of his dog who now understands simple english and some escaped circus animals two chimps and an elephant they successfully run the farm together even though his intelligence has increased fivefold so has everyone else s he is still considered a relative simpleton but has very much come to terms with that in the end when nearly all the humans leave earth he decides to stay behind as leader of a colony of now sentient animals and formerly mentally disabled people dr peter corinth edit physics researcher who spent a brief period at los alamos in wwii he is one of the first to understand the change after the change he experiences an emotional battle to stay loyal to his wife although he has feelings for another woman in his office he later becomes a pilot of the first spaceship able to explore the galaxy as part of that exploration he again crosses into the energy damping field his mind quickly becomes unable to work the complex controls and he must wait for the ship to move back out of the field on its own sheila corinth edit wife of peter corinth she is a housewife before the change the first effect she goes through when the change begins is a philosophical realization that her life as a housewife is better than that of her non conformist friends later on she begins to lose her sanity from having to deal daily with the existential crisis her story is typical of many people in the book who didn t have the intelligence before the change to know how bad their situations were later she goes into her husband s lab to use an electroconvulsive therapy machine there to destroy parts of her brain bringing her iq down to about 150 with which she is more comfortable she leaves peter and in the last scene we see her introduced to archie brock s farm felix mandelbaum edit neighbor of the corinths before the change he is a jewish executive secretary of a local union he is 50 years old and was born on the lower east side of new york later on he becomes executive of the world reception edit some have argued that the book is too short which might have been a result of editor pressure at the time for example thomas m wagner 2 writes the book does feel somewhat rushed as well as heavily edited and i felt there was more anderson was wanting to tell me anderson focuses his plot on a handful of lead characters reviewer groff conklin praised the novel as an original idea brilliantly carried out but faulted its rather fumbling ending 3 p schuyler miller described brain wave as a brilliant idea that somehow doesn t quite come off 4 anthony boucher praised the novel saying that anderson has worked out in wonderfully logical detail the logical consequences of his assumption and advanced his speculations with exciting storytelling and moving characterization 5 leslie flood wrote in new worlds

hypnotized ub president sam tanner and later tanner s nephew les vegas to fill the role a third blackrock an energy construct was created by tanner s command not much later eventually silverstone assumed the mantle of blackrock himself using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight energy blasts and superhuman strength and fought superman several times this rock while a technological artifact has the appearance of a polished gem that is as black as coal it was appropriately dubbed the blackrock the post crisis version was stated in batman superman adventures to be a symbiotic alien life form rather than a creation of dr silverstone its appearance and abilities are approximately the same silverstone is the only pre crisis user of the stone that has been mentioned in post crisis continuity overuse of the blackrock s powers blinded silverstone and left him insane he was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex convict named samuel benjamin who beat silverstone to death with the blackrock and took it for himself despite its power his inexperience with the blackrock led to his defeat and superman took the stone and threw it towards the sun 29 a short time later alexander luthor jr disguised as lex luthor dispatched bizarro to retrieve the blackrock from the sun 30 before passing it on to a south american woman named lucia 31 a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by superman before her intense feelings of hatred towards the man of

it in a crashed spacecraft they intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the pre flashpoint superman had to intervene 34 the post crisis wielders of the blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities all seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance flight and energy projection abilities the blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder dr silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from tv and radio signals samuel benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness lucia s abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain superman s power while the stone had bonded to plastic man he was not shown using its abilities much batman used it in much the same way that lucia did but batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than lucia did jimmy olsen and several other humans were bonded to the blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on earth these people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by lucia etc but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was bradley glenn s armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch blackwing edit blackwing charles charlie bullock is a superhero

held by the capital museum dragons of the five regions directions existed in chinese custom 13 established by the former han period cf origins origins below 13 the same concept couched in dragon king longwang terminology was centuries later 14 the term dragon king being imported from india sanskrit naga raja 15 vis buddhism 9 introduced in the 1st century ad during the later han 16 the five dragon kings which were correlated with the five colors and five directions are attested uniquely in one work among buddhist scriptures sūtra called the foshuo guanding jing 佛說灌頂經 consecration sūtra expounded by the buddha early 4th century c 19 attributed to po srimitra it is a pretended translation or apocryphal sutra post canonical text 17 20 but its influence on later rituals relating to entombment is not dismissable 20 the dragon king cult was most active around the sui tang dynasty according to one scholar 21 but another observes that the cult spread farther afield with the backing of song dynasty monarchs who built dragon king temples or rather taoist shrines 8 and emperor huizong of song 12th century conferred investiture upon them as local kings 22 but the dragon king and other spell incantations came to be discouraged in buddhism within china because they were based on eclectic apocryphal sutras and the emphasis grew for the orthodox sutras 23 or put another way the quinary system based on number 5 was being superseded by the number 8 or number 12 being held more sacred 24 during the tang period the dragon kings were also regarded as guardians that safeguard homes and pacify tombs in conjunction with the worship of lord earth 25 buddhist rainmaking ritual learned tang dynasty china by the concept was transmitted to japan alongside esoteric buddhism 26 and also practiced as rites in onmyōdō during the heian period 27 28 five dragons edit origins the idea of associating the five directions regions wufang 五方 with the five colors is found in confucian classic text 30 the huainanzi 2nd cent bc describes the five colored dragons azure green red white black yellow and their associations chapter 4 terrestrial forms 31 32 33 as well as the placement of sacred beasts in the five directions the four symbols beasts dragon tiger bird tortoise in the four cardinal directions and the yellow dragon 34 35 29 and the luxuriant dew of the spring and autumn

jing 佛說灌頂經 consecration sūtra expounded by the buddha early 4th century attributed to po srimitra 帛尸梨蜜多羅 which purports to be buddhist teachings but in fact incorporates elements of chinese traditional belief 37 associates five dragon kings with five colored dragons with five directions as aforementioned 19 the text gives the personal names of the kings to the east is the blue dragon spirit king 青龍神王 named axiuhe 阿修訶 阿脩訶 with 49 dragon kings under him with 70 myriad myllion lesser dragons mountain spirits and assorted mei 魅 demons as minions the thrust of this scripture is that in everywhere in every direction there are the minions causing poisonings and ailments and their lord the dragon kings must be beseeched in prayer to bring relief in the south is the red dragon spirit king named natouhuati 那頭化提 in the west the white called helousachati 訶樓薩叉提 訶樓薩扠提 in the north the blue called nayetilou 那業提婁 and at center the yellow called duluoboti 闍羅波提 with different numbers subordinate dragon kings with minion hordes of lesser dragons and other beings 38 18 though connection of poison to rainmaking may not be obvious it has been suggested that this poison banishing sutra could could have viably been read as a replacement in the execution of the ritual to pray for rain shōugyōhō 請雨経法 in japan 39 a medieval commentary ryūō kōshiki copied 1310 has reasoned that since the great peacock mahāmāyūrī sūtra mandates one to chant dragon names in order to detoxify so shall offerings made to dragon lead to sweet rain 40 divine incantations scripture edit the wangfang five position dragon kings are also attested in the taishang dongyuan shenzhou jing 太上洞淵神咒經 most high cavernous abyss divine spells scripture d 8 though not explicitly under the collective name of five position dragon kings but individually as eastern direction s blue emperor blue dragon king 東方青帝青龍王 and so forth 41 it gives a laundry list of dragon kings by different names stating that spells to cause rain can be performed by invoking dragon kings 42 ritual process edit an ancient procedural instruction for invoking five colored dragons to conduct rainmaking rites occurs in the luxuriant dew of the spring and autumn annals under its seeking rain chapter originally 2nd century b c it prescribes earthenware figurines of greater and lesser dragons of a specific color according to season namely blue green red yellow white black depending on whether it was spring summer late summer jixia zh autumn or winter and these figures were to be placed upon the alter at the assigned position direction east south center west or north 43 this chinese folk rain ritual later became incorporated into daoism 42 the rituals were codified into daoist scripture or buddhist sūtras in the post later han six dynasties zh period 13 but dragon king worship did not come into ascendancy until the sui tang dynasties 21 the rain rituals in esoteric buddhism in the tang dynasty was actually an adaptation of indigenous chinese dragon worship and rainmaking beliefs rather than pure buddhism 42 as a point of illustration a comparison can be made against buddhist procedures for rainmaking during the tang dynasty the rainmaking tract in the collected dhāraṇī sūtras zh e book 11 under the chapter for rain prayer altar method qiyu tanfa 祈雨壇法 prescribes an altar to be built with mud figures of dragon kings placed on the four sides and numerous mud made lesser dragons arranged within and without the altar 42 45 dragon kings of the four seas edit temple of the dragon king of the south sea in sanya

prayers invoking dragon kings under system known as shōugyōhō ja or shōugyō no hō established in the shingon sect founded by priest kūkai who learned buddhism in tang china it was first performed by kūkai in the year 824 at shinsen en according to legend but the first occasion probably took place historically in the year 875 then a second time in 891 the rain ritual came to be performed regularly 46 47 the shōugyōhō ritual used two mandalas that featured dragon kings the great mandala which was hung up was of a design that centered around sakyamuni buddha surrounded by the eight great dragon kings ja the ten thousand dragon kings bodhisattvas based on the dayunlun qingyu jing 大雲輪請雨經 scripture of summoning great clouds and petitioning for rain 47 48 49 the other one was a spread out mandala shiki mandara 敷曼荼羅 laid flat out on its back and depicted five dragon kings which were one three five seven and nine headed based on the collected dhāraṇī sūtras 47 also there was the five dragons festival ritual goryūsai 五龍祭 was performed by onmyōji or yin yang masters 28 50 the oldest mention of this in literature is from fusō ryakuki entry of engi 2 902ad 17th day of the 6th moon 50 sometimes the performance of the rain ritual by esoteric buddhists shōugyōhō would be followed in succession by the five dragons ritual from the yin yang bureau ja 51 the five dragon rites performed by the onmyōji or yin yang masters had its heyday around the 10 11th centuries 50 there are mokkan or inscribed wooden tablets used in these rites that have been unearthed e g from 8 10th century site and a 9th century site 52 in japan there also developed a legend that the primordial being banko pangu of chinese myth sired the five dragon kings who were invoked in the ritual texts or saimon ja read in shinto or onmyōdō rites but the five beings later began to be seen less as monsters and more as wise princes 53 worship of the dragon god edit worship of the dragon god is celebrated

northern alberta 2 nighthawks have small feet of little use for walking and long pointed wings their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves some species perch facing along a branch rather than across it as birds usually do this helps to conceal them during the day the female lays two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground they are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night and feed on moths and other large flying insects the bill opens very wide and has a slightly hooked upper tip nighthawks are similar in most respects to the nightjars but

other uses see warlord disambiguation marshal zhang zuolin one of many warlords in early 20th century china a warlord is a person who exercises military economic and political control over a region in a country without a strong national government largely because of coercive control over the armed forces warlords have existed throughout much of history albeit in a variety of different capacities within the political economic and social structure of states or ungoverned territories the term is most often applied to china in the mid 19th century and the early 20th century the term can also be used for any supreme military leader 1 contents 1 historical origins and etymology 2 conceptions of warlordism 2 1 cooperative warlord politics vs ungoverned warlordism 2 2 warlordism as the dominant political order of pre state societies 2 3 economics of warlordism 2 4 understanding warlordism in the context of european feudalism 3 warlordism in the contemporary world 3 1 cooperative warlord

russian civil war and chechen conflicts 4 3 liberia 5 historical examples of warlordism 5 1 china 5 2 mongolia 5 3 vietnam 5 4 europe 5 5 other examples 6 see also 7 notes 8 references 9 further reading historical origins and etymology edit the first appearance of the word warlord dates to 1856 when used by american philosopher and poet ralph waldo emerson in a highly critical essay on the aristocracy in england piracy and war gave place to trade politics and letters the war lord to the law lord the privilege was kept whilst the means of obtaining it were changed 2 during the first world war the term appeared in china as junfa 軍閥 taken from the japanese gunbatsu it was not widely used until the 1920s when it was used to describe the chaos after 1918 when provincial military leaders took local control and launched the period that would come to be known in china as the warlord era 3 in china junfa is applied retroactively to describe the leaders of regional armies who threatened or used violence to expand their rule including those who rose to lead and unify kingdoms conceptions of warlordism edit warlords were present historically in either pre modern states or weak state societies and in countries designated fragile states or failed states in modern times there is a tremendous degree of variance in the political economic and societal organization structure and institutions of states where warlordism exists there is also a divergence of opinion within the field of political science as to what specifically constitutes warlordism particularly in the context of the historical setting cooperative warlord politics vs ungoverned warlordism edit there are two major functional distinctions when considering warlords and their relationship with a state the first is one in which the warlord functions within the political framework through a degree of bargaining with the state regime so that the warlord sometimes individually and sometimes in a coalition with other warlords is acting with the explicit consent of or at least in accord with the regime this can be viewed as cooperative warlord politics the other is one in which the warlord is operating independently of the state and is viewed as a rebel insurgent or strategic political competitor of the regime this is commonly viewed as ungoverned warlordism warlords can also fall into a hybrid category temporarily joining a warlord coalition in collusion with the regime or defecting for political expedience transitioning from one paradigm to the other based upon strategic interests citation needed warlordism as the dominant political order of pre state societies edit the other major consideration in categorizing warlords is through the lens of history warlordism was a widespread dominant political framework that ordered many of the world s societies until the modern state became globally ubiquitous often warlord governance in pre modern state history was constructed along tribal or kinship lines and was congruent with early perception of nation in colonial empires warlords served in both cooperative political capacities and as leaders of rebellions in modern states the presence of warlords is often seen as an indicator of state weakness or failure american historian david g herrmann noted warlordism is the default condition of humanity 4 economics of warlordism edit economist stergios skaperdas views warlordism as a default albeit inefficient competitive economic model that emerges in states where state capacity is low but that innately evolves into an institution governing political order that uses violence or the threat of it to secure its access to rent producing resources it may actually have a stabilizing effect on a region in both cases there is an inherent inefficiency in the model as resources are wasted on unproductive arming and fighting 5 however the functionality is often sustainable because it presents citizens with no choice but to accept rent levies in exchange for protection charles tilly an american political scientist and sociologist theorized that organized crime can function as a means for war and state making 6 he argues that the monopoly of crime by the state in this case being the warlords is in order to receive protection from external rivals as well as internal political rivals political scientist jesse driscoll uses the term redistribution politics to classify the bargaining process between warlords and the regime in states where cooperative warlord politics prevails and when that bargaining leads to accords or informal arrangements concerning the extraction of rent which can refer to natural resources territory labor revenue or privilege in his study of warlordism in georgia and tajikistan driscoll cites land reform property ownership and transfers privatization in non transparent closed bid settings complex credit swaps cemented via marriages money laundering price fixing schemes and bribery as principal sources of exchange in redistribution politics 7 understanding warlordism in the context of european feudalism edit noted theorist max weber suggested that classic feudalism in pre modern state europe was an example of warlordism as the state regime was unable to exercise a monopoly on the use of force within its territory 8 and the monarch relied on the commitment of loyal knights and other nobility to mobilize their private armies in support of the crown for specific military campaigns as noted french philosopher alexis de tocqueville and political scientists such as e j hobsbawm and theda skocpol observed in their analyses of the ancien régime the french revolution and democratization in europe that commitment was contingent upon a bargaining process in which the king or queen had to guarantee additional territory revenue status or other privileges 9 10 11 meaning that these early european states were weak and the relationship between the crown and feudal lords constituted the form of interdependent warlordism known as cooperative warlord politics under the feudal system of europe nobility whether feudal lords knights princes or barons were warlords in that they served as regional leaders who exercised military economic and political control over subnational territories and maintained private armies to maintain that status while their political power to exercise social order welfare and regional defense within their territory was derived from hereditary rights or edicts from the monarch their military strength afforded them independence and strength to negotiate for privileges should the feudal lord or other noble withdraw his support from the king either in rebellion or to form an alliance with a rival kingdom that feudal lord or noble was now ascribing to the political order of ungoverned warlordism warlordism in the contemporary world edit within political science there is a growing body of research and analysis on warlordism that has emerged within weak states that have gained independence as a result of the collapse of empire 7 12 13 14 warlord states are disproportionately concentrated within two regions the former european colonies of africa and the former soviet republics of eurasia cooperative warlord politics edit while warlords are commonly viewed as regional leaders who threaten the sovereignty of a state there are a number of states where the central government functions in collusion with warlords to achieve its goal of exercising its sovereignty over regions that would otherwise fall outside its control in such decentralized states particularly those where armed groups challenge national sovereignty warlords can serve as useful allies of a central government that is unable to establish a monopoly over the use of force within its national territory the philippines edit as political scientist dr ariel hernandez documented one example is the philippines where successive presidential administrations at least since ferdinand marcos secured power in 1965 have franchised violence to regional warlords to counter the inroads of communist insurgents islamic rebels and organized criminal gangs this has led to the formation of at least 93 partisan armed groups armed militias loyal to regional warlords who in exchange for their loyalty and willingness to use their private armies to quell the threats from these opposition groups are granted a degree of autonomy within designated regions the exclusive right to use violence and the right to profit from the economy of violence that they establish in their own areas 15 afghanistan edit warlordism in afghanistan another state where the central government is unable to extend political military or bureaucratic control over large swaths of territories outside the capital functions cooperatively within the framework of the state at times the warlords with their established militias are able to maintain a monopoly of violence within certain territories they form coalitions with competing warlords and local tribal leaders to present the central government with a challenge and often the state will bargain to gain access to resources or rent loyalty from the warlord and peace in the region 16 in exchange for peaceful coexistence the warlord coalitions are granted special status and privileges including the right to maintain de facto political rule within the agreed upon territory exert force to retain their monopoly over violence and extract rent and resources by limiting access to these privileges members of the dominant warlord coalition create credible incentives to cooperate rather than fight among themselves 17 in the case of afghanistan state warlord bargaining sometimes extends beyond these informal accords and elevates to the status of political clientelism in which the warlords are appointed to formal government positions such as regional governor a title which provides them political legitimacy during the state warlord bargaining phase warlords in afghanistan have a high motivation to prolong war to create political instability expose weakness of the central state prompt regional criticism against the government and continue economic extraction 18 post soviet republics edit in his study of warlordism in georgia and tajikistan political scientist jesse driscoll emphasizes how the collapse of the soviet union precipitated the rise of militant independence seeking nationalist movements within the republics particularly within the central asian and caucasus regions resulting in armed conflict and civil war many strongmen warlords had served in the soviet military police units or intelligence services and had experience operating within highly organized bureaucracies these warlords formed well structured militias that not only established political and economic control over territories but institutionalized bureaucracies to establish and maintain their monopolies over violence and rent and incentivizing the behavior of citizens within a particular geographical space 19 driscoll termed this warlordism militia coalition politics a truce was reached without any disarmament of militias instead the warlord coalitions reached a non violent order producing equilibrium 19 and eventually agreed upon a warlord friendly civilian figurehead to assume head of state duties to demonstrate the legitimacy as a sovereign state to the rest of the world this opened up georgia and tajikistan as states eligible to receive international aid which thereafter became a major source of rent for the warlords providing them with resources to increase their power and influence over these societies as driscoll observed the warlords colluded to create a state 20 ungoverned warlordism or warlords as stationary bandits edit one political theory pioneered by american economist mancur olson posits that warlords can function as stationary bandits in some african states warlord politics can be a product of endowment rich extractable resources some nations such as liberia and sierra leone have had stationary bandits who use extraction of resources such as diamonds cobalt and timber conflict resources in order to increase their political power they often enforce their right to these resources by claiming to be protecting the people 21 these warlords or stationary bandits often partner with compliant foreign firms and create symbiotic relationships to yield greater power for the warlords and a source of wealth for external firms the result is a political system in which a dominant coalition of warlords strips and distributes valuable assets in exchange for bureaucratic services and security from foreign firms 22 stationary bandits can amass power because of their economic connections with foreign firms oftentimes warlords will exert violence on a particular region in order to gain control once in control these warlords can expropriate the property or resources from the people and land and redistribute the riches in exchange for monetary value when people live in a particular region dominated by a warlord they can choose to flee or live within the political structure the warlords have created if the warlords provide protection against external threats of violence the people will be likely to stay and continue living and working in that region even though they are being extorted the trade off becomes protection for extraction and this political framework is common in periphery regions of countries which do not have a strong central government contemporary examples of warlordism edit afghanistan edit modern day afghanistan is a multiethnic multilingual country inhabited by distinct and often competing tribal societies its national borders defined only following the treaty of rawalpindi of 1919 between the united kingdom and the emirate of afghanistan afghanistan was briefly a democratic state until a 1973 coup which resulted in the april revolution of 1978 23 24 historically power in afghanistan has been decentralized and governance delegated locally to ethnic tribal leadership tribal leaders often act as local warlords representing either a tribal confederacy a tribal kinship group or a smaller tribal lineage grouping and are expected to provide security justice and social services to their respective constituencies 25 26 27 there are four dominant ethnic tribes in afghanistan pashtuns tajiks hazaras and uzbeks as well as a number of proportionally smaller tribes 23 the pashtuns are the largest and most dominant ethnic tribe in the country whose name translates to land of the pashtuns note 1 the durand line which forms the border between modern day pakistan and afghanistan has proved a source of contention in afghanistan and a source of challenge for the tribal authorities of afghanistan the line which was negotiated between british diplomat and civil servant mortimer durand and afghan emir abdur khan was a political boundary drawn in 1893 which clearly defined and demarcated the border between afghanistan and the british raj afghanistan unilaterally disputes the legitimacy of the border 24 pashtuns are the prominent ethnic group in eastern afghanistan and western pakistan and the durand line served to split their traditional homeland between two nation states the partitioning of their tribal lands is viewed by pashtun leaders as a threat to their dominance within afghanistan emboldening rival ethnic tribes and has provoked cross border tensions between afghanistan and pakistan 28 while having significant political economic and social impact on afghanistan the intervention of the soviet union 1979 89 afghan civil war 1989 96 taliban regime 1996 2001 2021 present and united states invasion and occupation 2001 2021 have not noticeably disrupted the primacy of ethnic tribal authority and thus the power and influence of warlords in ordering afghan society although the united states and its coalition allies have expended a considerable amount of time effort and resources attempting to foment the centralization of government and consolidation of power in the state with its seat of power in kabul 29 30 31 32 tribal warlords continue to maintain political influence and power throughout the country outside of kabul while most warlords have power vested in them through traditional tribal customs some hold formal regional government positions but in both cases cooperation with the central government remains voluntary and reliant on incentives 33 beginning in 2008 as it became increasingly evident that the central government in kabul was incapable of extending its power and control to much of the country the us military and diplomatic corps began exploring the option of engaging ethnic tribal warlords in negotiations a strategy that continued through the obama administration 34 35 36 russian civil war and chechen conflicts edit further information chechen russian conflict and category chechen warlords warlordism was widespread in civil war era russia 1918 22 many territories were not under the control of either the red government in petrograd later in moscow or the white governments in omsk and rostov these territories were controlled by warlords of various political colors the cossack ataman semyonov held territories in the transbaikalia region and the bloody baron ungern von sternberg was the dictator of mongolia for a short time white generals such as kolchak or denikin are not considered warlords because they created a legitimate though troubled government and military command the term warlord was frequently used when russian and chechen conflicts were reignited in the 1990s liberia edit liberia s former president charles taylor was indicted as a diamond embezzling warlord who aided and abetted african rebels who committed heinous atrocities against millions of african people after seizing power from president samuel doe in a rebellion taylor won elections in 1997 his critics say that he bullied and bought his way to power and once he obtained it he established himself as one of the most brutal and murderous warlords in africa during his term of office taylor was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of his involvement in the sierra leone civil war 1991 2002 his close friends included the late col muammar gaddafi of libya the conservative former ruler of ivory coast félix houphouët boigny the president of burkina faso blaise compaoré and a plethora of businessmen local and foreign who were bent on making money in liberia and disregarded un disapproval taylor was detained by the un backed special court for sierra leone in 2006 after a period of enforced exile in nigeria he was found guilty in april 2012 of all 11 charges levied by the special court including terror murder and rape 9 in may 2012 he was sentenced to 50 years in prison 37 historical examples of warlordism edit china edit main articles warlord era warring states period and five dynasties and ten kingdoms period major chinese warlord coalitions as of 1925 local warlords with their own militias began to emerge in the effort to defeat the taiping rebellion of the 1860s 38 as the manchu bannerman armies faltered and the central authorities lost much of their control the republic of china was led by yuan shikai a dictator the modern warlord era began in 1916 upon his death the national government existed and handled foreign affairs but it had little internal control until the late 1920s 39 a period of provincial and local rule under military strongmen known as the warlord era lasted until the kuomintang kmt chinese nationalist party consolidated its rule over much of the country under generalissimo chiang kai shek in 1928 40 among the prominent leaders called warlords were yan xishan in shanxi province feng yuxiang and wu peifu who had reputations as reformers zhang zuolin who ruled in manchuria until the japanese invasion of 1931 and a number of local warlords with infamous reputations such as zhang zongchang although chiang kai shek ascended with legitimacy into his role of leadership of the kmt by succeeding sun yat sen and was recognized by foreign nations chiang was accused by some of being a warlord because of his rise by military campaign the two year northern expedition campaign 1926 28 not only defeated the beiyang army but also toppled the beiyang government chiang also conquered and conscripted the forces of rival warlords in the central plains war of 1930 this war essentially ended the warlord era albeit with the continuing autonomy of several provinces mongolia edit after the fall of the mongol empire mongolia was divided between the eastern and western mongols at the time of disintegration many warlords tried to enthrone themselves or rule the khanate jointly however there had been powerful de facto leaders in all parts of the mongol empire before the empire and the states that emerged from it were born and shaped in part from the heavy influence of roving bandits these warlords such as genghis khan and his immediate successors conquered nearly all of asia and european russia and sent armies as far as central europe and southeast asia citation needed roving bandits contrary to the concept of stationary bandits offered by mancur olson extract from region to region and stay mobile warlords in mongolia could be characterized by this title because of the mongol empire s lack of definitive borders and consistent expansion and conquest during the 13th and 14th centuries vietnam edit the twelve warlords war was a period ranging from 966 68 characterized by chaos and civil war the reason this period received the title of twelve warlords war or anarchy of the 12 warlords is because of the struggle for power after the illegitimate succession to the throne by dương tam kha after the death of ngô quyền the ensuing two years were marked by local warlords rebelling in order to seize power within their local governments and challenging the dương court as a result the country fractured into 12 regions each led by a warlord this resulted in conflicts and war among the regional warlords who all sought to expand their territory and enhance their power citation needed europe edit warlordism in europe is usually connected to various mercenary companies and their chieftains which often were de facto power holders in the areas where they resided such free companies would arise in a situation when the recognized central power had collapsed such as in the great interregnum in germany 1254 78 in france during the hundred years war after the battle of poitiers or in the kingdom of scotland during the wars of scottish independence free company mercenary captains such as sir john hawkwood roger de flor of catalan company or hugh calveley could be considered warlords several condottieri in italy can also be classified as warlords ygo gales galama was a famous frisian warlord and so was his cousin pier gerlofs donia who was the leader of the arumer zwarte hoop the imperial commanders in chief during the reign of holy roman emperor maximilian i did hold the title kriegsherr of which the direct translation was warlord but they were not warlords in the sense of the word today other warlords could be found in the british isles during the middle ages and up into the early modern period such examples include brian boru of ireland and guthrum of the danelaw who was the commander of the great heathen army and nearly conquered all of england 41 alfred of anglo saxon england 42 first man to unify the anglo saxon kingdoms of europe although it would not be completed until edward the elder s reign in which he conquered the last remnants of the danelaw 43 other examples edit other countries and territories with warlords include iraq myanmar wa state russia chechnya the democratic republic of the congo libya sudan somalia

help him eliminate the competition though originally based in st louis missouri he is a member of the ludlow clan from new england the family inadvertently ran up against the shade a near immortal sometime villain introduced during the 1930s 1940s golden age of comic books the family had a history of ill gotten gains having originally amassed its vast wealth by killing their partners in a

spelled the name i spyder this character named thomas ludlow dalt was one of the five heroes brought together by the vigilante to form a new incarnation of the seven soldiers of victory prior to this he was abducted by the seven unknown men of slaughter swamp after accepting a contract to kill them at their home base in the aforementioned bog it was revealed that the seven had hired him in order to lure him into their headquarters so they could hopefully prepare him to defeat the sheeda though one character criticised recruiting another schmuck with a bow and arrows thomas was given several augmentations in terms of his abilities and gear which included new clothes a jet black helicopter with a black widow hourglass symbol on its base as well as cold blood and perfect aim this spyder is also the son of thomas hallaway and the brother of lucas who usurps the identity by killing his brother his glory is short lived however as he is killed by the evil sheeda and resurrected as their agent this spyder was not actually villainous like his father after a failed assassination attempt on bulleteer s life spyder was greeted by the ghost of greg saunders the original vigilante what occurred during their confrontation is not shown but in seven soldiers 1 spyder shoots the sheeda queen gloriana tenebrae knocking her from her floating castle and she is hit and killed by a car

about the national personification of the united states federal government for its comic book adaptation see uncle sam comics for other uses see uncle sam disambiguation j m flagg s 1917 poster was based on the original british lord kitchener poster of three years earlier it was used to recruit soldiers for both world war i and world war ii into the us army flagg used a modified version of his own face for uncle sam 1 and veteran walter botts provided the pose 2 uncle sam which has the same initials as united states is a common national personification of the federal government of the united states or the country in general according to legend the character came into use during the war of 1812 and may have been named for samuel wilson the actual origin is obscure 3 since the early 19th century uncle sam has been a popular symbol of the u s government in american culture and a manifestation of patriotic emotion 4 while the figure of uncle sam specifically represents the government the female figure of columbia represents the united states as a nation an archaic character brother jonathan was known to represent the american populace uncle sam has developed notoriety for his appearance in military propaganda popularized by a famous 1917 world war i recruiting poster by j m flagg 5 the first reference to uncle sam in formal literature as distinct from newspapers was in the 1816 allegorical book the adventures of uncle sam in search after his lost honor by frederick augustus fidfaddy esq 6 contents 1 earlier personifications 2 evolution 2 1 samuel wilson legend 2 2 development of the character 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading 6 external links earlier personifications edit columbia a female personification of america by american illustrator paul stahr the earliest known personification of the united states was as a woman named columbia who first appeared in 1738 pre us and sometimes was associated with another female personification lady liberty with the american revolutionary war of 1775 came brother jonathan a male personification uncle sam finally appeared after the war of 1812 7 columbia appeared with either brother jonathan or uncle sam but her use declined as a national person in favor of liberty and she was effectively abandoned once she became the mascot of columbia pictures in the 1920s a march 24 1810 journal entry by isaac mayo a midshipman in the us navy states weighed anchor stood down the harbor passed sandy hook where there are two light houses and put to sea first and the second day out most deadly seasick oh could i have got onshore in the hight sic of it i swear that uncle sam as they call him would certainly forever have lost the services of at least one sailor 8 evolution edit samuel wilson memorial in arlington massachusetts photograph of samuel wilson of troy new york uncle sam and columbia in an 1869 cartoon by thomas nast uncle sam often personified the united states in political cartoons such as this one in 1897 about the u s annexation of hawaii uncle sam taking the lead in cutting up china in j s pughe s cartoon puck magazine august 23 1899 poster by the united states fuel administration during world war one uncle sam needs that extra shovelful an 1810 edition of niles weekly register has a footnote defining uncle sam as a cant term in the army for the united states 9 presumably it came from the abbreviation of the united states u s samuel wilson legend edit the precise origin of the uncle sam character is unclear but a popular legend is that the name uncle sam was derived from samuel wilson a meatpacker from troy new york who supplied rations for american soldiers during the war of 1812 there was a requirement at the time for contractors to stamp their name and where the rations came from onto the food they were sending wilson s packages were labeled e a u s when someone asked what that stood for a co worker jokingly said elbert anderson the contractor and uncle sam referring to wilson though the u s actually stood for united states 10 doubts have been raised as to the authenticity of this story as the claim did not appear in print until 1842 11 additionally the earliest known mention definitely referring to the metaphorical uncle sam is from 1810 predating wilson s contract with the government 8 development of the character edit in 1835 brother jonathan made a reference to uncle sam implying that they symbolized different things brother jonathan was the country itself while uncle sam was the government and its power 12 a clockmaker in an 1849 comedic novel explains we call the american public uncle sam as you call the british john bull 13 by the 1850s the names brother jonathan and uncle sam were being used nearly interchangeably to the point that images of what had previously been called brother jonathan were being called uncle sam similarly the appearance of both personifications varied wildly for example one depiction of uncle sam in 1860 showed him looking like benjamin franklin 14 while a contemporaneous depiction of brother jonathan 15 looks more like the modern version of uncle sam though without a goatee an 1893 article in the lutheran witness claims uncle sam was simply another name for brother jonathan when we meet him in politics we call him uncle sam when we meet him in society we call him brother jonathan here of late uncle sam alias brother jonathan has been doing a powerful lot of complaining hardly doing anything else sic 16 uncle sam did not get a standard appearance even with the effective abandonment of brother jonathan near the end of the american civil war until the well known recruitment image of uncle sam was first created by james montgomery flagg during world war i the image was inspired by a british recruitment poster showing lord kitchener in a similar pose citation needed it is this image more than any other that has influenced the modern appearance of uncle sam an elderly white man with white hair and a goatee wearing a white top hat with white stars on a blue band a blue tail coat and red and white striped trousers flagg s depiction of uncle sam was shown publicly for the first time according to some on the cover of the magazine leslie s weekly on july 6 1916 with the caption what are you doing for preparedness 1 17 more than four million copies of this image were printed between 1917 and 1918 flagg s image was also used extensively during world war ii during which the us was codenamed samland by the german intelligence agency abwehr 18 the term was central in the song the yankee doodle boy which was featured in 1942 in the musical yankee doodle dandy there are two memorials to uncle sam both of which commemorate the life of samuel wilson the uncle sam memorial statue in arlington massachusetts his birthplace and a memorial near his long term residence in riverfront park troy new york wilson s boyhood home can still be visited in mason new hampshire samuel wilson died on july 31 1854 aged 87 and is buried in oakwood cemetery troy new york in 1976 uncle sam was depicted in our nation s 200th birthday the telephone s 100th birthday by stanley meltzoff for

detective related questions using a combination of signals and rewards giving the illusion that he could discover the deepest secrets of the public bobo formed a strong bond with thorpe because thorpe took care of him and gave him a simpler life than in the jungle the success of the act lasted until a trip to florida at which time rex the wonder dog took him to the fountain of youth where he gained the ability to speak to all living creatures even humans in their own language as well as eternal youth rex s and bobo s journey to the fountain of youth was originally depicted in the aforementioned dc comics presents 35 july 1981 4 the intelligence bobo gained put a damper on the success of the sideshow act and in at least one instance he decided that a woman had in fact murdered her sister and shared his insights with the local police at some point after this bobo was employed by the bureau of amplified animals it is not known how he left or even if the bureau still exists 5 after the death of fred thorpe he began to work by himself initially he did quite well as a chimp detective was seen as a novelty during this successful period he was visited by another detective john jones actually the martian manhunter during the jlape crisis who thought bobo s agency seemed to be doing better than his own 6 however as an ape without civil rights and being unable to stand as a juridical person he could not enforce unpaid bills when the public began to forget him he became an alcoholic never leaving the other dimensional oblivion bar which changed management twice during his time there until

magic and began killing wizards detective chimp while still mostly drunk coerces a group of mystical characters gathered from the oblivion bar into battling the spectre this leads to the formation of the group the shadowpact 1 although lacking superhuman powers detective chimp exhibits not only fine detective skills but also the genius of a true tactician benefiting from the counsel of the phantom stranger at the time transformed into a mouse he devises a plan to use the powers of black alice and nightshade to confront the combined menace of eclipso and the spectre bobo also helps clean up the demonic damage left from the rock of eternity s explosion over gotham city he captures the sin of sloth which had possessed his long time friend rex the wonder dog after the rock is reformed the sins

that he uses to assist the gotham city police in apprehending the villain trickster after struggling against the temptation of the helmet bobo sends it on to another journey 10 recently it has been

written human languages he is also one of the most highly skilled investigators in the world with detective skills rivaling those of ralph dibny and batman bobo has an intelligence quotient estimated to be higher than 98 percent of the adult human population as evidenced by his mensa membership and his ability to decode the voynich manuscript which remained unsolved for over five hundred years 16 detective chimp s hyper intelligence has shown to have its downsides however as he has claimed it is difficult for him to concentrate without the help of alcohol to focus his mind for a brief time detective chimp also had additional sense expanding powers granted him by the helmet of doctor fate because a chimpanzee s muscles are much denser than a human s detective chimp is unable to swim

c4 plants distribution 2 the lagomorphs are the members of the taxonomic order lagomorpha of which there are two living families the leporidae hares and rabbits and the ochotonidae pikas the name of the order is derived from the ancient greek lagos λαγώς hare morphē μορφή form there are 110 recent species of lagomorph of which 109 are extant including 34 species of pika 42 species of rabbit and 33 species of hare contents 1 taxonomy and evolutionary history 2 characteristics 2 1 differences between lagomorphs and other mammals 2 2 differences between families of lagomorphs 2 3 pikas 2 4 hares 2 5 rabbits 3 distribution 4 biology 4 1 digestion 4 2 birth and early life 4 3 sociality and safety 5 classification 5 1 recent genera 5 2 fossil genera 6 references taxonomy and evolutionary history edit other names used for this order now considered synonymous include duplicidentata illiger 1811 leporida averianov 1999 neolagomorpha averianov 1999 ochotonida averianov 1999 and palarodentia haeckel 1895 lilian 2016 1 the evolutionary history of the lagomorphs is still not well understood until recently it was generally agreed that eurymylus which lived in eastern asia and dates back to the late paleocene or early eocene was an ancestor of the lagomorphs 3 more recent examination of the fossil evidence suggests that the lagomorphs may have instead descended from anagaloidea also known as mimotonids while eurymylus was more closely related to rodents although not a direct ancestor 4 the leporids first appeared in the late eocene and rapidly spread throughout the northern hemisphere they show a trend towards increasingly long hind limbs as the modern leaping gait developed the pikas appeared somewhat later in the oligocene of eastern asia 5 lagomorphs were certainly more diverse in the past than in the present with around 75 genera and over 230 species represented in the fossil record and many more species in a single biome this is evidence that lagomorph lineages are declining 6 recent finds suggest an indian origin for the order having possibly evolved in isolation when india was an island continent in the paleocene 7 characteristics edit lagomorphs are similar to other mammals in that they all have hair four limbs i e they are tetrapods and mammary glands and are endotherms lagomorphs possess a moderately fused postorbital process to the cranium unlike other small mammals 8 they differ in that they have a mixture of basal and derived physical traits differences between lagomorphs and other mammals edit despite the evolutionary relationship between lagomorphs and rodents the two orders have some major differences primarily lagomorphs have four incisors in the upper jaw whereas rodents rodentia only have two also lagomorphs are almost strictly herbivorous unlike rodents many of which will eat both meat and vegetable matter they are similar to rodents in that their incisor teeth grow continuously throughout their lives thus necessitating constant chewing on fibrous food to prevent the teeth from growing too long 9 10 lagomorphs and rodents form the clade or grandorder glires lagomorphs have no paw pads instead the bottoms of their paws are entirely covered with fur 11 12 similarly to the rodents bats and some mammalian insectivores they have a smooth surfaced cerebrum 13 lagomorphs are unusual among terrestrial mammals in that the females are larger than males this is extremely rare among terrestrial mammals 14 differences between families of lagomorphs edit rabbits and hares move by jumping pushing off with their strong hind legs and using their forelimbs to soften the impact on landing pikas lack certain skeletal modifications present in leporids such as a highly arched skull an upright posture of the head strong hind limbs and pelvic girdle and long limbs 15 also pikas have a short nasal region and entirely lack a supraorbital foramen while leporids have prominent supraorbital foramina and nasal regions 16 pikas edit american pika in alberta pikas also known as conies 17 are entirely represented by the family ochotonidae and are small mammals native to mountainous regions of western north america and central asia they are mostly about 15 cm 6 in long and have greyish brown silky fur small rounded ears and almost no tail their four legs are nearly equal in length some species live in scree making their homes in the crevices between broken rocks while others construct burrows in upland areas the rock dwelling species are typically long lived and solitary having one or two small litters each year contributing to stable populations the burrowing species in contrast are short lived gregarious and have multiple large litters during the year these species tend to have large swings in population size the gestation period of the pika is around one month long and the newborns are altricial they require parental care 18 the social behaviour of the two groups also differs the rock dwellers aggressively maintain scent marked territories while the burrowers live in family groups interact vocally with each other and defend a mutual territory pikas are diurnal and are active early and late in the day during hot weather they feed on all sorts of plant material as they do not hibernate they make haypiles of dried vegetation which they collect and carry back to their homes to store for use during winter 15 hares edit main article hare scrub hare in south africa hares members of genus lepus of family leporidae are medium size mammals native to europe asia africa and north america north american jackrabbits are actually hares species vary in size from 40 to 70 cm 16 to 28 in in length and have long powerful back legs and ears up to 20 cm 8 in in length although usually greyish brown some species turn white in the winter they are solitary animals and several litters of young are born fully furred and active during the year in a nest called a form a hollow in the ground amongst dense vegetation they are preyed upon by large mammalian carnivores and birds of prey 19 rabbits edit main article rabbit rabbits members of family leporidae outside lepus are generally much smaller than hares and include the rock hares and the hispid hare they are native to europe parts of africa central and southern asia north america and much of south america they inhabit both grassland and arid regions they vary in size from 20 to 50 cm 8 to 20 in and have long powerful hind legs shorter forelegs and a tiny tail the colour is some shade of brown buff or grey and there is one black species and two striped ones domesticated rabbits come in a wider variety of colours newborn rabbits are less developed than hares and require parental care although most species live and breed in burrows the cottontails and hispid hares have forms nests most of the burrowing species are colonial and may feed together in small groups rabbits play an important part in the terrestrial food chain eating a wide range of forbs grasses and herbs and being part of the staple diet of many carnivorous species many breeds of rabbit can be litter trained and assuming they are given sufficient room to run can live happy lives as house pets distribution edit lagomorphs are widespread around the world and inhabit every continent except antarctica however they are not found in most of the southern cone of south america in the west indies indonesia or madagascar nor on many islands although they are not native to australia humans have introduced them there and they have successfully colonized many parts of the country and caused disruption to native species 20 biology edit digestion edit skeleton of alaskan hare museum of osteology like other herbivores lagomorphs have to deal with a bulky diet in which the cell walls are composed of cellulose a substance which mammalian digestive enzymes are unable to break down despite this lagomorphs have developed a way of extracting maximum nourishment from their diet first they bite off and shred plant tissues with their incisors and then they grind the material with their molars digestion continues in the stomach and small intestine where nutrients are absorbed after that certain food remains get diverted into the caecum a blind ended pouch here they are mixed with bacteria yeasts and other micro organisms that are able to digest cellulose and turn it into sugar a process known as hindgut fermentation other faecal matter passes along the colon and is excreted in the normal way as small dry pellets about four to eight hours after the meal the contents of the caecum pass into the colon and are eliminated as soft moist pellets known as cecotropes these are immediately eaten by the lagomorph which can thus extract all the remaining nutrients in the food 21 birth and early life edit many lagomorphs breed several times a year and produce large litters this is particularly the case in species that breed in underground protective environments such as burrows the altricial young of rabbits called kits are born naked and helpless after a short gestation period and the mother can become pregnant again almost immediately after giving birth the mothers are able to leave these young safely and go off to feed returning at intervals to feed them with their unusually rich milk in some species the mother only visits and feeds the litter once a day but the young grow rapidly and are usually weaned within a month hares live above ground and their litters containing leverets are born in forms concealed among tussocks and scrub they have a strategy to prevent predators from tracking down their litter by following the adults scent they approach and depart from the nesting site in a series of immense bounds sometimes moving at right angles to their previous direction 22 the young are precocial and a small number are born after a longer gestation period already clad in short fur and able to move around 10 sociality and safety edit many species of lagomorphs particularly the rabbits and the pikas are gregarious and live in colonies whereas hares are generally solitary species although many hares travel and forage in groups of two three or four the rabbits and pikas rely on their holes as places of safety when danger threatens but hares rely on their long legs great

antihero appearing in american comic books published by dc comics created by jack kirby etrigan is a demon from hell who despite his violent tendencies usually finds himself allied with the forces of good mainly because of the alliance between the heroic characters of the dc universe and jason blood a human to whom etrigan is bound etrigan is commonly depicted as a muscular humanoid creature with orange or yellow skin horns red eyes and pointed webbed ears who frequently speaks in rhymes the character was originally based in gotham city leading to numerous team ups with batman etrigan was inspired by a comic strip of prince valiant in which the eponymous character dressed as a demon kirby gave his creation the same appearance as valiant s mask 1 the mask may have been inspired by the silent film häxan since his conception etrigan has been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics including animated series films and video games contents 1 publication history 1 1 the new

edit etrigan the demon first appeared in the demon 1 september 1972 2 and was created by jack kirby he created the demon at the behest of dc who saw it as likely to be more commercially successful than the fourth world and thus cancelled new gods and forever people to facilitate his working on the new title 3 according to mark evanier kirby had no interest in horror comics but created etrigan in response to a demand from dc for a horror character kirby was annoyed that the first issue sold so well that dc required him to do sixteen issues and abandon the fourth world titles before he was done with them 4 etrigan returned for a four issue miniseries in 1987 written and illustrated by grendel creator matt wagner alan grant followed this with an etrigan feature in action comics weekly 636 641 and a second ongoing title in 1990 the 1990 series lasted 58 issues two annuals and one 0 issue garth ennis took over the title beginning with issue 40 ennis run included the first appearance of his character hitman this series was followed by a miniseries driven out following this john byrne s blood of the demon lasted 17 issues and ignored much of the continuity i e harry matthews is human and not a pillow with human facial features that took place after kirby s initial run while his first monthly comic book series was short lived and his second was canceled after five years etrigan remains a popular supporting character with occasional additional miniseries 5 popular series in which etrigan has appeared include neil gaiman s the sandman alan moore s swamp thing kevin smith s green arrow and batman the widening gyre garth ennis s hitman and cosmic odyssey by jim starlin and mike mignola the new 52 edit in the new 52 rebooted continuity dc comics launched a new

edit etrigan son of the demon belial is summoned by the wizard merlin his half brother 10 11 unable to gain the creature s secrets he bonds the demon with jason blood a knight in king arthur s camelot this renders jason immortal which he alternately considers either a penance or a curse in modern times jason blood resurfaces as a prominent demonologist in gotham city jason is called to the crypt of merlin and discovers a poem that causes him to switch places with etrigan appearing to transform him into etrigan to his misfortune he is followed by the long lived morgaine le fey who lusts for merlin s secrets that leads to etrigan s first major battle over the years etrigan both clashes with and occasionally aids earth s heroes guided by his own whims and jason s attempts to turn his infernal power to good use some time after his first appearance etrigan begins speaking in rhyme due to a promotion in hell 12 13 though he is not limited to rhyme 14 he leads the forces of hell in the great battle against the great evil beast and is in brief contact with the entity in its questions about its nature he barely survives the attempt 15 16 his high rank would also see him guide dream of the endless from hell s gates to lucifer some time after this jason blood and glenda mark attempt to separate blood and etrigan an event which leads to blood s ally harry matthews being devoured and later turned into a pillow by belial at the end of these events etrigan and blood are separated 17 both began to age and during the event known as cosmic odyssey blood and etrigan were merged once again 18 after the remerging the relationship between blood and etrigan becomes even more contentious drawn to hell by the archfiend asteroth etrigan stops asteroth s attempt to sacrifice glenda mark randu singh merlin and blood himself in hell blood and etrigan were at the time separated 19 etrigan followed these events by overthrowing the triumvirate of leaders in hell lucifer belial and beezlebub and taking the symbol of authority in hell the crown of horns for himself separated from blood via the crown s power and about to destroy him merlin reminded blood of his own power jason blood spoke the incantation and remerged with etrigan and they were drawn back to earth 20 there he fought lobo klarion the witch boy and his gang 21 and was drawn into the realm beyond where he met the thing that cannot die and was reunited with his older brother lord scapegoat 22 upon escape from the realm beyond 23 etrigan and blood agreed to work together and teamed with batman and robin against the howler 24 soon after etrigan was chosen as a political candidate for president of the united states and nearly succeeded in securing the republican nomination from george h w bush during his political run he attempted to gain superman s endorsement but was denied it 25 when jason blood s daughter was born he decided to destroy etrigan and hired metahuman hitman tommy monaghan to help him after a battle against both merlin and etrigan the two of them rescued the baby and blood was able to steal the demon s heart essentially neutralizing the demon and binding him to jason s will at the end of the battle to gain the demon s heart jason blood left the child kathryn mark with her mother glenda mark jason told glenda before he had left take care of our daughter glenda i think it would be best if she never knew about her father blood then skipped out on paying monaghan the 2 000 000 he had promised 26 etrigan became listless and ceased to rhyme when monaghan needed an edge against the demon mawzir he conned blood into returning to gotham and using etrigan to retrieve the ace of winchesters an anti demon rifle from hell all while preparing to force the demonologist to let the monster onto earth again despite the real risk that etrigan would kill him in vengeance monahgan traded etrigan his heart for the ace of winchesters once more forcing blood to have the full burden of their merging and returning etrigan to his full strength though etrigan reneged on the deal and tried to kill monaghan anyway 27 despite blood s own doubts about himself when the justice league vanished during their attempt to rescue aquaman from the past batman s emergency program designed to assemble a substitute justice league in the event that the originals were ever killed selected blood as the team s magic expert a pre recorded message batman had left for blood assuring the sorcerer that he would not give etrigan the keys to the watchtower unless he was certain that he could be controlled while working with the team jason spent some time reinforcing the watchtower s magical defences during the subsequent fight with gamemnae jason sacrificed himself to free zatanna from her control although he later escaped gamemnae s quagmire spell thanks to the martian manhunter telepathically prompting his transformation into etrigan 28 the crisis resolved jason handed his duties as the league s magic expert over to manitou raven newly arrived in the present before departing 29 the series blood of the demon plotted and drawn by john byrne and scripted by will pfeifer began in may 2005 etrigan apparently loses the restrictions imposed upon him by the wizard merlin which turned him from evil caused by his murder at the exact moment he was transforming from his human self jason blood into his demon self it turns out that the incident has resulted in jason blood being able to exert some will over etrigan s violent nature whereas previously the two remained separate only one existing at a time blood of the demon ended with issue 17 in july 2006 etrigan later attempts to use the trident of lucifer to take control of hell a makeshift shadowpact team successfully takes the trident from him and flees to the supernatural oblivion bar etrigan follows and battles the team inside the bar he is turned into stone via magical pistols and is used as a hat rack the pistols magic would return etrigan to normal at sunrise which never happens within the bar 30 etrigan takes part in the war for control of hell on behalf of neron duelling blue devil later due to the effects of a magical drug satanus had infested hell with he was transformed into a soulless physical human a perfect duplicate of jason blood blood meanwhile has taken steps as to interfere with any possible attempts of etrigan s to re merge 31 during the blackest night event blood s body is possessed by deadman who invokes etrigan s transformation using his flames to hold back the black lanterns 32 etrigan briefly appears in the prelude to the jla jsa crossover during the brightest day event etrigan travels to germany in order to find a crashed meteorite that contains an unconscious jade and is drawn into a confrontation with the justice league after attacking a squad of german superheroes he mocks the league by claiming they are an inferior team of substitutes but is ultimately defeated when donna troy uses her lasso of persuasion to force him back into his jason blood form jason apologizes for the trouble he caused and departs from the scene but not before warning batman and his teammates that the meteorite possesses supernatural qualities the meteor is later revealed to be the starheart a legendary entity that has the power to possess metahumans with magical or elemental abilities 33 etrigan is shown aiding the jla during their mission into hell where he helps hawkman defeat a demonic beast 34 he also was the guide to the secret six in their trip to hell and led catman to see the fate of his father all the while amused by the confusion and pain they were suffering as a result of their visit the new 52 edit in the new 52 the 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe his past and origins are largely changed before the dark ages etrigan was a rhyming demon one not yet good at rhyming in lucifer s service and after too many indignities he led a rebellion lucifer waited until the last moment before handing him over to merlin the two had struck a deal jason of norwich had been sent to camelot as a scribe to merlin and was growing frustrated with life believing he was meant for greater things and suffering from rages a prophecy showed that if jason did not have some sort of quest to force him to heal himself his rage would grow and cause him to kill his love madame xanadu at the fall of camelot merlin bonded etrigan to jason in an attempt to provide this quest 35 now immortal jason and etrigan came to an agreement and shared their existence madame xanadu began traveling with jason only to find etrigan had now begun falling for her as well and would slaughter innocents if he thought she and jason were happy together in order to placate the demon she pretended to be in love with him and cuckolding jason 36 over the centuries jason became known as jason o the blood and etrigan continued to practice his rhymes by the dark ages he and etrigan became the centre of a rag tag team of adventurers the demon knights jason etrigan xanadu vandal savage shining knight the horsewoman saracen inventor al jabr the numbers in arabic and the amazon exoristos the exile in greek they first fought mordru and the questing queen s army to a standstill before being tasked by the city of alba sarum to return merlin to life at avalon both jason and etrigan were enraged at having missed the chance to get him to separate them etrigan plotted to betray his teammates souls and avalon itself to lucifer in order to curry his favour 37 while he successfully manipulated the knights into letting hell invade avalon and secretly felt guilty about his treatment of xanadu he was himself captured and used by the questing queen to gain access as well lucifer believed etrigan had done this deliberately and condemned him outraged the demon refused to serve anyone again at the end of the battle jason was tasked as a member of avalon s stormwatch but neither he nor xanadu wanted to serve merlin after having etrigan forced on them again jason vowed to not let the demon out so often 38 39 40 in the present etrigan s body lies buried in london it is explained that he was sealed there by his own friends because of his betrayal of them but magic emanating from it is able to possess persons above eventually freeing the demon who promptly attacks midnighter and apollo 41 the entire stormwatch then battles etrigan but even after being defeated he is able to possess a host and flees 42 during the trinity war storyline etrigan the demon is among the superheroes that feels the disturbance in the magical plane when shazam picks up pandora s box 43 in the timeline of the new 52 futures end zatanna is romantically involved with etrigan 44 45 characterization edit transformation incantation edit in order to transform into etrigan blood must recite the poem from merlin s crypt though usually he only recites the last two lines the poem does not have to be spoken for it to work for instance in one adventure blood is magically transformed into a fly unable to speak blood triggers the change by writing out the poem in the dust 46 change change o form of man free the prince forever damned free the might from fleshy mire boil the blood in the heart for fire gone gone o form of man and rise the demon etrigan to return to human form a couplet must be recited either by etrigan or someone else in his hearing but there are several versions of it begone begone o etriganresume once more the form of man gone now o etriganand rise again or rise once more the form of man in other media such as the justice league dark animated film a different poem is used to return etrigan to human form since the battle s fought and won jason blood with me is done powers and abilities edit etrigan edit even among demons etrigan is considered to be extremely powerful he has mystically enhanced superhuman strength to the degree that he can stand against other powerhouses such as superman wonder woman and lobo he has a high degree of resistance to injury and can project hellfire from his body usually from his mouth he has a very high command of magic other powers include mystically enhanced fangs and claws enhanced senses super speed agility telepathy energy blasts and precognition his sadomasochistic nature allows him to enjoy pain as if it were pleasure making him generally fearless in the face of combat and torture his healing factor can handle an incredible amount of damage allowing him to recover from wounds that have removed large sections of his body he also has pyrokinesis and cryokinesis enabling him to manipulate fire and ice jason blood edit jason blood is a highly skilled hand to hand combatant including mastery in swordsmanship jason is adept at magic and is often called upon to act as an advisor or investigator in occultic matters he has limited precognition and telepathy jason is technically immortal due to his connection to the demon etrigan he has the combined experiences of etrigan since he was bonded to the demon jason blood shares all of etrigan s weaknesses weaknesses limitations edit etrigan has all the limitations usually associated with a demon including a weakness towards holy powers holy water and iron while his command of magic is strong but considered to be less than his father belial and half brother merlin the magician additionally belial granted the power of etrigan to both merlin and another son lord scapegoat he is also helpless against those with magical powers strong enough to control him such as morgaine le fey he is also said to have a strong frailty for certain sounds as well other versions edit in justice league europe annual 2 a time lost dimitri pushkin ends up in

creation and concept edit newsarama held an interview with lilah sturges the writer of jsa all stars to discuss the series one of the questions asked was whether anna would be seen more sturges replied yes we ll definitely be seeing more of anna fortune i won t say that she s officially a member of the team but she ll be around and we ll learn more about her and her last name is no accident if there s another character in the dcu named fortune but probably in a different way than you might expect 1 fictional character biography edit while the jsa all stars were struggling in a battle against the king of tears a powerful beast summoned by johnny sorrow anna fortune instantly appeared in the scene after leaving her boyfriend wildcat at home and took out a gauntlet and trapped the king of tears in it she soon revealed to the team that dr fate sent her to help the team saying that he once helped her out of a jam she then instantly began to calibrate a spell that would transport everyone to the subtle realms which is where an all star teammate stargirl was trapped 2 once she cast the spell chaos ensued as they were brought to the subtle realms and when she admitted she got the spell wrong and accidentally released the king of tears anna could not undo her mistake but helped fight alongside the all stars against the king of tears until stargirl managed to kill the king of tears by stabbing it in its heart when the team returned to their base anna joined the team 3 while going on a mission to parador atom smasher asked anna what her story was and about her connection with dr fate anna did not reveal what her story was and once again stated that dr fate got her out of a jam she also mentioned that the only flying machines they have in my day are hot air balloons suggesting she comes from the past most likely the 19th or very early 20th century 4 following this mission she had a flirting conversation with atom smasher in which she told him she was either twenty six or a hundred and eighty seven suggesting her home time period is 1849 5 powers and abilities edit anna fortune has displayed an intermediate skill with magic she has knowledge of multiple spells though she isn t always adept at casting them some of her more successful demonstrated abilities include flight and healing often she will use the launcher mounted on her gauntlet to fire special cartridges she calls spellcasings these are can sized bullet like projectiles with magical contents references edit jsa all stars brings love sorrow action to young heroes by vaneta rogers

the who s who entry establishes that the asylum was named after elizabeth arkham the mother of founder amadeus arkham the original name of the asylum was arkham hospital its dark history began in the early 1900s when arkham s mother having suffered from mental illness most of her life committed suicide it was later revealed that her son actually euthanized her and repressed the memory amadeus arkham decided then as the sole heir to the arkham estate to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill so others might not suffer as his mother had prior to the period of the hospital s remodeling arkham treated patients at the state psychiatric hospital in metropolis where he his wife constance and daughter harriet had been living for quite some time upon telling his family of his plans they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling while there arkham received a call from the police notifying him that serial killer martin mad dog hawkins referred to arkham by metropolis penitentiary while at state psychiatric hospital had escaped from prison and sought his considered opinion on the murderer s state of mind shortly afterward arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open inside he discovered the mutilated bodies of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room with hawkins nickname carved on harriet s body the shock of the murders brings back the memory of killing his mother for many years elizabeth suffered delusions that she was being tormented by a supernatural creature and would call to her son to protect her one day

months until finally electrocuting him in a shock therapy session this incident is treated as an accident by the authorities soon after arkham freefalls into madness he continues his mission even after he is incarcerated in the asylum himself after trying to kill his stockbroker in 1929 he scratches the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and constantly belts out the star spangled banner in a loud voice until the day he dies decades later dr cavendish another doctor in the asylum believes he is a reincarnation of amadeus and frees the inmates towards the end of the story he takes another doctor dr adams hostage dresses himself in the dress of amadeus mother and relates arkham s history to batman before attempting to strangle him dr adams saves batman by killing cavendish with the same razor amadeus used to kill his mother amadeus role in creating the asylum hawkins history with amadeus and amadeus descent into madness have

kill him is unclear and again trying to murder poison ivy by locking her in a cell and letting her die of her titan overdose caused by the joker only for a priest covered in pollen to give ivy the

edit main article hourman rick tyler rick tyler rex s son took over the hourman mantle during the crisis on infinite earths rick swallowed some of his father s miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital after serving for a few years as a member of infinity inc a team composed largely of other jsa member children rick began to grow addicted to miraclo just as his father did he spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until amazo posing as a future incarnation of the android hourman cured him of his miraclo addiction having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health rick joined the jsa in its incarnation as a small band of freedom fighters during the stealing thunder arc the android had given him an hourglass full of tachyons that gave rick random visions one hour into the future as a second gift rick could visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the timepoint frozen in time just before rex s death at one point rick is severely injured in battle and switched places with his father to save his life tyler the android known as the third hourman took rex and some other jsa members to the timepoint to save rick s life the one hour rex was allotted in the timepoint expired just as doctor mid nite and tyler had healed rick of his injuries father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with extant ultimately tyler the android took rex s place and was destroyed when rick and rex returned to earth rick is once again active as hourman and is an active member of the jsa he is married to jesse chambers matthew tyler edit main article hourman android in the 853rd century another hourman an android that was modeled on rex tyler s dna served with both the justice league and the justice society for a time he often perceived himself as rex and also as rex s descendant originally possessing the time manipulating cosmic artifact known as the worlogog he divested himself of most of its power at the suggestion of snapper carr and went about learning to be human after failing to stop extant from escaping a fight hourman quit the jsa and began travelling through the timestream returning when he received a distress call from the jsa as noted above he is believed to have been destroyed at the hands of extant in rex s place although the time traveler rip hunter mentioned that his actions would leave him inactive for a relative year indicating his probable return before he died the android also gave his hourglass to rex tyler who hopes to rebuild him the android briefly used the alias matthew tyler and was often simply called tyler powers and abilities edit neither rex nor rick have any innate powers though it was once theorized that their powers derive from a metagene like many dc superheroes any superhuman abilities they display are derived from the use of miraclo taking miraclo grants a user several abilities for the span of an hour most obvious are the superhuman strength durability increased resistance to physical damage to the extent of being impervious to small arms fire and speed enhancements other lesser known and mentioned powers include night vision and the ability to survive underwater rex and rick both took miraclo in pill form but rick later changed to using a transdermal patch the amount of miraclo that can be taken per day has varied normally it is once a day but in some instances rex has been shown taking another pill as soon as an hour of power runs out one story states that rex needed to wait another hour after the miraclo wore off before taking another dose miraclo works specifically on the tylers and may or may not work on others who take it in one instance it worked on an animal dr mid nite s owl hootie as well as the villain bane rex and rick both wore an hourglass around their necks given to them by the hourman android it was filled with energized tachyons time in its most basic form it gives rick time vision flashes of events that will happen exactly one hour later as well as the ability to touch those out of phase with normal time the latter effect comes to anyone holding the hourglass rex displayed neither of these abilities tyler is often simply called an android but is actually an intelligent machine colony possibly a form of nanotechnology created by tylerco in the far future if damaged this colony can effortlessly multiply and repair his software is encoded with the genetics of rex tyler giving him all of rex s memories he originally possessed the worlogog which gave him complete control over time he later gave all but a shard of it up but not before he absorbed all of batman s memories of the jla though not as powerful as he was originally tyler still retained super strength durability and speed equivalent to a person using miraclo he was able to access an hour of power sixty minutes during which he had power over time he can do many things with this control move between picoseconds travel through time use his own time vision which allows him to see a person s past and future as well as their age or make people and things younger slow a person down until essentially frozen create tunnels between different time periods and share power with other individuals though the amount of time that he provides them power for directly takes away from his sixty minutes tyler activates the hour of power at will and the hourglass on his chest keeps count of the time there seems to be some doubt how often he can use his hour of power like the other hourmans use of miraclo sometimes tyler is said to only have one hour of power a day while at other times he simply must wait another hour to recharge before he can reactivate and it is unclear if he must use that hour of power in one go or if he can spread it out over the course of the day tyler also has a timeship that he can summon from the timestream it is connected to him and reacts to his thoughts it normally appears as a viking style wooden sailing ship adorned with clocks but it can change form as tyler dictates to anything from a simple wooden skiff to a futuristic spaceship and also be used as a weapon as when hourman made a large hand out of it to trap extant the ship can travel through time to alternate timelines or through hypertime in other media edit see also hourman rex tyler in other media and hourman rick

icicle from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search spike of ice formed by water dripping and freezing for other uses see icicle disambiguation long bulbous icicles hang from a branch over a river icicles on a tree dripping icicles an icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes contents 1 formation and dynamics 2 dangers 3 see also 4 references formation and dynamics edit icicles gathered on a street sign in eugene oregon icicles on a street lamp in helsinki finland icicles can form during bright sunny but subfreezing weather when ice or snow melted by sunlight or some other heat source such as a poorly insulated building refreezes as it drips off under exposed conditions over time continued water runoff will cause the icicle to grow another set of conditions is during ice storms when rain falling in air slightly below freezing slowly accumulates as numerous small icicles hanging from twigs leaves wires etc thirdly icicles can form wherever water seeps out of or drips off vertical surfaces such as road cuts or cliffs under some conditions these can slowly form the frozen waterfalls favored by ice climbers icicles form on surfaces which might have a smooth and straight or irregular shape which in turn influences the shape of an icicle 1 another influence is melting water which might flow toward the icicle in a straight line or which might flow from several directions 2 impurities in the water can lead to ripples on the surface of the icicles 1 icicles elongate by the growth of ice as a tube into the pendant drop the wall of this ice tube is about 0 1 mm 0 004 in and the width 5 mm 0 2 in as a result of this growth process the interior of a growing icicle is liquid water the growth of an icicle both in length and in width can be calculated and is a complicated function of air temperature wind speed and the water flux into the icicle 3 the growth rate in length typically varies with time and can in ideal conditions be more than 1 cm 0 39 in per minute given the right conditions icicles may also form in caves in which case they are also known as ice stalactites they can also form within salty water brine sinking from sea ice these so called brinicles can kill sea urchins and starfish which was observed by bbc film crews near mount erebus antarctica 4 5 dangers edit icicles can pose personal and structural dangers 6 icicles that hang from an object may fall and cause injury and or damage to whomever or whatever is below them in addition ice deposits can be heavy if enough icicles form on an object such as a wire beam or pole the weight of the ice can severely damage the structural integrity of the object and may cause the object to break this can also happen with roofs where failure can damage nearby parked vehicles or the contents and occupants of the structure icicles on roofs can also be associated with ice dams which can cause water damage as the water penetrates below the shingles 2 the story of an english youth killed by a falling icicle in 1776 has often been recounted 7 8 9 large icicles that form on cliffs near highways have been known to fall and damage motor vehicles 2 in 2010 five people were killed and 150 injured by icicles in saint petersburg russia after heavy snow that also caused apartment block roofs to collapse as well as creating water

see arion disambiguation not to be confused with orion a musician riding a dolphin on a red figure stamnos 360 340 bc from etruria in this case the musician is an aulete rather than a kitharode as he is playing the flute aulos rather than a kithara arion riding a dolphin by albrecht dürer c 1514 arion on a sea horse by william adolphe bouguereau 1855 arion əˈraɪən greek ἀρίων fl c 700 bc was a kitharode in ancient greece a dionysiac poet credited with inventing the dithyramb the islanders of lesbos claimed him as their native son but arion found a patron in periander tyrant of corinth although notable for his musical inventions arion is chiefly remembered for the fantastic myth of his kidnapping by pirates and miraculous rescue by dolphins a folktale motif 1 contents 1 origins 2 the dithyramb 3 kidnapping by pirates 3 1 mythological parallels 3 2 scholarly interpretations 4 surviving fragment 5 in literature 6 see also 7 notes 8 references 9 bibliography 10 external links origins edit arion was a native of methymna in lesbos and according to some mythological accounts a son of cyclon or of poseidon and the nymph oncaea all traditions about him agree in describing him as a contemporary and friend of periander tyrant of corinth so that he must have lived about bc 700 he appears to have spent a great part of his life at the court of periander but respecting his life and his poetical or musical productions scarcely anything is known beyond the story of his escape from the sailors with whom he sailed from sicily to corinth the dithyramb edit arion is often called the inventor of the dithyrambic poetry and of the name dithyramb as arthur wallace writes as a literary composition for chorus dithyramb was the creation of arion of corinth 2 his fame was established in antiquity and herodotus says arion was second to none of the lyre players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in corinth 3 however j h sleeman observes of the dithyramb or circular chorus it is first mentioned by archilochus c 665 bc arion flourished at least 50 years later probably gave it a more artistic form adding a chorus of 50 people personating satyrs who danced around an altar of dionysus he was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into corinth 4 armand d angour notes that arion s contribution to the reform of the dithyramb which was eventually performed in a circle and called kuklios choros was recognised by ancient sources by the fact that they named his father kukleus circle man 5 arion is also associated with the origins of tragedy of solon john the deacon reports arion of methymna first introduced the drama i e action of tragedy as solon indicated in his poem entitled elegies 6 kidnapping by pirates edit arion on the dolphin by françois boucher 1748 princeton university art museum according to herodotus account of the lydian empire under the mermnads 7 arion attended a musical competition in sicily which he won on his return trip from tarentum whose onomastic founder has a similar story avaricious sailors plotted to kill arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home arion was given the choice of suicide with a proper burial on land or being thrown in the sea to perish he asked for permission to sing a last song to win time jan muller after cornelis van haarlem arion on a dolphin c 1590 national gallery of art playing his kithara arion sang a praise to apollo the god of poetry and his song attracted a number of dolphins around the ship some argue that the dolphins were sent by apollo to rescue arion 8 at the end of the song arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of poseidon at cape tainaron when he reached land being eager for his journey he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there he told his misfortunes to periander the tyrant of corinth who ordered the dolphin to be buried and monument raised to it shortly after word came to periander that the ship on which arion had sailed had been brought to corinth by a storm he ordered the crew to be led before him and inquired about arion but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him the tyrant replied tomorrow you will swear to that at the dolphin s monument because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard and instructed arion to hide in the dolphin s monument the next morning attired as he had been when he had thrown himself into the sea when the tyrant brought the ship s crew to the dolphin s monument and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that arion was dead arion came out of the monument in amazement wondering by what divinity he had been saved the ship s crew was silent the tyrant ordered them to be crucified at the dolphin s monument apollo because of arion s skill with the kithara placed him and the dolphin among the stars 9 this dolphin was catasterised as the constellation delphinus by the blessing of apollo arion playing his kithara and riding dolphins sculpture by jean raon grove of the domes fr gardens of versailles the story as herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature 10 lucian of samosata wittily imagined the dialogue between poseidon and the very dolphin who bore arion 11 augustine of hippo 12 asserted that pagans believed in what they read in their own books and took arion to be a historical individual there is no historicity in this tale according to eunice burr stebbins 13 arion and the dolphins are given as an example of a folkloristic motif especially associated with apollo by irad malkin 14 erasmus instanced arion as one of the traditional poet s topics that sound like historia rather than fabulae though he misremembered that augustine had taken the arion story to be historical 15 mythological parallels edit the pirates episode may be seen as a doublet of the fate of melicertes where the leap into the sea was that of his mother ino transformed into the white goddess leucothea melicertes was carried more dead than alive to the shores where the isthmian games were celebrated in his honour as he was transformed to the hero palaimon who was placated with a nocturnal chthonic rite and the whose winners were crowned with a barren wreath of spruce 16 a similar story of told of the founding of taras in megale hellas magna graecia modern taranto apulia italy when a son of poseidon called taras was shipwrecked his father rescued him by sending a dolphin which he rode to traverse the sea from the promontory of taenarum to the south of italy brought ashore taras founded the city of the same name 17 according to pausanias he was worshiped as a hero who named both the city and the river taras after himself 18 another parallel is the myth of dionysus and the sailors related in the homeric hymns tyrrhenian pirates try to lash the god to the mast but the wood itself starts to sprout and the mast is entwined with ivy like the god s thyrsus the sailors leap into the sea and are transformed into dolphins this is especially interesting because arion is credited with the invention of the dithyramb a dionysiac song form scholarly interpretations edit in light of the above parallels walter burkert interprets the story as a significant development in the history of dionysiac cult released from this gloomy background the cheerful and liberating legend of the sixth century further developed the image of the dolphin rider under the colours of the renewed cult of dionysus 19 c m bowra 20 tied the myth to the period following the expulsion from corinth of the aristocratic bacchiadae who traced their descent from dionysus the cult of the god had to develop new and more democratic forms 21 stewart flory 22 identified herodotus characteristic use of the episode in a historicising context as an example of what flory calls his brave gestures a man faced with death performs with calm dignity some spirited but unnecessary gesture that demonstrates contempt for danger surviving fragment edit a fragment of a hymn to poseidon quoted by aelian and by him ascribed to arion has survived and is contained in bergk s poetae lyrici graeci 23 a poetic translation was made by the english schoolmaster herbert kynaston 24 a more literal prose rendering follows chiefest of gods sea lord poseidon of the trident of gold earth shaking king of the swelling a brine the beasts that swim dance all about thee with fins and lightly bound with nimble flingings of the foot the snub nosed coarsing hounds of bristling mane the dolphin lovers of the muse sea creatures of nereus goddess daughters that he had of amphitrite the

examines and illustrates the story of arion s return to greece see also edit arion a journal of humanities and the classics published at boston university taras another dolphin riding young man saved by dolphins after a shipwreck onomastic founder of taranto the city arion was departing from when captured by pirates melicertes son of ino and king athamas of boeotia ino and melicertes threw themselves off of a large rock at the isthmus of cornith they were then deified as palaemon melicertes and leukothea ino as palaemon melicertes is often depicted mounted on a dolphin amphitrite queen of the sea carried to poseidon her future husband by delphinus after hiding from the god at the atlas mountains dionysus a similar story to arion s ends with dionysus turning a crew of pirate kidnappers into dolphins save for one helmsman who had tried to help dionysus apollo the god came to the site of delphi then known as krisa or pytho due to the python who lived there shaped like a dolphin carrying cretan priests whom he rescued from a shipwreck on his back the site would be named delphi to commemorate this event and apollo would bear the epithet delphinios arion a magical horse

and the vigilante ethos existed long before the word vigilante was introduced into the english language there are conceptual parallels between the dark age and medieval aristocratic custom of private war or vendetta and the modern vigilante philosophy 3 elements of the concept of vigilantism can be found in the biblical account in genesis 34 of the abduction and rape or by some interpretations seduction of dinah the daughter of jacob in the canaanite city of shechem by the eponymous son of the ruler and the violent reaction of her brothers simeon and levi who slew all of the males of the

dictionary image of a fiery purgatory by ludovico carracci purgatory latin purgatorium borrowed into english via anglo norman and old french 1 is according to the belief of some christian denominations mostly catholic an intermediate state after physical death for expiatory purification 2 the process of purgatory is the final purification of the elect which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned 3 tradition by reference to certain texts of scripture sees the process as involving a cleansing fire some forms of western christianity particularly within protestantism deny its existence other strands of western christianity see purgatory 4 as a place perhaps filled with fire some concepts of gehenna in judaism resemble those of purgatory the word purgatory has come to refer to a wide range of historical and modern conceptions of postmortem suffering short of everlasting damnation 5 english speakers also use the word in a non specific sense to mean any place or condition of suffering or torment especially one that is temporary 6 according to jacques le goff the conception of purgatory as a physical place came into existence in western europe toward the end of the twelfth century 7 le goff states that the concept involves the idea of a purgatorial fire which he suggests is expiatory and purifying not punitive like hell fire 8 at the second council of lyon in 1274 when the catholic church defined for the first time its teaching on purgatory the eastern orthodox church did not adopt the doctrine the council made no mention of purgatory as a third place or as containing fire 9 which are absent also in the declarations by the councils of florence 1431 1449 and of trent 1545 1563 10 popes john paul ii and benedict xvi have declared that the term does not indicate a place but a condition of existence 11 12 the church of england mother church of the anglican communion officially denounces what it calls the romish doctrine concerning purgatory 13 but the eastern orthodox church oriental orthodox churches and elements of the anglican lutheran and methodist traditions hold that for some there is cleansing after death and pray for the dead 14 15 16 17 18 the reformed churches teach that the departed are delivered from their sins through the process of glorification 19 rabbinical judaism also believes in the possibility of after death purification and may even use the word purgatory to describe the similar rabbinical concept of gehenna though gehenna is also sometimes described by whom as more similar to hell or hades 20 contents 1

purgatory image of a non fiery purgatory gustave doré illustration for dante s purgatorio canto 24 while use of the word purgatory in latin purgatorium a place of cleansing from the verb purgo to clean cleanse 21 as a noun appeared perhaps only between 1160 and 1180 giving rise to the idea of purgatory as a place 22 what jacques le goff called the birth of purgatory 7 the roman catholic tradition of purgatory as a transitional condition has a history that dates back even before jesus christ to the worldwide practice of caring for the dead and praying for them and to the belief found also in judaism which is considered the precursor of christianity that prayer for the dead contributed to their afterlife purification the same practice appears in other traditions such as the medieval chinese buddhist practice of making offerings on behalf of the dead who are said to suffer numerous trials 5 the catholic church found specific old testament support in after life purification in 2 maccabees 12 42 45 23 part of the catholic biblical canon but regarded as apocryphal by protestants 24 25 5 and according to the catechism of the catholic church praying for the dead was adopted by christians from the beginning 26 a practice that presupposes that the dead are thereby assisted between death and their entry into their final abode 5 the new american bible revised edition authorized by the united states catholic bishops says in a note to the 2 maccabees passage this is the earliest statement of the doctrine that prayers and sacrifices for the dead are efficacious judas probably intended his purification offering to ward off punishment from the living the author however uses the story to demonstrate belief in the resurrection of the just and in the possibility of expiation for the sins of otherwise good people who have died this belief is similar to but not quite the same as the catholic doctrine of purgatory 27 over the centuries theologians and others have developed theories imagined descriptions and composed legends that have contributed to the formation of a popular idea of purgatory much more detailed and elaborate than the quite minimal elements that have been officially declared to be part of the authentic teaching of the church shortly before becoming a roman catholic 28 the english scholar john henry newman argued that the essence of the doctrine is locatable in ancient tradition and that the core consistency of such beliefs is evidence that christianity was originally given to us from heaven 29 the catholic church s teaching on purgatory defined in the second council of lyon 1274 the council of florence 1438 1445 and the council of trent 1545 63 5 30 is without the imaginative accretions of the popular idea of purgatory christianity edit some christians typically roman catholics recognize the doctrine of purgatory while many protestant and eastern orthodox churches would not use the same terminology the former on the basis of their own sola scriptura doctrine combined with their exclusion of 2 maccabees from the protestant canon of the bible the latter because of their rejection of the term purgatory although acknowledging an intermediate state after death and before final judgment for this reason the eastern orthodox offer prayers for the dead catholicism edit the catholic church holds that all who die in god s grace and friendship but still imperfectly purified undergo a process of purification which the church calls purgatory so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven catholicism bases its teaching also on the practice of praying for the dead in use within the church ever since the church began and mentioned in the deuterocanonical book 2 maccabees 12 46 31 the catholic church gives the name purgatory to what it calls the after death purification of all who die in god s grace and friendship but still imperfectly purified 32 though in popular imagination purgatory is pictured as a place rather than a process of purification the idea of purgatory as a physical place with time is not part of the church s doctrine 11 fire another important element of the purgatory of popular imagination is also absent in the catholic church s doctrine the purgatory of catholic doctrine edit at the second council of lyon in 1274 the catholic church defined for the first time its teaching on purgatory in two points some souls are purified after death such souls benefit from the prayers and pious duties that the living do for them the council declared i f they die truly repentant in charity before they have made satisfaction by worthy fruits of penance for sins committed and omitted their souls are cleansed after death by purgatorical or purifying punishments as brother john has explained to us and to relieve punishments of this kind the offerings of the living faithful are of advantage to these namely the sacrifices of masses prayers alms and other duties of piety which have customarily been performed by the faithful for the other faithful according to the regulations of the church 33 a century and a half later the council of florence repeated the same two points in practically the same words again excluding certain elements of the purgatory of popular imagination in particular fire and place against which representatives of the eastern orthodox church spoke at the council 34 the council has likewise defined that if those truly penitent have departed in the love of god before they have made satisfaction by the worthy fruits of penance for sins of commission and omission the souls of these are cleansed after death by purgatorial punishments and so that they may be released from punishments of this kind the suffrages of the living faithful are of advantage to them namely the sacrifices of masses prayers and almsgiving and other works of piety which are customarily performed by the faithful for other faithful according to the institutions of the church 35 the council of trent repeated the same two points and moreover in its 4 december 1563 decree concerning purgatory recommended avoidance of speculations and non essential questions since the catholic church instructed by the holy spirit in conformity with the sacred writings and the ancient tradition of the fathers in sacred councils and very recently in this ecumenical synod has taught that there is a purgatory and that the souls detained there are assisted by the suffrages of the faithful and especially by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar the holy synod commands the bishops that they insist that the sound doctrine of purgatory which has been transmitted by the holy fathers and holy councils be believed by the faithful of christ be maintained taught and everywhere preached let the more difficult and subtle questions however and those which do not make for edification cf 1tm 1 4 and from which there is very often no increase in piety be excluded from popular discourses to uneducated people likewise let them not permit uncertain matters or those that have the appearance of falsehood to be brought out and discussed publicly those matters on the contrary which tend to a certain curiosity or superstition or that savor of filthy lucre let them prohibit as scandals and stumbling blocks to the faithful 36 catholic doctrine on purgatory is presented as composed of the same two points in the compendium of the catechism of the catholic church first published in 2005 which is a summary in dialogue form of the catechism of the catholic church it deals with purgatory in the following exchange 37 210 what is purgatory purgatory is the state of those who die in god s friendship assured of their eternal salvation but who still have need of purification to enter into the happiness of heaven 211 how can we help the souls being purified in purgatory because of the communion of saints the faithful who are still pilgrims on earth are able to help the souls in purgatory by offering prayers in suffrage for them especially the eucharistic sacrifice they also help them by almsgiving indulgences and works of penance these two questions and answers summarize information in sections 1030 1032 38 and 1054 39 of the catechism of the catholic church published in 1992 which also speaks of purgatory in sections 1472 1473 40 role in relation to the church edit the prayers of the saints in heaven and the good deeds works of mercy prayers and indulgences of the living have a twofold effect they help the souls in purgatory atone for their sins and they make the souls own prayers for the living effective 41 since the merits of the saints in heaven on earth and in purgatory are part of the treasury of merit whenever the eucharist is celebrated souls in purgatory are purified i e they receive a full remission of sin and punishment and go to heaven 42 role in relation to sin edit according to the doctrine of the catholic church those who die in god s grace and friendship imperfectly purified although they are assured of their eternal salvation undergo a purification after death so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of god 43 unless redeemed by repentance and god s forgiveness mortal sin whose object is grave matter and is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent causes exclusion from christ s kingdom and the eternal death of hell for our freedom has the power to make choices for ever with no turning back 44 such sin makes us incapable of eternal life the privation of which is called the eternal punishment of sin 45 venial sin while not depriving the sinner of friendship with god or the eternal happiness of heaven 46 weakens charity manifests a disordered affection for created goods and impedes the soul s progress in the exercise of the virtues and the practice of the moral good it merits temporal punishment 46 for every sin even venial entails an unhealthy attachment to creatures which must be purified either here on earth or after death in the state called purgatory this purification frees one from what is called the temporal punishment of sin 45 these two punishments must not be conceived of as a kind of vengeance inflicted by god from without but as following from the very nature of sin a conversion which proceeds from a fervent charity can attain the complete purification of the sinner in such a way that no punishment would remain 45 this purification from our sinful tendencies has been compared to rehabilitation of someone who needs to be cleansed of any addiction a gradual and probably painful process it can be advanced during life by voluntary self mortification and penance and by deeds of generosity that show love of god rather than of creatures if not completed before death it can still be a needed for entering the divine presence 47 saint catherine of genoa said as for paradise god has placed no doors there whoever wishes to enter does so an all merciful god stands there with his arms open waiting to receive us into his glory i also see however that the divine presence is so pure and light filled much more than we can imagine that the soul that has but the slightest imperfection would rather throw itself into a thousand hells than appear thus before the divine presence 48 a person seeking purification from sinful tendencies is not alone because of the communion of saints the holiness of one profits others well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause others thus recourse to the communion of saints lets the contrite sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments for sin 49 the catholic church states that through the granting of indulgences for manifestations of devotion penance and charity by the living it opens for individuals the treasury of the merits of christ and the saints to obtain from the father of mercies the remission of the temporal punishments due for their sins 50 speculations and imaginings about purgatory edit some catholic saints and theologians have had sometimes conflicting ideas about purgatory beyond those adopted by the catholic church reflecting or contributing to the popular image which includes the notions of purification by actual fire in a determined place and for a precise length of time paul j griffiths notes recent catholic thought on purgatory typically preserves the essentials of the basic doctrine while also offering second hand speculative interpretations of these elements 51 thus joseph ratzinger wrote purgatory is not as tertullian thought some kind of supra worldly concentration camp where man is forced to undergo punishment in a more or less arbitrary fashion rather it is the inwardly necessary process of transformation in which a person becomes capable of christ capable of god and thus capable of unity with the whole communion of saints 52 the speculations and popular imaginings that especially in late medieval times were common in the western or latin church have not necessarily found acceptance in the eastern catholic churches of which there are 23 in full communion with the pope some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory the representatives of the eastern orthodox church at the council of florence argued against these notions while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living if souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place 53 the definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that they said were part of their faith also accordingly the agreement known as the union of brest that formalized the admission of the ukrainian greek catholic church into the full communion of the roman catholic church stated we shall not debate about purgatory but we entrust ourselves to the teaching of the holy church 54 fire edit fire has an important place in the popular image of purgatory and has been the object of speculation by theologians speculation to which the article on purgatory in the catholic encyclopedia relates the warning by the council of trent against difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification 55 fire has never been included in the catholic church s defined doctrine on purgatory but speculation about it is traditional the tradition of the church by reference to certain texts of scripture speaks of a cleansing fire 56 in this regard the catechism of the catholic church references in particular two new testament passages if anyone s work is burned up he will suffer loss though he himself will be saved but only as through fire 57 and so that the tested genuineness of your faith more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of jesus christ 58 catholic theologians have also cited verses such as i will put this third into the fire and refine them as one refines silver and test them as gold is tested they will call upon my name and i will answer them i will say they are my people and they will say the lord is my god 59 a verse that the jewish school of shammai applied to god s judgment on those who are not completely just nor entirely evil 60 61 use of the image of a purifying fire goes back as far as origen who with reference to 1 corinthians 3 10 15 seen as referring to a process by which the dross of lighter transgressions will be burnt away and the soul thus purified will be saved 55 62 wrote suppose you have built after the foundation which christ jesus has taught not only gold silver and precious stones if indeed you possess gold and much silver or little suppose you have silver precious stones but i say not only these elements but suppose that you have also wood and hay and stubble what does he wish you to become after your final departure to enter afterwards then into the holy lands with your wood and with your hay and stubble so that you may defile the kingdom of god but again do you want to be left behind in the fire on account of the hay the wood the stubble and to receive nothing due you for the gold and the silver and precious stone that is not reasonable what then it follows that you receive the fire first due to the wood and the hay and the stubble for to those able to perceive our god is said to be in reality a consuming fire 63 origen also speaks of a refining fire melting away the lead of evil deeds leaving behind only pure gold 64 saint augustine tentatively put forward the idea of a post death purgatorial fire for some christian believers 69 it is not incredible that something like this should occur after this life whether or not it is a matter for fruitful inquiry it may be discovered or remain hidden whether some of the faithful are sooner or later to be saved by a sort of purgatorial fire in proportion as they have loved the goods that perish and in proportion to their attachment to them 65 gregory the great also argued for the existence before judgment of a purgatorius ignis a cleansing fire to purge away minor faults wood hay stubble not mortal sins iron bronze lead 66 pope st gregory in the dialogues quotes christ s words in mat 12 32 to establish purgatory but yet we must believe that before the day of judgment there is a purgatory fire for certain small sins because our saviour saith that he which speaketh blasphemy against the holy ghost that it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come mat 12 32 out of which sentence we learn that some sins are forgiven in this world and some other may be pardoned in the next for that which is denied concerning one sin is consequently understood to be granted touching some other 67 gregory of nyssa several times spoke of purgation by fire after death 68 but he generally has apocatastasis in mind 69 medieval theologians accepted the association of purgatory with fire thus the summa theologica of thomas aquinas considered it probable that purgatory was situated close to hell so that the same fire that tormented the damned cleansed the just souls in purgatory 70 ideas about the supposed fire of purgatory have changed with time in the early 20th century the catholic encyclopedia reported that while in the past most theologians had held that the fire of purgatory was in some sense a material fire though of a nature different from ordinary fire the view of what then seemed to be the majority of theologians was that the term was to be understood metaphorically 71 72 pope benedict xvi recommended to theologians the presentation of purgatory by saint catherine of genoa for whom purgatory is not an external but an inner fire the saint speaks of the soul s journey of purification on the way to full communion with god starting from her own experience of profound sorrow for the sins committed in comparison with god s infinite love the soul catherine says presents itself to god still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the beatific vision of god catherine asserts that god is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty we too feel how distant we are how full we are of so many things that we cannot see god the soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of god and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love and love for god itself becomes a flame love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin 73 in his 2007 encyclical spe salvi pope benedict xvi referring to the words of paul the apostle in 1 corinthians 3 12 15 about a fire that both burns and saves spoke of the opinion that the fire which both burns and saves is christ himself the judge and saviour the encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement before his gaze all falsehood melts away 74 this encounter with him as it burns us transforms and frees us allowing us to become truly ourselves all that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw pure bluster and it collapses yet in the pain of this encounter when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us there lies salvation his gaze the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation as through fire but it is a blessed pain in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of god 74 in this way the inter relation between justice and grace also becomes clear the way we live our lives is not immaterial but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards christ towards truth and towards love indeed it has already been burned away through christ s passion at the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves 74 the pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy it is clear that we cannot calculate the duration of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world the transforming moment of this encounter eludes earthly time reckoning it

stefan lochner showing souls in purgatory azulejo of souls in purgatory seville spain popular notion of purgatory as a place edit the island of st patrick s purgatory in his la naissance du purgatoire the birth of purgatory jacques le goff attributes the origin of the idea of a third other world domain similar to heaven and hell called purgatory to paris intellectuals and cistercian monks at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century possibly as early as 1170 1180 previously the latin adjective purgatorius as in purgatorius ignis cleansing fire existed but only then did the noun purgatorium appear used as the name of a place called purgatory 75 st robert bellarmine also taught that purgatory at least the ordinary place of expiation is situated in the interior of the earth that the souls in purgatory and the reprobate are in the same subterranean space in the deep abyss which the scripture calls hell 76 77 the change happened at about the same time as the composition of the book tractatus de purgatorio sancti patricii an account by an english cistercian of a penitent knight s visit to the land of purgatory reached through a cave in the island known as station island or st patrick s purgatory in the lake of lough derg county donegal ireland le goff said this book occupies an essential place in the history of purgatory in whose success it played an important if not decisive role 78 one of the earliest depictions of st patrick s purgatory is a fresco in the convent of san francisco in todi umbria italy 79 80 whitewashed long ago this fresco was only restored in 1976 the painter was likely jacopo di mino del pellicciaio and the date of the fresco is around 1345 purgatory is shown as a rocky hill filled with separate openings into its hollow center above the mountain st patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification in each opening sinners are tormented by demons and by fire each of the seven deadly sins avarice envy sloth pride anger lust and gluttony has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures dante gazes at purgatory shown as a mountain in this 16th century painting le goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the purgatorio the second canticle of the divine comedy a poem by fourteenth century italian author dante alighieri in an interview le goff declared dante s purgatorio represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of purgatory that took place in the course of the middle ages the power of dante s poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this third place whose birth was on the whole quite recent 81 dante pictures the purgatory as an island at the antipodes of jerusalem pushed up in an otherwise empty sea by the displacement caused by the fall of satan which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the earth the cone shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the seven deadly sins or capital vices as they ascend additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates indolent or late repenters at the summit is the garden of eden from where the souls cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect are taken to heaven the catholic church has included in its teaching the idea of a purgatory rather as a condition than a place on 4 august 1999 pope john paul ii speaking of purgatory said the term does not indicate a place but a condition of existence those who after death exist in a state of purification are already in the love of christ who removes from them the remnants of imperfection as a condition of existence 11 similarly in 2011 pope benedict xvi speaking of saint catherine of genoa 1447 1510 in relation to purgatory said that in her day it was depicted mainly using images linked to space a certain space was conceived of in which purgatory was supposed to be located catherine however did not see purgatory as a scene in the bowels of the earth for her it is not an exterior but rather an interior fire this is purgatory an inner fire 12 eastern orthodoxy edit see also prayer for the dead in eastern christianity and orthodox memorial service the dormition of the theotokos a thirteenth century icon while the eastern orthodox church rejects the term purgatory it acknowledges an intermediate state after death and before final judgment and offers prayer for the dead according to the greek orthodox archdiocese of america the moral progress of the soul either for better or for worse ends at the very moment of the separation of the body and soul at that very moment the definite destiny of the soul in the everlasting life is decided there is no way of repentance no way of escape no reincarnation and no help from the outside world its place is decided forever by its creator and judge the orthodox church does not believe in purgatory a place of purging that is the inter mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into heaven where every soul is perfect and fit to see god also the orthodox church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment both purgatory and indulgences are inter corelated theories unwitnessed in the bible or in the ancient church and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing truths of the church if almighty god in his merciful loving kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner it is unknown to the church of christ the church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory 82 eastern orthodox teaching is that while all undergo an individual judgment immediately after death neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the last day 83 with some exceptions for righteous souls like the theotokos blessed virgin mary who was borne by the angels directly to heaven 84 the eastern orthodox church holds that it is necessary to believe in this intermediate after death state in which souls are perfected and brought to full divinization a process of growth rather than of punishment which some orthodox have called purgatory 85 eastern orthodox theology does not generally describe the situation of the dead as involving suffering or fire although it nevertheless describes it as a direful condition 86 the souls of the righteous dead are in light and rest with a foretaste of eternal happiness but the souls of the wicked are in a state the reverse of this among the latter such souls as have departed with faith but without having had time to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance may be aided towards the attainment of a blessed resurrection at the end of time by prayers offered in their behalf especially those offered in union with the oblation of the bloodless sacrifice of the body and blood of christ and by works of mercy done in faith for their memory 87 the state in which souls undergo this experience is often referred to as hades 88 the orthodox confession of peter mogila 1596 1646 adopted in a greek translation by meletius syrigos by the 1642 council of jassy in romania professes that many are freed from the prison of hell through the good works of the living and the church s prayers for them most of all through the unbloody sacrifice which is offered on certain days for all the living and the dead question 64 and under the heading how must one consider the purgatorial fire the church rightly performs for them the unbloody sacrifice and prayers but they do not cleanse themselves by suffering something the church never maintained that which pertains to the fanciful stories of some concerning the souls of their dead who have not done penance and are punished as it were in streams springs and swamps question 66 89 the eastern orthodox synod of jerusalem 1672 declared the souls of those that have fallen asleep are either at rest or in torment according to what each hath wrought an enjoyment or condemnation that will be complete only after the resurrection of the dead but the souls of some depart into hades and there endure the punishment due to the sins they have committed but they are aware of their future release from there and are delivered by the supreme goodness through the prayers of the priests and the good works which the relatives of each do for their departed especially the unbloody sacrifice benefiting the most which each offers particularly for his relatives that have fallen asleep and which the catholic and apostolic church offers daily for all alike of course it is understood that we do not know the time of their release we know and believe that there is deliverance for such from their direful condition and that before the common resurrection and judgment but when we know not 86 some orthodox believe in a teaching of aerial toll houses for the souls of the dead according to this theory which is rejected by other orthodox but appears in the hymnology of the church 90 following a person s death the soul leaves the body and is escorted to god by angels during this journey the soul passes through an aerial realm which is ruled by demons the soul encounters these demons at various points referred to as toll houses where the demons then attempt to accuse it of sin and if possible drag the soul into hell 91 protestantism edit further information criticism of the catholic church criticism of purgatory in general protestant churches reject the catholic doctrine of purgatory although some teach the existence of an intermediate state many protestant denominations though not all teach the doctrine of sola scriptura scripture alone or prima scriptura scripture first the general protestant view is that the bible from which protestants exclude deuterocanonical books such as 2 maccabees contains no overt explicit discussion of purgatory and therefore it should be rejected as an unbiblical belief 92 another view held by many protestants such as the lutheran churches and the reformed churches is sola fide by faith alone that faith alone is what achieves salvation and that good works are merely evidence of that faith 93 justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one s lifetime not the result of a transformation of character however most protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience others such as those of the methodist tradition inclusive of the holiness movement teach that after justification christians must pursue holiness and good works 94 95 those who have been saved by god are destined for heaven while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven 96 some protestants hold that a person enters into the fullness of one s bliss or torment only after the resurrection of the body and that the soul in that interim state is conscious and aware of the fate in store for it 97 others have held that souls in the intermediate state between death and resurrection are without consciousness a state known as soul sleep 98 as an argument for the existence of purgatory protestant religious philosopher jerry l walls 99 wrote purgatory the logic of total transformation 2012 he lists some biblical hints of purgatory mal 3 2 2 mac 12 41 43 mat 12 32 1 cor 3 12 that helped give rise to the doctrine 100 and finds its beginnings in early christian writers whom he calls fathers and mothers of purgatory 101 citing le goff he sees the 12th century as that of the birth of purgatory arising as a natural development of certain currents of thought that had been flowing for centuries 102 and the 13th century at that of its rationalization purging it of its offensive popular trappings leading to its definition by a council as the church s doctrine in 1274 103 walls does not base his belief in purgatory primarily on scripture the mothers and fathers of the church or the magisterium doctrinal authority of the catholic church rather his basic argument is that in a phrase he often uses it makes sense 104 for walls purgatory has a logic as in the title of his book he documents the contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models of purgatory in the satisfaction model the punishment of purgatory is to satisfy god s justice in the sanctification model wall writes purgatory might be pictured as a regimen to regain one s spiritual health and get back into moral shape 105 in catholic theology walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has swung between the poles of satisfaction and sanctification sometimes combining both elements somewhere in the middle he believes the sanctification model can be affirmed by protestants without in any way contradicting their theology and that they may find that it makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death 106 while purgatory was disputed by the reformers some early patristic theologians of the eastern church taught and believed in apocatastasis the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation clement of alexandria was one of the early church theologians who taught this view protestants have always contended that there are no second chances however for lutherans a similar doctrine of what may happen to the unevangelized is expressed in the book titled what about those who never heard 107 the reality of purgatorial purification is envisaged in thomas talbott s the inescapable love of god 108 different views are expressed by different theologians in two different editions of four views of hell 109 anglicanism edit anglicans as with other reformed churches historically teach that the saved undergo the process of glorification after death 110 this process has been compared by jerry l walls and james b gould with the process of purification in the core doctrine of purgatory see reformed below purgatory was addressed by both of the foundation features of anglicanism in the 16th century the thirty nine articles of religion and the book of common prayer 111 article xxii of the thirty nine articles states that the romish doctrine concerning purgatory is a fond thing vainly invented and grounded upon no warranty of scripture but rather repugnant to the word of god 112 prayers for the departed were deleted from the 1552 book of common prayer because they suggested a doctrine of purgatory the 19th century anglo catholic revival led to restoring prayers for the dead 113 john henry newman in his tract xc of 1841 6 discussed article xxii he highlighted the fact that it is the romish doctrine of purgatory coupled with indulgences that article xxii condemns as repugnant to the word of god the article did not condemn every doctrine of purgatory and it did not condemn prayers for the dead 114 as of the year 2000 the state of the doctrine of purgatory in anglicanism was summarized as follows purgatory is seldom mentioned in anglican descriptions or speculations concerning life after death although many anglicans believe in a continuing process of growth and development after death 115 anglican bishop john henry hobart 1775 1830 wrote that hades or the place of the dead is represented as a spacious receptacle with gates through which the dead enter 116 the anglican catechist of 1855 elaborated on hades stating that it is an intermediate state between death and the resurrection in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward 117 this intermediate state includes both paradise and gehenna but with an impassable gulf between the two 16 souls remain in hades until the final judgment and christians may also improve in holiness after death during the middle state before the final judgment 118 leonel l mitchell 1930 2012 offers this rationale for prayers for the dead no one is ready at the time of death to enter into life in the nearer presence of god without substantial growth precisely in love knowledge and service and the prayer also recognizes that god will provide what is necessary for us to enter that state this growth will presumably be between death and resurrection 119 anglican theologian c s lewis 1898 1963 reflecting on the history of the doctrine of purgatory in the anglican communion said there were good reasons for casting doubt on the romish doctrine concerning purgatory as that romish doctrine had then become not merely a commercial scandal but also the picture in which the souls are tormented by devils whose presence is more horrible and grievous to us than is the pain itself and where the spirit who suffers the tortures cannot for pain remember god as he ought to do lewis believed instead in purgatory as presented in john henry newman s the dream of gerontius by this poem lewis wrote religion has reclaimed purgatory a process of purification that will normally involve suffering 120 lewis s allegory the great divorce 1945 considered a version of purgatory in the related idea of a refrigidarium the opportunity for souls to visit a lower region of heaven and choose to be saved or not lutheranism edit the protestant reformer martin luther was once recorded as saying 121 as for purgatory no place in scripture makes mention thereof neither must we any way allow it for it darkens and undervalues the grace benefits and merits of our blessed sweet saviour christ jesus the bounds of purgatory extend not beyond this world for here in this life the upright good and godly christians are well and soundly scoured and purged in his 1537 smalcald articles luther stated 122 therefore purgatory and every solemnity rite and commerce connected with it is to be regarded as nothing but a specter of the devil for it conflicts with the chief article which teaches that only christ and not the works of men are to help set free souls not to mention the fact that nothing has been divinely commanded or enjoined upon us concerning the dead with respect to the related practice of praying for the dead luther stated 123 as for the dead since scripture gives us no information on the subject i regard it as no sin to pray with free devotion in this or some similar fashion dear god if this soul is in a condition accessible to mercy be thou gracious to it and when this has been done once or twice let it suffice confession concerning christ s supper vol xxxvii 369 123 a core statement of lutheran doctrine from the book of concord states we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead which we do not prohibit but we disapprove of the application ex opere operato of the lord s supper on behalf of the dead epiphanius of salamis testifies that aerius of sebaste held that prayers for the dead are useless with this he finds fault neither do we favor aerius but we do argue with you because you defend a heresy that clearly conflicts with the prophets apostles and holy fathers namely that the mass justifies ex opere operato that it merits the remission of guilt and punishment even for the unjust to whom it is applied if they do not present an obstacle philipp melanchthon apology of the augsburg confession 124 high church lutheranism like anglo catholicism is more likely to accept some form of purgatory citation needed lutheran reformer mikael agricola still believed in the basic beliefs of purgatory 125 purgatory as such is not mentioned at all in the augsburg confession which claims that our churches dissent in no article of the faith from the church catholic but only omit some abuses which are new 126 methodism edit further information last judgment methodist churches in keeping with article xiv of purgatory in the articles of religion hold that the romish doctrine concerning purgatory is a fond thing vainly invented and grounded upon no warrant of scripture but repugnant to the word of god 127 however in the methodist church there is a belief in hades the intermediate state of souls between death and the general resurrection which is divided into paradise for the righteous and gehenna for the wicked 128 129 after the general judgment hades will be abolished 129 john wesley the founder of methodism made a distinction between hell the receptacle of the damned and hades the receptacle of all separate spirits and also between paradise the antechamber of heaven and heaven itself 130 131 the dead will remain in hades until the day of judgment when we will all be bodily resurrected and stand before christ as our judge after the judgment the righteous will go to their eternal reward in heaven and the accursed will depart to hell see matthew 25 132 reformed edit main article glorification reformed churches after death reformed theology teaches that through glorification god not only delivers his people from all their suffering and from death but delivers them too from all their sins 19 in glorification reformed christians believe that the departed are raised and made like the glorious body of christ 19 reformed theologian john f macarthur has written that nothing in scripture even hints at the notion of purgatory and nothing indicates that our glorification will in any way be painful 133 jerry l walls and james b gould have likened the glorification process to the core or sanctification view of purgatory 134 grace is much more than forgiveness it is also transformation and sanctification and finally glorification we need more than forgiveness and justification to purge our sinful dispositions and make us fully ready for heaven purgatory is nothing more than the continuation of the sanctifying grace we need for as long as necessary to complete the job 135 latter day saint movement edit main articles spirit world latter day saints plan of salvation latter day saints and mormon cosmology the church of jesus christ of latter day saints teaches of an intermediate place for spirits between their death and their bodily resurrection this place called the spirit world includes paradise for the righteous and prison for those who do not know god spirits in paradise serve as missionaries to the spirits in prison who can still accept salvation in this sense spirit prison can be conceptualized as a type of purgatory in addition to hearing the message from the missionary spirits the spirits in prison can also accept posthumous baptism and other posthumous ordinances performed by living church members in temples on earth this is frequently referred to as baptism for the dead and temple work 136 members of the church believe that during the three days following christ s crucifixion he organized spirits in paradise and commissioned them to preach to the spirits in prison 137 judaism edit in judaism gehenna is a place of purification where according to some traditions most sinners spend up to a year before release the view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the shammaites in the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting the wicked for gehenna but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified for of them it is said i will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined and try them as gold is tried zech xiii 9 also he the lord bringeth down to sheol and bringeth up again i sam ii 6 the hillelites seem to have had no purgatory for they said he who is plenteous in mercy ex xxxiv 6 inclines the balance toward mercy and consequently the intermediates do not descend into gehenna tosef sanh xiii 3 r h 16b bacher ag tan i 18 still they also speak of an intermediate state regarding the time which purgatory lasts the accepted opinion of r akiba is twelve months according to r johanan b nuri it is only forty nine days both opinions are based upon isa lxvi 23 24 from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched the former interpreting the words from one new moon to another to signify all the months of a year the latter interpreting the words from one sabbath to another in accordance with lev xxiii 15 16 to signify seven weeks during the twelve months declares the baraita tosef sanh xiii 4 5 r h 16b the souls of the wicked are judged and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous according to mal iii 21 a v iv 3 whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in gehenna without cessation according to isa lxvi 24 the righteous however and according to some also the sinners among the people of israel for whom abraham intercedes because they bear the abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory er 19b ḥag 27a 138 maimonides declares in his 13 principles of faith that the descriptions of gehenna as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the torah commandments by mankind which had been regarded as immature 139 instead of being sent to gehenna the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated 140 islam edit main article barzakh see also araf islam islam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in christianity barzakh is thought to be a realm between paradise jannah and hell jahannam and according to ghazali the place of those who go neither to hell or to heaven 141 but because it does not purify the souls it resembles more the limbo than the purgatory in some cases the islamic concept of hell may resemble the concept of catholic doctrine of purgatory 142 for jahannam just punishes people according to their deeds and releases them after their habits are purified a limited duration in jahannam is not universally accepted in islam 143 indian

particular art or field for other uses see virtuoso disambiguation a virtuoso from italian virtuoso virˈtwoːzo or virtuˈoːso virtuous late latin virtuosus latin virtus virtue excellence or skill is an individual who possesses outstanding talent and technical ability in a particular art or field such as fine arts music singing playing a musical instrument or composition 1 contents 1 meaning 2 history 3 bibliography 4 references meaning edit this word also refers to a person who has cultivated appreciation of artistic excellence either as a connoisseur or collector the plural form of virtuoso is either virtuosi or the anglicisation virtuosos and the feminine forms are virtuosa and virtuose according to music in the western civilization by piero weiss and richard taruskin 2 a virtuoso was originally a highly accomplished musician but by the nineteenth century the term had become restricted to performers both vocal and instrumental whose technical accomplishments were so pronounced as to dazzle the public the defining element of virtuosity is the performance ability of the musician in question who is capable of displaying feats of skill well above the average performer especially in music both critics and musicians have mixed opinions on virtuosity while the skill implied is clearly positive musicians focused on virtuosity have been criticized for overlooking substance and emotion in favor of raw technical prowess 3 more commonly applied in the context of the fine arts the term can also refer to a master or ace who excels technically within any particular field or area of human knowledge anyone especially or dazzlingly skilled at what they do 1 for instance ken jennings s initial success on jeopardy was described as a virtuoso performance 4 history edit the meaning of virtuoso has its roots in the italian usage of the 16th and 17th centuries signifying an honorific term reserved for a person distinguished in any intellectual or artistic field the term evolved with time simultaneously broadening and narrowing in scope as interpretations went in and out of fashion and debates unraveled originally a musician was considered a virtuoso by being an accomplished composer theorist or maestro rather than a skilled performer 5 in the 17th and 18th centuries the word shifted in meaning and many musicians applied it without considering merit sometimes to themselves sébastien de brossard in his dictionnaire de musique paris 1703 6 7 approached the word virtuoso by its latin root virtu emphasizing exceptional training especially in theory this position was also defended in johann gottfried walther s musicalisches lexicon 1732 favoring the theorist over the performer johann mattheson s der brauchbare virtuoso 8 1720 maintained the respect for the traditional theoretische virtuosen theoretical virtuoso but also paid tribute to the virtuosi prattici performer virtuoso johann kuhnau in his the musical charlatan der musikalische quack salber 1700 defined the true virtuoso once again emphasizing theory der wahre virtuose while describing the highly gifted musician der glückselige musicus or performer virtuoso as having nothing more than practical facility citation needed in the late 18th century people began to use the term to describe an instrumentalist or vocalist who pursued a career as a soloist the tension about the merit of practical virtuosity started to grow at the same time and intensified in the 19th century only to remain an open debate since then franz liszt considered one of the greatest of all virtuosos declared that virtuosity is not an outgrowth but an indispensable element of music gesammelte schriften iv 1855 9 richard wagner opposed the triviality and exhibitionist talents of the performer voicing his opinion strongly the real dignity of the virtuoso rests solely on the dignity he is able to preserve for creative art if he trifles and toys with this he casts his honour away he is the intermediary of the artistic idea 9 bibliography edit doran robert ed liszt and virtuosity rochester university of rochester press eastman studies in music 2020 oclc 1133204755 references edit a b

character biography edit earth two edit originally on earth two just called ghost this criminal clashed twice with hawkman and hawkgirl claiming to be an actual ghost hawkman refused to believe it and the couple s investigation seemed to support that but the original story left the truth ambiguous in their next encounter it was confirmed that the supposed ghost was a mundane criminal named james craddock who had used special tricks and gadgets to pretend to be a ghost 3 4 post crisis edit in post crisis continuity james craddock is the son of an english gentleman who abandoned both jim and his mother forcing them into poverty craddock grew up to become a notorious highwayman and robber who terrorized england in the 19th century under the name gentleman jim after a prophecy from a gypsy said he would be a highwayman he encountered the ghosts of other highwaymen and dick turpin left him a horse he journeyed to the united states and encounters the gunslingers nighthawk and cinnamon the hot headed nighthawk lynched craddock after wrongly assuming that he sexually assaulted cinnamon but craddock somehow eludes death to rise again as a ghost 5 the gentleman ghost learns he must wander the earth until the spirit of his killer moves on to the next plane of existence 6 nighthawk and cinnamon turn out to be the reincarnations of ancient egyptian royalty prince khufu and chay ara their souls due to their exposure to the thanagarian nth metal can never truly pass on both are eventually resurrected as hawkman and hawkgirl and the gentleman ghost becomes their recurring nemesis during the 1940s 7 craddock has over the decades menaced other heroes including batman the atom flash the new teen titans max mercury and stargirl but the vengeful ghost always returns to his main foes the hawks sometimes as a foe and sometimes as a friend gentleman ghost later appears as a member of the injustice society 8 during the infinite crisis storyline he joins alexander luthor jr s secret society of super villains he fought alan scott and placed him in a coma 9 his origin is explored and altered in the pages of jsa 82 87 2006 the natural son of an abusive father and a poor mother young jim craddock soon slips into a life of crime making contacts with the supernatural after a gypsy prophesies that he will be able to transcend death and return to life fighting and killing his enemies on english soil his villainous career is put to an end when he is captured and sentenced to death by hanging after he is tricked by a woman he is trying to seduce who summons redcoats returning as a ghost he battles those on jsa hoping for the prophecy to come true when the rightful time arrives the ghost gains the additional power of summoning vengeful ghosts from his enemies the jsa past like someone scott killed with an electrical accident although this is a fake and other highwaymen his plan is foiled by stargirl who as a virgin girl is impervious to ghostly attacks an army of ghostly nobles who attack his army and wildcat surprisingly a descendant of the royal house of england who decapitates him vanquished he disappears 10 gentleman ghost is seen as one of the villains sent to retrieve the get out of hell free card from the secret six the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe gentleman ghost is still a thief and is not a ghost like his earth two counterpart 11 in his first appearance he steals the mortis orb which has the power to resurrect the dead 12 hawkman deduces that gentleman ghost is jim craddock and gentleman ghost confirms it gentleman ghost tells hawkman he invited him here because the nth metal drew him to the mortis orb then he tells hawkman he will take him to the orb but hawkman refuses so gentleman ghost sends more apparitions after him hawkman escapes the building then gentleman ghost appears again saying that the warlock s spell rendered the orb inert years ago but the nth metal broke the spell causing the orb to regain its power gentleman ghost takes the orb saying that he will use it to transcend death and resurrect himself through the life force of every man woman and child nearby then he disappears and the zombies attacking hawkman fall apart 13 gentleman ghost begins fully harnessing the orb s power creating a portal from which julius gates comes out gates demanding the orb grabs craddock while hawkman takes the orb from him the portal vanishes with craddock and gates inside causing them both to disappear along with the apparitions and zombies hawkman drops the mortis orb somewhere in antarctica to keep it from falling into the wrong hands again 14 sometime later craddock takes up residence in a new hampshire called duskhaven which he operates out of while he robs wealthy socialites of gotham when the midnight shift apprehends him he reveals his new origins some time in the past craddock was a philanderer and drew the ire of a witch who cursed him granting his abilities but forcing him to commit criminal acts he believed the curse would be lifted once the witch died it was not and he found himself to be immortal 11 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 when sebastian faust goes rogue and steals all the magical items in a r g u s storage amanda waller recruits craddock into a special magic based team of criminals known as suicide squad black 15 powers and abilities edit the gentleman ghost of earth two seemed to rely on devices to simulate a ghostly existence the original 1940s stories left the question of his nature open to speculation later he is retconned into a true ghost and his abilities altered to follow suit as a ghost craddock has several abilities he can become intangible and pass effortlessly through solid material he can become completely invisible in fact the appearance of his head as a floating hat and monocle is actually him rendering his decayed face invisible he has been shown as being able to teleport as short a distance as a few rooms or as far as across states gentleman ghost can also summon spectral weapons including a cane that shoots spectral fire and flintlock pistols when passing through craddock s ghostly form people will sometimes experience an intense feeling of cold since this does not happen every time it would seem that he can control this effect craddock can apparently track psionic energy and travel across dimensions as he did when he followed an astral tether from the wizard to johnny sorrow on certain occasions most of the manifestations of his abilities like teleportation and phasing are accompanied by a purple glow of spectral energy or transparent mist possibly courtesy of different pencilers around the time of his prophesied return to life he gains the power to summon and control the spirits of the dead due to his mother s spirit spending centuries recruiting them to help her son it is unknown if he can still call upon them the gentleman ghost is apparently unable to touch or be touched by virgins this is confirmed by his inability to do harm to both stargirl and jakeem thunder however he can pick up a real weapon and be able to hurt them as when he brandished the cosmic rod as a supernatural being gentleman ghost cannot be killed and is very hard to hurt but those with royal blood can physically harm him and when unaware energy hitting him causes pain other versions edit kingdom come edit in the kingdom come

the strait of messina the idiom between scylla and charybdis has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly dangerous situations contents 1 description 2 family 3 mythology 3 1 origin 3

red and charybdis on the opposite shores the sea monster charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel opposite her was scylla another sea monster that lived inside a much larger rock 1 the sides of the strait were within an arrow shot of each other and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other to be between scylla and charybdis therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers the task being to find a route that avoids both three times a day charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water before belching it back out again creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater in some variations of the story charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster through the descriptions of greek mythical chroniclers and greek historians such as thucydides modern scholars generally agree that charybdis was said to have been located in the strait of messina off the coast of sicily and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with scylla 2 a whirlpool does exist there caused by currents meeting but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions 3 family edit a later myth makes charybdis the daughter of poseidon and gaia 4 5 and living as a loyal servant to her father the narrowest point of strait of messina as seen from the village of torre faro mythology edit origin edit charybdis aided her father poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle zeus and as such helped him engulf lands and islands in water zeus angry over the land she stole from him captured and chained her to the sea bed charybdis was then cursed by the god and transformed into a hideous bladder of a monster with flippers for arms and legs and an uncontrollable thirst for the sea as such she drank the water from the sea thrice a day to quench it which created whirlpools 6 7 she lingered on a rock with scylla facing her directly on another rock making a strait in some myths charybdis was a voracious woman who stole oxen from heracles and was hurled by the thunderbolt of zeus into the sea where she retained her voracious nature 5 the odyssey edit a 19th century engraving of the strait of messina the site associated with scylla and charybdis odysseus faced both charybdis and scylla while rowing through a narrow channel he ordered his men to avoid charybdis thus forcing them to pass near scylla which resulted in the deaths of six of his men later stranded on a raft odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near charybdis his raft was sucked into her maw but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair on the next outflow of water when his raft was expelled odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely 8 jason and the argonauts edit the argonauts were able to avoid both dangers because hera ordered the nereid nymph thetis achilles mother to guide them through the perilous passage 9 the aeneid edit in the aeneid the trojans are warned by helenus of scylla and charybdis and are advised to avoid them by sailing around pachynus point cape passero rather than risk the strait 10 later however they find themselves passing etna and have to row for their lives to escape charybdis 11 aesop edit aristotle mentions in his meteorologica that aesop once teased a ferryman by telling him a myth concerning charybdis with one gulp of the sea she brought the mountains to view islands appeared after the next the third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood 12 see also edit icefalls

accomplish his magic he first appeared starring in his own story zatara master magician by writer and artist fred guardineer in the anthology american comic book series action comics starting with the first issue june 1938 1 according to writer al sulman the time came when fred guardineer didn t want to draw the zatara series anymore so the editor turned it over to my brother joe sulman and he began to draw the strip but he had to imitate fred guardineer s drawing style because the character had to look the same and it worked out fine 2 fictional character biography edit john zatara is introduced as a magician in various publications of dc comics beginning with 1938 s action comics 1 which also contains the first appearance of superman like the very similar mandrake the magician zatara had a large east indian as a friend bodyguard called tong to share his early adventures 3 as well as being an illusionist zatara also had genuine magical powers decades later ascribed to being a descendant of the homo magi which he focused through speaking backwards he could do anything so long as he could describe it in sdrawkcab hceeps backwards speech 4 this helped distinguish zatara from the numerous mandrake the magician knockoffs that cluttered the comics and pulp magazines of the day although merlin the magician quality comics also had this attribute and it was also given to

saturnian terror and moon men 5 his love of magic began early when he was given a magic kit by his uncle himself a professional illusionist although he began learning the craft in childhood his early

command to a mannequin to begin waving an arm wildly zatara realized that he could command it to stop by giving the order in backwards spelling with this new knowledge zatara developed a successful show during the premiere performance a fire broke out on stage forcing zatara to use his command of real magic to put it out while the audience mistook the incident as part of the act zatara realized that this power could be invaluable in helping people and he resolved to use it as such between shows 7 zatara became good friends with thomas wayne his excursions with wayne led to wayne meeting his

killer active in the impoverished districts in and around whitechapel in the east end of london in 1888 in both criminal case files and the contemporary journalistic accounts the killer was called the whitechapel murderer and leather apron attacks ascribed to jack the ripper typically involved female prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the east end of london their throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations the removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge rumours that the murders were connected intensified in september and october 1888 and numerous letters were received by media outlets and scotland yard from individuals purporting to be the murderer the name jack the ripper originated in a letter written by an individual claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media the letter is widely believed to have been a hoax and may have been written by journalists to heighten interest in the story and increase their newspapers circulation the from hell letter received by george lusk of the whitechapel vigilance committee came with half of a preserved human kidney purportedly taken from one of the victims the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer known as jack the ripper mainly because of both the extraordinarily brutal nature of the murders and media coverage of the crimes extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the ripper and the legend solidified a police investigation into a series of eleven brutal murders committed in whitechapel and spitalfields between 1888 and 1891 was unable to connect all the killings conclusively to the murders of 1888 five victims mary ann nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride catherine eddowes and mary jane kelly are known as the canonical five and their murders between 31 august and 9 november 1888 are often

lodging houses close to where jack the ripper murdered two of his victims 1 in the mid 19th century britain experienced an influx of irish immigrants who swelled the populations of the major cities including the east end of london from 1882 jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in tsarist russia and other areas of eastern europe emigrated into the same area 2 the parish of whitechapel in london s east end became increasingly overcrowded with the population increasing to approximately 80 000 inhabitants by 1888 3 work and housing conditions worsened and a significant economic underclass developed 4 fifty five percent of children born in the east end died before they were five years old 5 robbery violence and alcohol dependency were commonplace 3 and the endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution to survive on a daily basis 6 in october 1888 london s metropolitan police service estimated that there were 62 brothels and 1 200 women working as prostitutes in whitechapel 7 with approximately 8 500 people residing in the 233 common lodging houses within whitechapel every night 3 with the nightly price for a single bed being fourpence 8 and the cost of sleeping upon a lean to hang over rope stretched across the dormitory being two pence per person 9 the economic problems in whitechapel were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions between 1886 and 1889 frequent demonstrations led to police intervention and public unrest such as bloody sunday 1887 10 anti semitism crime nativism racism social disturbance and severe deprivation influenced public perceptions that whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality 11 such perceptions were strengthened in the autumn of 1888 when the series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to jack the ripper received unprecedented coverage in the media 12 murders main article whitechapel murders the sites of the first seven whitechapel murders osborn street centre right george yard centre left hanbury street top buck s row far right berner street bottom right mitre square bottom left and dorset street middle left the large number of attacks against women in the east end during this time adds uncertainty to how many victims were murdered by the same individual 13 eleven separate murders stretching from 3 april 1888 to 13 february 1891 were included in a london metropolitan police service investigation and were known collectively in the police docket as the whitechapel murders 14 15 opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit but five of the eleven whitechapel murders known as the canonical five are widely believed to be the work of the ripper 16 most experts point to deep slash wounds to the throat followed by extensive abdominal and genital area mutilation the removal of internal organs and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of the ripper s modus operandi 17 the first two cases in the whitechapel murders file those of emma elizabeth smith and martha tabram are not included in the canonical five 18 smith was robbed and sexually assaulted in osborn street whitechapel at approximately 1 30 a m on 3 april 1888 she had been bludgeoned about the face and received a cut to her ear 19 a blunt object was also inserted into her vagina rupturing her peritoneum she developed peritonitis and died the following day at london hospital 20 smith stated that she had been attacked by two or three men one of whom she described as a teenager 21 this attack was linked to the later murders by the press 22 but most authors attribute smith s murder to general east end gang violence unrelated to the ripper case 14 23 24 tabram was murdered on a staircase landing in george yard whitechapel on 7 august 1888 25 she had suffered 39 stab wounds to her throat lungs heart liver spleen stomach and abdomen with additional knife wounds inflicted to her breasts and vagina 26 all but one of tabram s wounds had been inflicted with a bladed instrument such as a penknife and with one possible exception all the wounds had been inflicted by a right handed individual 25 tabram had not been raped 27 the savagery of this murder the lack of an obvious motive and the closeness of the location and date to the later canonical ripper murders led police to link this murder to those later committed by jack the ripper 28 however this murder differs from the later canonical murders because although tabram had been repeatedly stabbed she had not suffered any slash wounds to her throat or abdomen 29 many experts do not connect tabram s murder with the later murders because of this difference in the wound pattern 30 canonical five the canonical five ripper victims are mary ann nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride catherine eddowes and mary jane kelly 31 the body of mary ann nichols was discovered at about 3 40 a m on friday 31 august 1888 in buck s row now durward street whitechapel nichols had last been seen alive approximately one hour before the discovery of her body by a mrs emily holland with whom she had previously shared a bed at a common lodging house in thrawl street spitalfields walking in the direction of whitechapel road 32 her throat was severed by two deep cuts one of which completely severed all the tissue down to the vertebrae 33 her vagina had been stabbed twice 34 and the lower part of her abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep jagged wound causing her bowels to protrude 35 several other incisions inflicted to both sides of her abdomen had also been caused by the same knife each of these wounds had been inflicted in a downward thrusting manner 36 29 hanbury street the door through which annie chapman and her murderer walked to the yard where her body was discovered is beneath the numerals of the property sign one week later on saturday 8 september 1888 the body of annie chapman was discovered at approximately 6 a m near the steps to the doorway of the back yard of 29 hanbury street spitalfields as in the case of mary ann nichols the throat was severed by two deep cuts 37 her abdomen had been cut entirely open with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh plus her small intestines being removed and placed above her right shoulder 38 chapman s autopsy also revealed that her uterus and sections of her bladder and vagina 39 had been removed 40 at the inquest into chapman s murder elizabeth long described having seen chapman standing outside 29 hanbury street at about 5 30 a m 41 in the company of a dark haired man wearing a brown deer stalker hat and dark overcoat and of a shabby genteel appearance 42 according to this eyewitness the man had asked chapman the question will you to which chapman had replied yes 43 elizabeth stride and catherine eddowes were both killed in the early morning hours of sunday 30 september 1888 stride s body was discovered at approximately 1 a m in dutfield s yard off berner street now henriques street in whitechapel 44 the cause of death was a single clear cut incision measuring six inches across her neck which had severed her left carotid artery and her trachea before terminating beneath her right jaw 45 the absence of any further mutilations to her body has led to uncertainty as to whether stride s murder was committed by the ripper or whether he was interrupted during the attack 46 several witnesses later informed police they had seen stride in the company of a man in or close to berner street on the evening of 29 september and in the early hours of 30 september 47 but each gave differing descriptions some said that her companion was fair others dark some said that he was shabbily dressed others well dressed 48 contemporary police drawing of the body of catherine eddowes as discovered in mitre square eddowes s body was found in a corner of mitre square in the city of london three quarters of an hour after the discovery of the body of elizabeth stride 49 her throat was severed from ear to ear and her abdomen ripped open by a long deep and jagged wound before her intestines had been placed over her right shoulder with a section of intestine being completely detached and placed between her body and left arm 50 the left kidney and the major part of eddowes s uterus had been removed and her face had been disfigured with her nose severed her cheek slashed and cuts measuring a quarter of an inch and a half an inch respectively vertically incised through each of her eyelids 51 a triangular incision the apex of which pointed towards eddowes s eye had also been carved upon each of her cheeks 52 and a section of the auricle and lobe of her right ear was later recovered from her clothing 53 the police surgeon who conducted the post mortem upon eddowes s body stated his opinion these mutilations would have taken at least five minutes to complete 54 a local cigarette salesman named joseph lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder and he described seeing a fair haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been eddowes 55 lawende s companions were unable to confirm his description 55 the murders of stride and eddowes ultimately became known as the double event 56 57 a section of eddowes s bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in goulston street whitechapel at 2 55 a m 58 a chalk inscription upon the wall directly above this piece of apron read the juwes are the men that will not be blamed for nothing 59 this graffito became known as the goulston street graffito the message appeared to imply that a jew or jews in general were responsible for the series of murders but it is unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer on dropping the section of apron or was merely incidental and nothing to do with the case 60 such graffiti were commonplace in whitechapel police commissioner charles warren feared that the graffito might spark anti semitic riots and ordered the writing washed away before dawn 61 62 the extensively mutilated and disembowelled body of mary jane kelly was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 miller s court off dorset street spitalfields at 10 45 a m on friday 9 november 1888 63 her face had been hacked beyond all recognition 64 with her throat severed down to the spine and the abdomen almost emptied of its organs 65 her uterus kidneys and one breast had been placed beneath her head and other viscera from her body placed beside her foot 66 about the bed and sections of her abdomen and thighs upon a bedside table the heart was missing from the crime scene 67 multiple ashes found within the fireplace at 13 miller s court suggested kelly s murderer had burned several combustible items to illuminate the single room as he mutilated her body a recent fire had been severe enough to melt the solder between a kettle and its spout which had fallen into the grate of the fireplace 68 official police photograph of the body of mary jane kelly as discovered in 13 miller s court spitalfields 9 november 1888 each of the canonical five murders was perpetrated at night on or close to a weekend either at the end of a month or a week or so after 69 the mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded except for that of stride whose attacker may have been interrupted 70 nichols was not missing any organs chapman s uterus and sections of her bladder and vagina were taken eddowes had her uterus and left kidney removed and her face mutilated and kelly s body was extensively eviscerated with her face gashed in all directions and the tissue of her neck being severed to the bone although the heart was the sole body organ missing from this crime scene 71 historically the belief these five canonical murders were committed by the same perpetrator is derived from contemporary documents which link them together to the exclusion of others 72 in 1894 sir melville macnaghten assistant chief constable of the metropolitan police service and head of the criminal investigation department cid wrote a report that stated the whitechapel murderer had 5 victims 5 victims only 73 similarly the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by police surgeon thomas bond to robert anderson head of the london cid on 10 november 1888 74 some researchers have posited that some of the murders were undoubtedly the work of a single killer but an unknown larger number of killers acting independently were responsible for the other crimes 75 authors stewart p evans and donald rumbelow argue that the canonical five is a ripper myth and that three cases nichols chapman and eddowes can be definitely linked to the same perpetrator but that less certainty exists as to whether stride and kelly were also murdered by the same individual 76 conversely others suppose that the six murders between tabram and kelly were the work of a single killer 17 dr percy clark assistant to the examining pathologist george bagster phillips linked only three of the murders and thought that the others were perpetrated by weak minded individual s induced to emulate the crime 77 macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects 78 later whitechapel murders mary jane kelly is generally considered to be the ripper s final victim and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit s death imprisonment institutionalisation or emigration 23 the whitechapel murders file details another four murders that occurred after the canonical five those of rose mylett alice mckenzie the pinchin street torso and frances coles 25 79 the strangled body of 26 year old rose mylett 80 was found in clarke s yard high street poplar on 20 december 1888 81 there was no sign of a struggle and the police believed that she had either accidentally hanged herself with her collar while in a drunken stupor or committed suicide 82 however faint markings left by a cord on one side of her neck suggested mylett had been strangled 83 84 at the inquest into mylett s death the jury returned a verdict of murder 82 alice mckenzie was murdered shortly after midnight on 17 july 1889 in castle alley whitechapel she had suffered two stab wounds to her neck and her left carotid artery had been severed several minor bruises and cuts were found on her body which also bore a seven inch long superficial wound extending from her left breast to her navel 85 one of the examining pathologists thomas bond believed this to be a ripper murder though his colleague george bagster phillips who had examined the bodies of three previous victims disagreed 86 opinions among writers are also divided between those who suspect mckenzie s murderer copied the modus operandi of jack the ripper to deflect suspicion from himself 87 and those who ascribe this murder to jack the ripper 88 the pinchin street torso was a decomposing headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman aged between 30 and 40 discovered beneath a railway arch in pinchin street whitechapel on 10 september 1889 89 bruising about the victim s back hip and arm indicated the decedent had been extensively beaten shortly before her death the victim s abdomen was also extensively mutilated although her genitals had not been wounded 90 she appeared to have been killed approximately one day prior to the discovery of her torso 91 the dismembered sections of the body are believed to have been transported to the railway arch hidden under an old chemise 92 frances coles was found with her throat cut under a railway arch in whitechapel on 13 february 1891 93 at 2 15 a m on 13 february 1891 pc ernest thompson discovered a 25 year old prostitute named frances coles lying beneath a railway arch at swallow gardens whitechapel 94 her throat had been deeply cut but her body was not mutilated leading some to believe thompson had disturbed her assailant coles was still alive although she died before medical help could arrive 95 a 53 year old stoker james thomas sadler had earlier been seen drinking with coles 96 and the two are known to have argued approximately three hours before her death sadler was arrested by the police and charged with her murder he was briefly thought to be the ripper 97 but was later discharged from court for lack of evidence on 3 march 1891 97 other alleged victims in addition to the eleven whitechapel murders commentators have linked other attacks to the ripper in the case of fairy fay it is unclear whether this attack was real or fabricated as a part of ripper lore 98 fairy fay was a nickname given to an unidentified 99 woman whose body was allegedly found in a doorway close to commercial road on 26 december 1887 100 after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen 101 102 but there were no recorded murders in whitechapel at or around christmas 1887 103 fairy fay seems to have been created through a confused press report of the murder of emma elizabeth smith who had a stick or other blunt object shoved into her vagina 104 most authors agree that the victim fairy fay never existed 98 99 a 38 year old widow named annie millwood was admitted to the whitechapel workhouse infirmary with numerous stab wounds to her legs and lower torso on 25 february 1888 105 informing staff she had been attacked with a clasp knife by an unknown man 106 she was later discharged but died from apparently natural causes on 31 march 99 millwood was later postulated to be the ripper s first victim although this attack cannot be definitively linked to the perpetrator 107 another suspected precanonical victim was a young dressmaker named ada wilson 108 who reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck with a clasp knife 109 upon the doorstep of her home in bow on 28 march 1888 110 a further possible victim 40 year old annie farmer resided at the same lodging house as martha tabram 111 and reported an attack on 21 november 1888 she had received a superficial cut to her throat although an unknown man with blood on his mouth and hands had run out of this lodging house shouting look at what she has done before two eyewitnesses heard farmer scream 112 her wound was light and possibly self inflicted 113 114 the whitehall mystery was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 2 october 1888 in the basement of the new metropolitan police headquarters being built in whitehall an arm and shoulder belonging to the body were previously discovered floating in the river thames near pimlico on 11 september and the left leg was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found on 17 october 115 the other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified the mutilations were similar to those in the pinchin street torso case where the legs and head were severed but not the arms 116 the whitehall mystery of october 1888 both the whitehall mystery and the pinchin street case may have been part of a series of murders known as the thames mysteries committed by a single serial killer dubbed the torso killer 117 it is debatable whether jack the ripper and the torso killer were the same person or separate serial killers active in the same area 117 the modus operandi of the torso killer differed from that of the ripper and police at the time discounted any connection between the two 118 only one of the four victims linked to the torso killer elizabeth jackson was ever identified jackson was a 24 year old prostitute from chelsea whose various body parts were collected from the river thames over a three week period between 31 may and 25 june 1889 119 120 on 29 december 1888 the body of a seven year old boy named john gill was found in a stable block in manningham bradford 121 gill had been missing since 27 december his legs had been severed his abdomen opened his intestines partly drawn out and his heart and one ear removed similarities with the ripper murders led to press speculation that the ripper had killed him 122 the boy s employer 23 year old milkman william barrett was twice arrested for the murder but was released due to insufficient evidence 122 no one was ever prosecuted 122 carrie brown nicknamed shakespeare reportedly for her habit of quoting shakespeare s sonnets was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 24 april 1891 in new york city 123 her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back no organs were removed from the scene though an ovary was found upon the bed either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged 123 at the time the murder was compared to those in whitechapel though the metropolitan police eventually ruled out any connection 123 investigation inspector frederick abberline the vast majority of the city of london police files relating to their investigation into the whitechapel murders were destroyed in the blitz 124 the surviving metropolitan police files allow a detailed view of investigative procedures in the victorian era 125 a large team of policemen conducted house to house inquiries throughout whitechapel forensic material was collected and examined suspects were identified traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry modern police work follows the same pattern 125 more than 2 000 people were interviewed upwards of 300 people were investigated and 80 people were detained 126 following the murders of stride and eddowes the commissioner of the city police sir james fraser offered a reward of 500 for the arrest of the ripper 127 the investigation was initially conducted by the metropolitan police whitechapel h division criminal investigation department cid headed by detective inspector edmund reid after the murder of nichols detective inspectors frederick abberline henry moore and walter andrews were sent from central office at scotland yard to assist the city of london police were involved under detective inspector james mcwilliam after the eddowes murder which occurred within the city of london 128 the overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the cid robert anderson was on leave in switzerland between 7 september and 6 october during the time when chapman stride and eddowes were killed 129 this prompted metropolitan police commissioner sir charles warren to appoint chief inspector donald swanson to coordinate the enquiry from scotland yard 130 butchers slaughterers surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations a surviving note from major henry smith acting commissioner of the city police indicates that the alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry 131 a report from inspector swanson to the home office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months 132 some contemporary figures including queen victoria thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between london and mainland europe whitechapel was close to the london docks 133 and usually such boats docked on thursday or friday and departed on saturday or sunday 134 the cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat s movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out 135 blind man s buff punch cartoon by john tenniel 22 september 1888 criticising the police s alleged incompetence the failure of the police to capture the killer reinforced the attitude held by radicals that the police were inept and mismanaged 136 whitechapel vigilance committee in september 1888 a group of volunteer citizens in london s east end formed the whitechapel vigilance committee they patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters partly because of dissatisfaction with the failure of police to apprehend the perpetrator and also because some members were concerned that the murders were affecting businesses in the area 137 the committee petitioned the government to raise a reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer offered their own reward of 50 then a substantial sum for information leading to his capture 138 and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently 139 criminal profiling at the end of october robert anderson asked police surgeon thomas bond to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer s surgical skill and knowledge 140 the opinion offered by bond on the character of the whitechapel murderer is the earliest surviving offender profile 141 bond s assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders 74 he wrote all five murders no doubt were committed by the same hand in the first four the throats appear to have been cut from left to right in the last case owing to the extensive mutilation it is impossible to say in what direction the fatal cut was made but arterial blood was found on the wall in splashes close to where the woman s head must have been lying all the circumstances surrounding the murders lead me to form the opinion that the women must have been lying down when murdered and in every case the throat was first cut 74 bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge or even the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer 74 in his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits subject to periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating satyriasis 74 bond also stated that the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind or that religious mania may have been the original disease but i do not think either hypothesis is likely 74 there is no evidence the perpetrator engaged in sexual activity with any of the victims 17 142 yet psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks 17 143 this view is challenged by others who dismiss such hypotheses as insupportable supposition 144 in addition to the contradictions and unreliability of contemporary accounts attempts to identify the murderer are hampered by the lack of any surviving forensic evidence 145 dna analysis on extant letters is inconclusive 146 the available material has been handled many times and is too contaminated to provide meaningful results 147 there have been mutually incompatible claims that dna evidence points conclusively to two different suspects and the methodology of both has also been criticised 148 suspects main article jack the ripper suspects speculation as to the identity of jack the ripper cover of the 21 september 1889 issue of puck magazine by cartoonist tom merry the concentration of the killings around weekends and public holidays and within a short distance of each other has indicated to many that the ripper was in regular employment and lived locally 149 others have opined that the killer was an educated upper class man possibly a doctor or an aristocrat who ventured into whitechapel from a more well to do area 150 such theories draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession a mistrust of modern science or the exploitation of the poor by the rich 151 the term ripperology was coined to describe the study and analysis of the ripper case in an effort to determine his identity and the murders have inspired numerous works of fiction 152 suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents as well as many famous names who were never considered in the police investigation including a member of the british royal family 153 an artist and a physician 154 everyone alive at the time is now long dead and modern authors are free to accuse anyone without any need for any supporting historical evidence 155 suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in sir melville macnaghten s 1894 memorandum but the evidence against each of these individuals is at best circumstantial 156 there are many varied theories about the actual identity and profession of jack the ripper but authorities are not agreed upon any of them and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred 157 158 despite continued interest in the case the ripper s identity remains unknown 159 letters jack the ripper letters dear boss letter saucy jacky postcard from hell letter openshaw letter vte over the course of the whitechapel murders the police newspapers and other individuals received hundreds of letters regarding the case 160 some letters were well intentioned offers of advice as to how to catch the killer but the vast majority were either hoaxes or generally useless 161 162 hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself 163 and three of these in particular are prominent the dear boss letter the saucy jacky postcard and the from hell letter 164 the dear boss letter dated 25 september and postmarked 27 september 1888 was received that day by the central news agency and was forwarded to scotland yard on 29 september 165 initially it was considered a hoax but when eddowes was found three days after the letter s postmark with a section of one ear obliquely cut from her body the promise of the author to clip the ladys sic ears off gained attention 166 eddowes s ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack and the letter writer s threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out 167 the name jack the ripper was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication 168 most of the letters that followed copied this letter s tone 169 with some authors adopting pseudonyms such as george of the high rip gang 170 and jack sheridan the ripper 171 some sources claim that another letter dated 17 september 1888 was the first to use the name jack the ripper 172 but most experts believe that this was a fake inserted into police records in the 20th century 173 the from hell letter the saucy jacky postcard was postmarked 1 october 1888 and was received the same day by the central news agency the handwriting was similar to the dear boss letter 174 and mentioned the canonical murders committed on 30 september which the author refers to by writing double event this time 175 it has been argued that the postcard was posted before the murders were publicised making it unlikely that a crank would hold such knowledge of the crime 176 however it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings occurred long after details of the murders were known and publicised by journalists and had become general community gossip by the residents of whitechapel 175 177 the from hell letter was received by george lusk leader of the whitechapel vigilance committee on 16 october 1888 178 the handwriting and style is unlike that of the dear boss letter and saucy jacky postcard 179 the letter came with a small box in which lusk discovered half of a human kidney preserved in spirits of wine ethanol 179 eddowes s left kidney had been removed by the killer the writer claimed that he fried and ate the missing kidney half there is disagreement over the kidney some contend that it belonged to eddowes while others argue that it was a macabre practical joke 180 181 the kidney was examined by dr thomas openshaw of the london hospital who determined that it was human and from the left side but contrary to false newspaper reports he could not determine any other biological characteristics 182 openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed jack the ripper 183 scotland yard published facsimiles of the dear boss letter and the postcard on 3 october in the ultimately vain hope that a member of the public would recognise the handwriting 184 charles warren explained in a letter to godfrey lushington permanent under secretary of state for the home department i think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try ascertain the writer in any case 185 on 7 october 1888 george r sims in the sunday newspaper referee implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high 186 police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the dear boss letter and the postcard 187 the journalist was identified as tom bullen in a letter from chief inspector john littlechild to george r sims dated 23 september 1913 188 a journalist named fred best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he and a colleague at the star had written the letters signed jack the ripper to heighten interest in the murders and keep the business alive 189 media 8 september 1888 edition of the penny illustrated paper depicting the discovery of the body of the first canonical ripper victim mary ann nichols the ripper murders mark an important watershed in the treatment of crime by journalists 23 190 jack the ripper was not the first serial killer but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy 23 190 the elementary education act 1880 which had extended upon a previous act made school attendance compulsory regardless of class as such by 1888 more working class people in england and wales were literate 191 tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with a wider circulation 192 these mushroomed in the later victorian era to include mass circulation newspapers costing as little as a halfpenny along with popular magazines such as the illustrated police news which made the ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity 193 consequently at the height of the investigation over one million copies 194 of newspapers with extensive coverage devoted to the whitechapel murders were sold each day 195 however many of the articles were sensationalistic and speculative and false information was regularly printed as fact 196 in addition several articles speculating as to the identity of the ripper alluded to local xenophobic rumours that the perpetrator was either jewish or foreign 197 198 in early september six days after the murder of mary ann nichols the manchester guardian reported whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret it is believed their attention is particularly directed to a notorious character known as leather apron 199 journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the cid to reveal details of their investigation to the public and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity 23 200 imaginative descriptions of leather apron appeared in the press 201 but rival journalists dismissed these as a mythical outgrowth of the reporter s fancy 202 john pizer a local jew who made footwear from leather was known by the name leather apron 203 and was arrested even though the investigating inspector reported that at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him 204 he was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis 203 after the publication of the dear boss letter jack the ripper supplanted leather apron as the name adopted by the press and public to describe the killer 205 the name jack was already used to describe another fabled london attacker spring heeled jack who supposedly leapt over walls to strike at his victims and escape as quickly as he came 206 the invention and adoption of a nickname for a particular killer became standard media practice with examples such as the axeman of new orleans the boston strangler and the beltway sniper examples derived from jack the ripper include the french ripper the düsseldorf ripper the camden ripper the blackout ripper jack the stripper the yorkshire ripper and the rostov ripper sensational press reports combined with the fact that no one was ever convicted of the murders have confused scholarly analysis and created a legend that casts a shadow over later serial killers 207 legacy the nemesis of neglect jack the ripper depicted as a phantom stalking whitechapel and as an embodiment of social neglect in a punch cartoon of 1888 the nature of the ripper murders and the impoverished lifestyle of the victims 208 drew attention to the poor living conditions in the east end 209 and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded insanitary slums 210 in the two decades after the murders the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished 211 but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the ripper is still promoted by various guided tours of the murder sites and other locations pertaining to the case 212 for many years the ten bells public house in commercial street which had been frequented by at least one of the canonical ripper victims was the focus of such tours 213 in the immediate aftermath of the murders and later jack the ripper became the children s bogey man 214 depictions were often phantasmic or monstrous in the 1920s and 1930s he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret preying on his unsuspecting victims atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay 215 by the 1960s the ripper had become the symbol of a predatory aristocracy 215 and was more often portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman the establishment as a whole became the villain with the ripper acting as a manifestation of upper class exploitation 216 the image of the ripper merged with or borrowed symbols from horror stories such as dracula s cloak or victor frankenstein s organ harvest 217 the fictional world of the ripper can fuse with multiple genres ranging from sherlock holmes to japanese erotic horror 218 jack the ripper features in hundreds of works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction including the ripper letters and a hoax diary the diary of jack the ripper 219 the ripper appears in novels short stories poems comic books games songs plays operas television programmes and films more than 100 non fiction works deal exclusively with the jack the ripper murders making this case one of the most written about in the true crime genre 157 the term ripperology was coined by colin wilson in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs 220 221 the periodicals ripperana ripperologist and ripper notes publish their research 222 in 2006 a bbc history magazine poll selected jack the ripper as the worst briton in history 223 224 in 2015 the jack the ripper museum opened in east london it attracted criticism from both tower hamlets mayor john biggs 225 and protestors 226 similar protests occurred in 2021 when the second of two jack the chipper fish and chip shops opened in greenwich with some patrons threatening to boycott the premises 227 see

from a previous battle with aquaman during the recent crisis the dweller confusing this new arthur for aquaman and calling him his charge tells arthur and king shark of a prophecy regarding arthur s future a prophecy which seems to be a distorted version of the original aquaman s history the dweller reveals that the original aquaman was transformed into one akin to a great and terrible enemy of your people and became the vessel of power strange ancient and terrible arthur s first trip to atlantis and the oceans causes him to meet many of aquaman s supporting characters including mera the sea

kryptonite superman and batman journey deep below the sea where they find a large amount of the substance the two of them are met with hostility by aquaman and king shark a brief fight ensues but

part human to understand that 78 joseph curry would continue to be the stand in king of atlantis until after the final crisis storyline it was revealed that joseph had stepped down from his position due to being unable to deal with the pressure of carrying on the aquaman legacy tempest later finds joseph s trident and costume draped over a throne confirming that he had abandoned his duties as atlantis king 79 this is the final real reference to arthur joseph curry with the character never appearing again or being referenced in any dc material since that point the character has yet to reappear after two of dc comics major relaunches 2011 s the new 52 and 2016 s dc rebirth powers and abilities edit marine telepathy edit aquaman s most widely recognized power is the ability to communicate with marine life which he can summon from great distances this was originally described in the stories as an ability to actually speak with fish in a similar manner to dr dolittle s ability to speak to animals 80 this portrayal of his powers was later retconned into the ability to communicate with them telepathically he once stated that this power more relied on encouraging and compelling the subject rather than full control citing piranha as a species he has trouble commanding under any circumstances due to their ruthlessness and hunger in the new 52 onwards aquaman s telepathy abilities changed acknowledging that most marine life does not possess enough intelligence to carry on a meaningful telepathic communication aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum 64 it is later revealed during drowned earth event that arthur s ability to speak with the ocean comes from a metaphysical energy known as the life force 81 a vast ocean of genesistic power which enables him to connect with any and all forms of sentience within the cosmos even from across realities 82 through it arthur could also use its power to revert lost forms and assert varying consciousnesses within like making the human shell of mother salt s monster daughter the cailleach subservient to her human host s will even restoring the true forms and divine powers of long forgotten ocean gods while calling out to them through his aquatelepathy 83 physical abilities edit the character has a number of other superhuman powers most of which derive from the fact that he is adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of underwater environments he has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough to withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire 84 aquaman frequently displays feats of super atlantean the average atlantean can lift press approximately two tons and superhuman strength while not on par with superman and wonder woman he has proven capable of leaps up to six miles 85 he can swim at extremely high speeds capable of reaching speeds of 3 000 meters per second 84 10 800 km roughly 6 700 miles per hour and can swim up niagara falls 86 he can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing granting limited sonar 2 although aquaman can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects he grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods originally when batman invented aquaman s water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a dehumidifier 2 this weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011 establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his atlantean heritage 87 but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments such as deserts 88 aquaman had also been bestowed an ability he never showcased before given to him by an old sea monarch granting him the ability of unaided flight using his own power 89 other powers and abilities edit while typically able to mostly telepathically commune with marine animals aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea e g sea eagles or even any being evolved from marine life e g humans and some aliens pre flashpoint aquaman has had an ill defined level of telekinetic capability he would use every so often it s very very rarely touched upon and the only times he ever used it few and far between often applying these abilities as a focus for team battles to strengthen combo attacks with other supers 90 at various times in his life aquaman has been transformed into a purely oceanic entity with power over all the seas of the world 91 this was usually temporary as he would often revert to normal afterwards 92 93 94 weapons and equipment edit trident of neptune edit before the new 52 the trident granted by poseidon to the rightful ruler and protector of the seas was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon which aquaman wielded with unmatched skill apart from its power as a melee weapon the trident also had the power to manipulate water fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others most notably tempest 95 in the new 52 the trident of neptune also called atlan s trident or the trident of atlan is a weapon in which is part of a collection of seven very powerful atlantean magical items forged by the first king of atlantis who calls himself the dead king 96 initially thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set with the possible exception of the recently discovered seventh item the trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents such as the evil new god darkseid in one instance the trident was shown glowing with magical power when black manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one sometimes when arthur utilizes the trident of neptunee s supernatural powers his eyes glow with arcane power and this further strengthens his abilities as well as giving him various arcane energy based capabilitie 97 trident of poseidon edit in the new 52 onwards the trident in which is usually the favored weapon of poseidon was given to aquaman by the sea god 98 poseidon s trident has displayed the power to summon tsunamis and deluges 99 and call down thunder and lightning 100 project and control ice move landmasses and grant the ability for aquaman to teleport himself across global and even interplanetary distances using water as a medium 101 it can also transform into a gladius a type of sword used by ancient roman gladiators and back into a trident at will 102 prosthetic hand edit after the loss of his left hand aquaman initially replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook then a liquid metal hand the mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water his biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in blackest night 8 waterbearer hand edit a magical hand made out of water it was given given to him by the lady of the lake which granted aquaman numerous abilities these included the ability to instantly dehydrate to death anyone he touched shoot jets of scalding or freezing water from it healing abilities the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions that could act as spontaneous transport control and negate magic manipulate almost any body of water he sets his focus on 2 and the capability to communicate with the lady of the lake 103 other versions edit earth two edit in the 1960s following the establishment of dc comics s multiverse system 104

kaliszthe savage hawkmansunny ghoguy major hawkman is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in american comic books published by dc comics created by writer gardner fox and artist dennis neville the original hawkman first appeared in flash comics 1 published by all american publications in 1940 several incarnations of hawkman have appeared in dc comics all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and by large artificial wings attached to a harness made from the special nth metal that allows flight most incarnations of hawkman work closely with a partner romantic interest named hawkgirl or hawkwoman hawkman is most often depicted as human archaeologist carter hall the modern day reincarnation of an ancient egyptian prince named khufu or as thanagarian police officer katar hol from the planet thanagar the character is generally regarded as having one of the most confusing backstories of any in dc comics due to a series of reinventions over the years following dc s 1985 series crisis on infinite earths some writers have attempted to integrate carter hall and katar hol into one story by linking the thanagarian aliens to the egyptian curse that causes hawkman to reincarnate periodically throughout human history or by using carter hall as katar hol s alias or otherwise depicting the merger of carter and katar into one being the character has been adapted into other media numerous times with significant appearances in the animated justice league unlimited cartoon which featured hawkgirl as a main character as well as several dc universe original animated movies in live action the character first appeared onscreen in the two part 1979 tv special legends of the superheroes by bill nuckols appearing alongside adam west and burt ward as allies batman and robin hawkman was later portrayed by michael shanks in smallville and by falk hentschel in the cw s arrowverse family of shows with both versions favoring the ancient egyptian version of the character hawkman made his cinematic debut and portrayed by aldis hodge in 2022 s black adam set in the dc extended universe contents 1 publication history 2 fictional character

1 1940 and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s this hawkman was carter hall a reincarnation of the ancient egyptian prince khufu hall discovered that the mysterious ninth metal later changed simply to nth metal could negate the effects of gravity and allow him to fly he donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter hawkman he also had a companion hawk named big red that assisted him in fighting crime an archaeologist by profession hall used ancient weapons from the museum that he curated the golden age hawkman from flash comics 71 may 1946 art by joe kubert hawkman was a charter member of the justice society of america beginning with all star comics 3 winter 1940 in issue 8 he became the jsa s chairman a position he held until the end of the jsa s run in all star comics in 1951 he was the only member of the jsa to appear in every adventure during the golden age of comic books he romanced his reincarnated bride shiera saunders who became the crimefighter hawkgirl his first three adventures were drawn by creator dennis neville who modeled hawkman s costume on the hawkmen characters in the flash gordon comic strip by alex raymond then by sheldon moldoff and later by joe kubert who slightly redesigned his mask in flash comics 85 jul 1947 and then one year later replaced the winged hawk like mask with a much simpler yellow cowl in flash comics 98 aug 1948 along with most other superheroes hawkman s golden age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early 1950s his last appearance was in all star comics 57 1951 later in the decade dc comics under editor julius schwartz decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations but retaining the same names and powers following the success of the flash and green lantern hawkman was revived in the brave and the bold 34 feb mar 1961 this time as an alien police officer from the planet thanagar though his powers were largely the same created by gardner fox and joe kubert this hawkman named katar hol came to earth with his wife shayera in pursuit of a criminal and decided to remain on earth to study earth police methods as well as fight crime they adopted the names carter and shiera hall and became curators of a museum in midway city this hawkman became a member of the justice league of america in issue 31 where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic liberal hero green arrow in the 1960s it was revealed that the original hawkman lived on the parallel world of earth two and that katar hol lived on earth one the jla and jsa had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and 1970s during which the two heroes often met the silver age hawkman and hawkgirl from hawkman 3 august september 1964 art by murphy anderson the silver age hawkman had his own series for a few years in the 60s but with declining sales it ended at issue 27 and was then merged with that of the atom atom and hawkman lasted only another year or so before cancellation in the late 1970s in showcase and world s finest comics thanagar went to war with the planet rann the adopted home of adam strange this led to hawkman and hawkwoman severing ties with their homeworld and later fighting the shadow war of hawkman written by tony isabella as the thanagarians tried secretly to conquer the earth the landmark 1985 series crisis on infinite earths resulted in a massive revision of much of dc continuity and led to many characters being substantially rewritten hawkman was to suffer some of the greatest confusion as successive writers sought to explain his various appearances in the revised timeline there was a single earth which had witnessed the jsa in the 1940s and the jla decades later successive revisions sought to establish exactly who had been hawkman and hawkwoman at different stages for the first few years the pre crisis incarnations were still used during which time they were prominent across the dc universe and joined the latest incarnation of the justice league dc decided to reboot hawkman in a limited series which later led to an ongoing series titled hawkworld originally by tim truman and later john ostrander in this series thanagar was a stratified society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself katar hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo he and his partner shayera were sent to earth and remained there for some years until hol was apparently killed this created several continuity errors because the new katar hol had only just arrived on earth someone else had to have been hawkman previously in an attempt to resolve the problem it was established through retcons that the golden age hawkman and hawkgirl had continued to operate sporadically after their supposed retirement in 1951 through the 1990s and that nth metal originally came from thanagar the halls and not the hols joined the original incarnation of the jla another hawkman fel andar a thanagarian agent had been the one who joined the justice league during the 1980s pretending to be a hero but secretly spying on the league for his thanagarian masters the zero hour miniseries muddied the waters further by merging the different hawkmen into a hawkgod who was the focus character in the third volume of the monthly hawkman series this version of hawkman also had a small role in the alternate future series kingdom come after the end of this series hawkman s continuity was considered by dc to be too complicated citation needed and he was absent from comics for several years in the late 1990s the jsa series untangled hawkman s continuity establishing him as carter hall a man who along with shiera had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient egypt and whose powers were derived from thanagarian nth metal which had been retroactively renamed from ninth metal the katar hol of the hawkworld series had also come to earth during the 1990s as previously established the 1980s hawkman fel andar returned to thanagar the hawkgod was later revealed to be an avatar of the hawk aspect of the red from which animal man receives his powers and only believed that he was hawkman citation needed during the identity crisis miniseries it was established that hawkman carter hall had encouraged the mindwipe of doctor light and had actually been the one to initially suggest the idea his role in the mindwipe was the basis for his enmity with green arrow who felt that interfering with an individual s right to self determination was beyond the moral right of any organization or government subsequently hawkman was reincarnated and given a new series in 2002 entitled hawkman vol 4 written initially by james robinson and geoff johns with art by rags morales justin gray and jimmy palmiotti took over writing duties during the third year of the series in 2006 the series was retitled hawkgirl with issue 50 and given a new creative team of walt simonson and howard chaykin this series was cancelled with issue 66 in july 2007 hawkman was a major character in the rann thanagar war miniseries which stemmed from events in countdown to infinite crisis during this time his continuity was further changed see carter hall section below the character then received a new series spinning out of dark nights metal helmed by robert venditti and bryan hitch 2 fictional character biographies edit carter hall edit main article hawkman carter hall in the days of ancient egypt prince khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival the egyptian priest hath set the priest eventually captures both khufu and his consort chay ara and kills them using a cursed dagger of nth metal millennia later in 1940 khufu is reincarnated as american archaeologist carter hall chay ara as shiera saunders and hath set as scientist anton hastor after touching the same nth metal dagger used to kill khufu carter regains the memories of his former life and realizes hastor is the reincarnation of his ancient foe when hastor kidnaps shiera using a magic spell to draw her to his lair hall uses his newly refound memories to craft a gravity defying belt using nth metal and a winged costume to become hawkman carter successfully rescues shiera anton is killed by electrocution and carter and saunders begin a romantic relationship carter hall and shiera saunders had a son together named hector hall who grew up to also have a superheroic identity as silver scarab and later adopted the mantle of dr fate hector hall was a member of the superhero groups infinity inc and the jsa where he served alongside his father katar hol edit main article hawkman katar hol katar hol is an honored police officer on his homeworld of thanagar along with his wife shayera they use the anti gravity belts and their wings to fly and fight criminals these were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals the pair were sent to earth in 1961 to capture the shape shifting criminal byth following this mission they elected to remain on earth to work with authorities in the united states and learn human police methods the two adopted covers as a pair of museum curators carter and shiera hall and acted publicly as the second hawkman and the second hawkgirl later hawkwoman although initially depicted as surviving the crisis on infinite earths intact katar hol was rebooted just a few years afterwards in a prestige format miniseries named hawkworld by timothy truman a regular ongoing series of the same name followed with writer john ostrander joining truman katar hol a young police officer on the planet thanagar rebels against the oppressive system of his planet and is sent into exile he later escapes and uncovers a renegade police captain byth as a result he is reinstated into the force given a new partner shayera thal and sent on a mission on earth where he is the third hawkman in dc s the new 52 universe hawkman is katar hol but uses the name carter hall fel andar edit main article hawkman fel andar late in the 1980s thanagarian spy fel andar who had been living on earth for some time already fell in love with an earth woman sharon parker and they had a son named charley andar was ordered by the thanagarian government to infiltrate the justice league and parker s memories were altered so that she believed she was hawkwoman and believed that her son was carter hall jr instead of andar s son charley andar later took up the name hawkman to honor his father whom he believed to be carter hall when parker s old memories surface she exposed andar s infiltration plot andar murdered her and fled to thanagar andar later returned to earth to help his son become the hero known as golden eagle and saved his life once before being recaptured and returned to thanagar zauriel edit main article zauriel when grant morrison revived the jla comic book in 1997 they expanded the roster to include over a dozen heroes with frequent collaborator mark millar they intended to create a new hawkman with no links to the old characters this new hawkman an earth bound angel of the eagle host named zauriel was to be introduced into the jla with issue 6 june 1997 morrison was denied permission to use the name hawkman by dc editorial which still considered it radioactive due to the complex post crisis continuity problems with the character in the wizard jla special morrison made an appeal to the fanbase it s a good name and it seems a shame to let it go to waste we re hoping that fans will figure for god s sake let s just call him hawkman and get him in the justice league as hawkman and the editors will relent we re hoping to start a campaign dc held firm and the hawkman name went unused for several more years 3 charley parker edit main article golden eagle comics originally the teen titans member called golden eagle charley parker was presumed deceased after an attack by the wildebeest society during the event known as titans hunt he was later revealed to be alive in the fourth volume of hawkman and went on to assist the carter hall hawkman for some time when carter hall seemingly perished charley parker took on the mantle and became the fourth hawkman and revealed himself as the son of carter hall in fact he was actually the son of fel andar and had been responsible for carter s troubles and his apparent demise carter hall eventually defeated the golden eagle their vendetta was later dropped and carter hall reclaimed his mantle powers and abilities edit all incarnations of hawkman used the fictional enth metal or nth metal to defy gravity and allow them to fly the metal is in their costume s belt boots and wings its abilities are controlled mentally their wings allow them to control their flight though they can be flapped through use of shoulder motions in most comic books hawkman is known to have slightly enhanced physical strength the golden age hawkman was also granted the ability to breathe underwater by the sea god poseidon 4 he also discovered a hidden kingdom of sentient birds led by the old one eye who taught him their language and later sacrificed himself to save hawkman s life 5 among the leading birds was a hawk named big red who became a companion and even helped the golden age hawkman solve crimes 6 the silver age hawkman also had enhanced senses comparable to a hawk s he and sometimes the golden age hawkman as well were also able to converse with birds though they could not command them in the same way that say aquaman could command sea creatures hawkman also wore special contact lenses that allowed him to detect beams and radiation 7 the silver age hawkman also possessed a thanagarian police space ship and a variety of science fiction weapons all versions of hawkman prefer to use archaic weaponry particularly maces nets spears and shields rather than modern or futuristic weapons the current incarnation prefers this in part because having the memories of having lived through many past lives he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons in katar hol s case it was too dangerous to use thanagarian weaponry since there was too great a chance they could be lost or captured and then used or duplicated on earth there is however one significantly unique weapon carter employs occasionally the claw of horus constructed of nth metal by prince khufu in ancient egypt it was delivered to the newly resurrected carter hall by the time displaced jay garrick in jsa book 3 the return of hawkman later in superman batman book 1 public enemies hawkman used it to defeat superman using its nth metal to channel the earth s gravitational field as he explained to superman essentially i just hit you with the planet all versions of hawkman have shown enhanced levels of strength the golden age hawkman was said to have the strength of 12 men but later that idea was dropped where as the golden age hawkman s strength appeared natural it was later explained with the silver age hawkman that the nth metal enables its wielders to carry great weights the recent incarnation has interpreted this as the nth metal simply enhancing the strength of the user also several jla and jsa stories indicate that thanagar has greater gravity than earth and that thanagarians are naturally stronger than humans because they are adapted to it similarly to how atlanteans e g aquaman are adapted to deep sea pressures it has also been explained in the jsa series that the nth metal greatly aids in healing closing wounds almost instantaneously one example is in the jla story crisis of conscience in issues 115 118 when carter s arm is nearly severed during one part of the issue but the wound has obviously closed and functionality returned by the end of the issue the atom has commented that hawkman laughs at anything less than third degree burns the nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes it also has the property of radiating heat which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates 8 other versions edit during the chronal disruptions of zero hour multiple versions of hawkman and hawkgirl hawkwoman from alternate timelines were appearing in and out of existence it turns out the hawks were one of many anomalies in the timestream resulting from the crisis somehow the various versions were converged into the current reality s katar hol a hawkman evolved from robin in the just imagine comic book 9 this version was a humanoid hawk similar to northwind hawkman s anti matter earth counterpart is blood eagle he was killed by the crime syndicate 10 it is unclear whether he is a thanagarian like katar hol or a human like carter hall awards edit the series and character have won several awards over the years including 1961 alley award for best adventure hero heroine not in own book 1962 alley award for best hero 1963 alley award for cross over of dc heroes the brave and the bold with the flash reception edit hawkman was
