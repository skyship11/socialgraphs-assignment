physician expert physicist neal emerson and his brother john were raised by an abusive father although a later flashback shows him raised by an abusive aunt this apparently drove neal emerson within himself and led to the creation of the personification of his own dark side 3 emerson left the united states for a year and returned to find he was an uncle his brother john and sister in law katherine had adopted a baby and named him grant emerson was not around much for his nephew over the years but he was quite fond of the boy as a medical student neal emerson develops a fanatical interest in magnets despite the teasing of his classmates emerson is convinced exposure to magnetic fields will give him more energy he later holds crowd drawing lectures on health via magnetism due to his medical background and belief in magnetism emerson adopts the name doctor polaris he even designs a special costume and mask to wear for his public appearances 3 after time emerson came to believe he had absorbed too much magnetic energy and unsuccessfully tries to drain off the excess energy in desperation emerson tries to make a public appeal at a charity event to green lantern believing green lantern s power ring can help him on his unfortune putting on the costume causes the evil persona of doctor polaris to take over emerson and he robs the box office of the proceeds instead 3 polaris tries to draw a magnetic gun on green lantern but is knocked unconscious by the lantern instead at the hospital green lantern probes polaris mind and learns of emerson s evil side shortly thereafter polaris recovers and attacks green lantern from hiding with girders and other metal objects the green lantern manages to draw polaris out into the open and defeat him doctor polaris is remanded to police custody during that time his good self resurfaces 4 doctor polaris apparently returns to battle green lantern and the justice league alongside killer moth dagon the mask and the pied piper but it is later revealed the demons three abnegazar rath and ghast had created magical duplicates of the villains the league even has to battle the villains costumes before ultimately defeating the demons three doctor polaris was later released from imprisonment during one of his good periods he attempted to discover the source of green lantern s power by kidnapping his friend tom kalmaku polaris learned green lantern s power battery was hidden at ferris aircraft and was able to put a magnetic barrier around it which prevented green lantern from fully charging his ring the hero tracked kalmaku to polaris lair as his power ring ran out of energy polaris turned his weapon on the green lantern apparently killing him the emerald gladiator s body disappeared what doctor polaris did not know was that green lantern was taken to oa home of the guardians of the universe the masters of the green lantern corps due to the magnetic effect of polaris weapon they believed jordan was dead to complicate matters further jordan was taken into the 58th century where he battled a threat to the earth in the fictional identity of pol manning returning to the 20th century green lantern defeated polaris after reviving him jordan revealed to kalmaku the good nature of neal emerson had lessened the effect of doctor polaris weapon thereby saving the ring wielder a reformed emerson traveled to the earth s magnetic north pole to study it emerson was at the point where the lines of magnetic force converge when an earthquake plunged him into a deep crevice at the bottom of the crevice lay a glowing blue blob the radiation from the blob altered emerson s perceptions allowing him to understand the blob s intentions to dehydrate the entire earth emerson was able to subconsciously influence hal jordan into becoming green lantern but was unable to bring the lantern to the north pole in desperation emerson created a mental duplicate of his evil alter ego doctor polaris took advantage of the situation and attacked green lantern by blocking his power battery with a magnetic barrier doctor polaris flew into earth s orbit to increase the solar radiation reaching the planet as he left the earth s magnetic field the barrier around the power ring faded allowing green lantern to recover green lantern managed to use micrometeorites to form an iron mask around polaris head blocking off his vision back on earth emerson was able to use telepathy to warn green lantern of the alien threat once green lantern disintegrated the blob the mental image of the evil doctor polaris faded away years later emerson s dark side returns returning to his old costume polaris takes the name of baxter timmons and moves to metropolis suicide slum where he steals advanced technology from warehouses throughout the city polaris integrates the new magnetic circuits into his costume as part of an attempt to gain revenge on green lantern polaris plans are stopped through the efforts of the superhero black lightning over the years the polaris and emerson personalities fought for dominance until polaris was approached by the demon neron polaris sold neron emerson s soul in exchange for greater power and being rid of the other restraining side of his personality polaris was one of neron s lieutenants before being betrayed by lex luthor and the joker 5 polaris later attacks steel in washington d c seeking a weapon called the annihilator that steel had built during the battle steel s grandmother attacks polaris and is killed polaris is driven away after the parasite attacks him afraid of absorbing polaris s mind and not just his power parasite lets him go before killing him polaris flees to keystone city 6 some time after that polaris shows up at poseidonis in an attempt to seize control of the city prompting a battle against aquaman and his allies at that same time maxima is in the city trying to force aquaman to marry her using her powerful mental abilities maxima compels polaris into believing that his alternate personality has reemerged forcing him into a nearly catatonic state under unknown circumstances the catatonic polaris ends up being held in iraq but he is rescued by hatchet heat wave and sonar the trio planned to carry him to the aurora borealis in the magnetic north pole for recharge thinking that he would be thankful to them and would lead them they fought the flash green arrow and green lantern when polaris recovers the flash gives him a bit of his speed which has the same effect as applying kinetic energy to a magnet doctor polaris body attracts the remains of the sunken aurora borealis containing him 7 8 9 in 2001 polaris emerges during the joker s last laugh crisis attempting to take control of the magnetic south pole itself forcing a battle against the justice league where the league only just manage to defeat him thanks to the actions of plastic man the only league member with no metal on him whatsoever at the end of last laugh the slab metahuman prison is moved to antarctica as polaris now is the magnetic pole and cannot be moved shortly thereafter polaris appears in san francisco allied with the villainous cadre here he is utilizing the power of one of the unimaginably powerful alien controllers as well as cadre member black mass the latter keeping polaris magnetic powers in check so that he can move from the slab this time doctor polaris has an altruistic goal in sight convinced that civilization and humanity s free will are obstacles for creating a better earth he plans to use the controller s power and some stolen s t a r labs equipment to focus his powers and cleanse the world the heroes known as the power company defeat polaris by turning the brain damaged black mass against his master and use his gravitational powers to drain polaris on power shortly before the infinite crisis storyline dr polaris appears in metropolis seeking superman s help in battling a more powerful and ruthless magnetism manipulator who calls herself repulse it eventually transpires that this is a new manifestation of his personality disorder polaris is hallucinating repulse who looks like the aunt who hated him and performs her actions himself eventually superman forces him to accept she is not real after recovering from this breakdown polaris is recruited by lex luthor s secret society of super villains in villains united dr polaris is one of the villains waiting to ambush the freedom fighters in a warehouse south of metropolis in the beginning of infinite crisis when

known as agent orange to those who wield power from the emotional spectrum is the first and for a long time the only individual to wield the power of the orange light little is known about his past except that he comes from an incredibly long lived species as larfleeze is said to be over several billion years old he was taken from his parents for reasons yet to be revealed and forced to work as a slave his time as a slave was cruel and harsh his cruel and sadistic masters starved larfleeze and his fellow slaves in order to weed out those too weak to work in the hellish conditions they were forced to toil in this cruelty and deprivation of even the most basic rights and privileges deeply affected larfleeze who at some point began to hear the material possessions in the society of the people whom he served begging him to own them some time much later larfleeze escaped and became a wanted criminal along with several of his species billions of years ago larfleeze belonged to a small guild of thieves which stole a number of artifacts from the planet maltus including a mysterious box supposedly worth an entire star system to the right buyer in retaliation the guardians of the universe sent their manhunters to pursue them those that escaped discovered a map belonging to the guardian krona that told of treasure the guild followed the map into the vega system to the planet okaara there they discovered a temple inside of which was a power battery containing the orange light of avarice feeling its power speak to them the criminals fought amongst themselves for it eventually the guardians and their manhunters found them however because of its proximity to larfleeze and the others the guardians could not get within reaching distance of the box the guardians and manhunters who tried were incinerated by the orange light of avarice fearing the power of the orange light the guardians offered the two surviving guild members larfleeze and turpa a deal in exchange for the mysterious box the guardians would trade the orange light with two additional conditions first as long as the orange light remained within the vega system the guardians would agree not to interfere with it then secondly for the safety of others only one of the two thieves would be allowed to keep the orange light for themselves larfleeze explained that the guardians were desperate to get the box back because it contained the fear entity parallax agreeing to these terms the two guild members fought to the death for the right to own the orange light and larfleeze emerged victorious 8 agent orange edit in green lantern vol 4 issue 28 april 2009 the controllers are shown discussing their previous failures in forming a force matching the green lantern corps they soon became interested in pursuing a comparable power source to the green light that they ve discovered the orange light 9 the controllers follow the orange light to okaara where they descend into an underground palace and eventually come across the orange lantern power battery deep inside as soon as they try to take it the controllers are overcome by larfleeze s orange lanterns and are slaughtered 10 larfleeze is enraged at this perceived violation of the agreement he has with the guardians as he is unable to see a distinction between them and the controllers at the time green lantern stel pursues a member of the sinestro corps but is given pause when he crosses into the vega system for sanctuary not willing to be stopped despite the fact that green lanterns are barred from entering the system stel continues after his target upon entering the system the sinestro corps member is devoured by agent orange s construct of blume blume captures and seriously damages stel branding him with the symbol of the orange lantern corps when the green lanterns recover stel and return him to oa a construct of larfleeze bursts forth from the brand and confronts the guardians about the attempt to steal the orange battery although the guardians point out that the controllers are the source of his anger larfleeze refuses to listen he declares the treaty is null and void and that the guardians will submit to his demands or face his wrath in response the guardian scar destroys the projection and states that the guardians do not negotiate with terrorists 10 this conflict marks the beginning of green lantern s next phase in its prelude to the blackest night crossover titled agent orange the story goes on to show the guardians adding a fourth law to the book of oa the vega system is no longer outside of green lantern jurisdiction this allows the guardians and the green lantern corps to begin an assault on vega hal jordan a new recipient of a blue power ring created by ganthet and sayd is included in the assault team upon arriving on okaara the green lanterns are met with opposition from larfleeze s orange lantern constructs they are alarmed to find that their green light powers have little effect on the orange lanterns and are absorbed into them gretti a nomadic green lantern is slain and his form is taken into larfleeze s service during the fight jordan is separated from the group and comes face to face with agent orange larfleeze upon seeing jordan s blue ring immediately wants it for himself 11 larfleeze touches the ring in his desire for it and is forced back by the power of the blue light the ring itself claiming that hope is selfless this enrages larfleeze who bargains with jordan over it though jordan agrees to give the ring to larfleeze he finds he is unable to remove it not finding this to be an acceptable answer larfleeze creates an axe from orange light and seemingly removes jordan s hand by force no longer attached to jordan the blue power ring welcomes larfleeze to the blue lantern corps 8 for a moment the constant hunger he feels as agent orange is pacified however it is quickly revealed that this is a ruse created by the blue ring in response to larfleeze s hope for relief jordan hand actually intact returns to battle larfleeze with the green lantern corps during the battle jordan is possessed by the overwhelming orange power of avarice after briefly seizing larfleeze s power battery assuming that by stealing it larfleeze would no longer be able to power his army of constructs unfortunately it s explained that larfleeze has been in contact with the orange battery for so long that it s as much a part of him as the main power battery in oa is a part of the guardians 12 jordan is able to subdue larfleeze by finally gaining control over his blue power ring the guardians realize that if they take the battery from larfleeze someone else will inevitably find it becoming a new agent orange preferring to know where agent orange is they decide to negotiate with larfleeze once more the details of the negotiation aren t fully revealed however it is shown that larfleeze asks the guardians where he can find a blue power ring the issue ends with larfleeze launching an assault on the blue lantern corps by sending a group of his orange lantern constructs to odym 12 though larfleeze remains on okaara observing the progress of the conflict through his central power battery he sends a construct of himself to accompany his orange lanterns 13 14 blackest night edit main article blackest night at the onset of the blackest night storyline a new corps powered by death rather than a light of the emotional spectrum is introduced to the dc universe the black lantern corps as the other seven corps battle one another black hand releases black power rings that reanimate the deceased in order to recruit members to their ranks in green lantern vol 4 45 larfleeze is shown delighting over his orange lanterns attempting to steal the blue central power battery from odym his celebration is premature however as black power rings invade his chamber and reanimate the bodies of those whose identities he s stolen in order to create his constructs larfleeze responds to this with a simple and timid yuh oh 15 he is next seen fleeing his reanimated orange lanterns distracting him to such a degree that his energy constructs on odym dissipate larfleeze is saved by the timely intervention of atrocitus who demands that larfleeze hand over his power battery 16 the two characters quarrel over the orange central power battery before being overwhelmed again by the reanimated corpses of larfleeze s constructs they re saved by saint walker hal jordan carol ferris indigo 1 and sinestro who have arrived to recruit them both to assist in destroying the black central power battery both antagonists prove difficult to persuade with larfleeze more preoccupied by the other corps having their own guardians in order to secure his compliance sayd agrees to be his personal guardian at the end of the conflict if he cooperates larfleeze agrees and ultimately accompanies the group to earth which becomes the setting for the end of the blackest night event 17 during the events that transpire on earth ganthet duplicates larfleeze s ring to bolster the ranks of the light wielders against nekron s forces the duplicate orange power ring is able to choose someone to become a deputy orange lantern for a 24 hour period though larfleeze protests against anyone else s wielding of the orange light the duplicate ring chooses lex luthor as its wearer 18 despite the immense conflict going on around them the two characters repeatedly clash due to their insatiable greed 19 in the final issue of blackest night luthor is stripped of his power larfleeze hands him over to the heroes of earth in disgust prompting sinestro to point out that this is the first time larfleeze has given anyone anything as promised sayd agrees to become larfleeze s personal guardian when he demands payment for participating in their plan 20 brightest day edit main article brightest day larfleeze later seeks out luthor demanding to know what is important to the people of earth luthor responds with power which larfleeze already possesses and land which larfleeze decides he wants 21 larfleeze is shown to have taken up residence in a small upper midwestern town he sends his orange lanterns into town to steal things for him when hal jordan confronts him and tells him to leave the town alone larfleeze tells him that he won t need to ransack the town anymore because he has learned of the legend of santa claus larfleeze intends to make lists of all the things he wants and send them to santa claus when hal tries to explain to larfleeze that santa claus isn t real larfleeze comments that the mountain of stuff that he has stolen is evidence to the contrary frustrated hal reveals that he has come to larfleeze to find out how he was able to trap the orange entity in his lantern so that they can trap the other entities to keep them out of the hands of the one trying to collect them before larfleeze can tell him hector hammond arrives after struggling with larfleeze and hal for the battery hammond ends up swallowing it this frees ophidian and the entity of avarice takes hammond as its host larfleeze shows a great deal of concern about ophidian s freedom particularly because it seems that ophidian doesn t like him very much 22 the battle with ophidian doesn t go very well for hal or larfleeze while fleeing ophidian larfleeze admits that he wasn t entirely honest about his ownership of the orange lantern and that he and ophidian have a rather antagonistic relationship however he is quick to blame ophidian for starting whatever it was that came between them ophidian states that larfleeze was the only being in the universe capable of resisting his temptations thereby allowing larfleeze to subdue him and become agent orange and that now it s larfleeze s turn to be subdued and used by ophidian ophidian then attempts to devour larfleeze but this is prevented by hal after that the desires of hector hammond begin to override those of ophidian and he leaves to search for his ultimate desire carol ferris hal has to get to las vegas to save carol and larfleeze who is in a state of near hysteria telling hal that he can t live without his lantern demands to come once there larfleeze seems to forget entirely about ophidian and his lost lantern which appears to have had no effect on his ability to spawn orange lanterns and instead revels in the rich culture of las vegas he is stopped by the predator who forces him to experience the sadness of his empty heart briefly causing him to think of his family he is later taken to zamaron by the star sapphires along with hal carol the predator and abraham pointe the man possessed by the predator larfleeze is present when carol is named the new queen of the star sapphires and states that he wants to be queen 23 while watching over pointe larfleeze is shaken to discover that pointe knows of his past through the predator that he was taken from his family and that larfleeze isn t his real name larfleeze almost kills pointe to keep him from speaking his name before returning to earth with the others to meet a young woman who has been possessed by the hope entity adara adara reveals to a shocked larfleeze that she senses the empty void within him larfleeze claims it s his stomach but adara dismisses this saying there is a pit inside him he s been trying to fill for centuries adara goes on to explain that she s here to give him hope saying that his parents are still alive and that they miss him the blue lantern symbol shining in larfleeze s eyes gives the implication that his avaricious tendencies have been somewhat tempered 24 larfleeze christmas special edit writer geoff johns signing a copy of green lantern larfleeze christmas special at midtown comics in manhattan on christmas day larfleeze is outraged to discover that santa claus hasn t brought him anything that he asked for he attacks every costumed santa in the nearby town and tries to melt the north pole only to be stopped by hal jordan jordan tells larfleeze of christmas spirit and how it comes from giving on hal s suggestion larfleeze gives away every item in his mountain of possessions but afterwards declares that he doesn t like christmas spirit jordan then suggests that he look over his christmas list and see if he actually needed anything there that night larfleeze stares at a part of his list on which he had written my family 25 war of the green lanterns edit when krona s attack traps the other six new guardians in the book of the black hal is able to escape with their rings 26 although he initially discouraged john stewart from using the ring due to its psychological effects 27 hal later uses larfleeze s orange ring in conjunction with sinestro s ring to hold off the attacking brainwashed green lanterns long enough for guy gardner to break parallax out of the central power battery and restore their comrades to normal 28 while trapped inside the book of the black larfleeze is forced to relive a childhood memory of slavery 29 larfleeze is later freed from the book by kyle rayner when his orange ring returns to him larfleeze is initially fearful saying keep it away from me once the ring is on his finger however he returns to his usual mindset declaring it mine 29 the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline kyle rayner had apparently become a magnet to the other lantern corps rings which forced kyle to face off with the second in commands from the sinestro corps red lantern corps earth s star sapphires and indigo tribe with the help of saint walker from the blue lantern corps kyle tried to reach oa for some answers but on their way an orange ring approaches kyle with saint walker claiming if there is only one orange ring then its former bearer must be dead 30 however saint walker had not seen that there are multiple orange rings just all inactive as revealed in the prelude to blackest night 11 it is subsequently revealed that kyle s orange ring was actually the glomulus construct posing as a ring when larfleeze appears to attack the guardians 31 claiming that some unknown force attempted to steal his ring and send it to kyle only for larfleeze to send glomulus to investigate when his strong connection to his ring allowed him to retain his hold of it 32 however while investigating the orrery that was apparently responsible for the theft of the rings kyle discovers that the worlds were aware of larfleeze s existence identifying him as the beast 33 with their ruler archangel invictus 34 archangel invictus reveals that larfleeze was responsible for his banishment from the universe centuries ago and seeks revenge 35 although saint walker assumes that larfleeze is responsible for the reach attacking the blue lantern corps 36 larfleeze states that he would never do such a thing as it would involve sharing the pleasure of their defeat munk the indigo tribe representative of the new guardians manages to disrupt larfleeze s constructs by tapping into the orange light when larfleeze attacks the new guardians with the regenerated glomulus actively moving to protect kyle but the team are forced to prioritize when invictus begins to attack the vega system 37 when kyle rayner learned that he needed to master all seven emotions of the spectrum to defeat the rise of the third army he approached larfleeze for aid although larfleeze was initially unwilling to share his power he consented when carol ferris offered to help him find his still living family in return despite this offer larfleeze only consents to give kyle access to his power if kyle can get past him in a fight and recharge from his orange battery although kyle manages to do this while larfleeze is occupied fighting off the attacking third army 38 when larfleeze is captured by volthoom the returned first lantern who sought to wield all powers of the emotional spectrum volthoom attempted to trap larfleeze in various illusionary realities granting his greatest wish including a world where larfleeze never fell victim to the orange light or a world where he successfully stole hal s blue ring but these illusions failed due to the extent of the orange ring s influence on larfleeze 39 following the defeat of the third army and volthoom and the death of the guardians larfleeze agrees to release sayd so that she can return to ganthet sinestro having spared the two of them from the fate of the other guardians so long as they never return to oa he states that larfleeze s reward will be knowledge of the secret of ganthet and sayd s survival in the future the keeper of the corps history states that eventually larfleeze will give away everything he has to regain his family but will return to old habits eventually 40 dc rebirth edit larfleeze was shown in hal jordan and the green lantern corps 10 2016 to be controlling brainiac 2 0 after the latter had managed to trap planet xudar with green and yellow lanterns in it 41 powers and abilities edit main article power ring some of larfleeze s orange power rings larfleeze s exclusively wields the orange light of avarice using his orange power ring and power battery some of his basic abilities are shared with other corps flight aura projection and the ability to create constructs made from light however the most notable and unique aspect of larfleeze s abilities is his power to steal the identities of those he kills after these individuals have died orange light constructs resembling them rise from their corpses adding new members to his orange lanterns the orange lanterns are able to steal the identities of others for larfleeze in the same way the orange light also has the power to absorb green light constructs and mystical energies such as the magicks created by green lantern torquemada 11 conversely it is depicted as being unable to absorb blue or violet light constructs 8 when larfleeze faced the new guardians a team consisting of representatives from all six of the other corps the only lantern able to damage his constructs was munk of the indigo tribe which was only accomplished when munk tapped into the orange light himself 37 larfleeze s power is amplified by being in constant contact with his power battery as a result of this he can maintain an entire corps of constructs even when separated from it 12 his control over his ring is so great that he was the only being able to retain control of his ring when a mysterious external force turned kyle rayner into a ring magnet that caused the rings of one member from each of the other five corps to abandon their wielders and travel to kyle 32 however larfleeze is burdened with insatiable hunger that is never quelled as a side effect of wielding the orange light which can be nullified while in the presence of a blue lantern 8 based on larfleeze s reaction to it after it was removed the orange ring is classified as one of the two parasitic type rings the other is the indigo ring which alters its wielder to match its own alignment rather than choosing users who embody its emotion 29 unlike the indigo ring it appears to need someone who is already somewhat greedy it then amplifies this to a huge degree as shown in larfleeze origin where he kills two of his fellow thieves to gain control of the ring 8 it would appear that unlike the indigo tribe larfleeze retains some awareness while under the ring s influence as he clearly recognized the ring when he was temporarily freed of it while indigo 1 appeared ignorant of what had happened to her when briefly free of his ring larfleeze is terrified of it and begs not to have it returned as soon as the ring is back on his finger his previous mindset returns orange lantern corps edit main article orange lantern corps other versions edit the lightsmith edit in the universe prior to the current one groups

turquoise lord or lord of fire 3 was the god of fire day and heat 4 in historical sources he is called by many names which reflect his varied aspects and dwellings in the three parts of the cosmos 5 he was the lord of volcanoes 6 the personification of life after death warmth in cold fire light in darkness and food during famine he was also named cuezaltzin kʷeˈsaɬt sin flame and ixcozauhqui iʃkoˈsaʍki 7 and is sometimes considered to be the same as huehueteotl old god 8 although xiuhtecuhtli is usually shown as a young deity 9 his wife was chalchiuhtlicue xiuhtecuhtli is sometimes considered to be a manifestation of ometecuhtli the lord of duality and according to the florentine codex xiuhtecuhtli was considered to be the father of the gods 10 who dwelled in the turquoise enclosure in the center of earth 11 xiuhtecuhtli huehueteotl was one of the oldest and most revered of the indigenous pantheon 12 the cult of the god of fire of the year and of turquoise perhaps began as far back as the middle preclassic period 13 turquoise was the symbolic equivalent of fire for aztec priests 14 a small fire was permanently kept alive at the sacred center of every aztec home in honor of xiuhtecuhtli 14 the nahuatl word xihuitl means year as well as turquoise and fire 11 and xiuhtecuhtli was also the god of the year and of time 15 16 the lord of the year concept came from the aztec belief that xiuhtecuhtli was the north star 17 in the 260 day ritual calendar the deity was the patron of the day atl water and with the trecena 1 coatl 1 snake 15 xiuhtecuhtli was also one of the nine lords of the night and ruled the first hour of the night named cipactli alligator 18 scholars have long emphasized that this fire deity also has aquatic qualities 13 xiuhtecuhtli dwelt inside an enclosure of turquoise stones fortifying himself with turquoise bird water 19 he is the god of fire in relation to the cardinal directions just as the brazier for lighting fire is the center of the house or temple 20 xiuhtecuhtli was the patron god of the aztec emperors who were regarded as his living embodiment at their enthronement 21 the deity was also one of the patron gods of the pochteca merchant class 22 stone sculptures of xiuhtecuhtli were ritually buried as offerings and various statuettes have been recovered during excavations at the great temple of tenochtitlan with which he was closely associated 23 statuettes of the deity from the temple depict a seated male with his arms crossed 24 a sacred fire was always kept burning in the temples of xiuhtecuhtli 25 in gratitude for the gift of fire the first mouthful of food from each meal was flung into the hearth 21 xiuhtecuhtli is depicted in the codex borgia 26 contents 1 attributes 2 annual festival 3 new fire ceremony 4 in popular culture 5 see also 6 notes 7 references attributes edit the mask of xiuhtecuhtli from the british museum of aztec or mixtec provenance 9 xiuhtecuhtli s face is painted with black and red pigment 16 xiuhtecuhtli was usually depicted adorned with turquoise mosaic wearing the turquoise xiuhuitzolli crown of rulership on his head and a turquoise butterfly pectoral on his chest 27 and he often wears a descending turquoise xiuhtototl bird cotinga amabilis on his forehead and the xiuhcoatl fire serpent on his back 28 he owns fire serpent earplugs 12 on his head he has a paper crown painted with different colors and motifs on top of the crown there are sprays of green feathers like flames from a fire 12 he has feather tufts to each side like pendants toward his ears on his back he has plumage resembling a dragon s head made of yellow feathers with marine conch shells 12 he has copper bells tied to the insteps of his feet in his left hand he holds a shield with five greenstones called chalchihuites placed in the form of a cross on a thin gold plate that covered almost all the shield 12 in his right hand he has a kind of scepter that was a round gold plate with a hole in the middle and topped by two globes one larger than the other the smaller one had a point 12 xiuhtecuhtli is closely associated with youthful warriors and with rulership and was considered a solar god 29 his principal symbols are the tecpatl flint and the mamalhuatzin the two sticks that were rubbed together to light ceremonial fires 30 a staff with a deer s head was also an attribute of xiuhtecuhtli although not exclusively so as it could also be associated with xochiquetzal and other deities 31 many of the attributes of xiuhtecuhtli are found associated with early postclassic toltec warriors but clear representations of the god are not common until the late postclassic 28 the nahual or spirit form of xiuhtecuhtli is xiuhcoatl the fire serpent 32 xiuhtecuhtli was embodied in the teotecuilli the sacrificial brazier into which sacrificial victims were cast during the new fire ceremony 32 this took place at the end of each cycle of the aztec calendar round every 52 years 33 when the gods were thought to be able to end their covenant with humanity feasts were held in honor of xiuhtecuhtli to keep his favors and human sacrifices were burned after removing their heart annual festival edit the annual festival of xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated in izcalli the 18th veintena of the year 34 the nahuatl word izcalli means stone house and refers to the building where maize used to be dried and roasted between mid january and mid february the whole month was therefore devoted to fire 14 the izcalli rituals grew in importance every four years 35 a framework image of the deity was constructed from wood and was richly finished with clothing feathers and an elaborate mask 34 quails were sacrificed to the idol and their blood spilt before it and copal was burnt in his honour 36 on the day of the festival the priests of xiuhtecuhtli spent the day dancing and singing before their god 37 people caught animals including mammals birds snakes lizards and fish for ten days before the festival in order to throw them into the hearth on the night of the festival 38 on the tenth day of izcalli during a festival called huauhquiltamalcualiztli eating of the amaranth leaf tamales the new fire was lighted signifying the change of the annual cycle and the rebirth of the fire deity 39 during the night the image of the god was lit with using the mamalhuatzin 40 food was consumed ritually including shrimp tamales after first offering it to the god 38 xiuhtecuhtli in his role as one of the lords of the night from the codex borgia 41 every four years a more solemn version of the festival was held at the temple of xiuhtecuhtli in tenochtitlan attended by the emperor and his nobles 42 slaves and captives were dressed as the deity and sacrificed in his honour 43 godparents were assigned to children on this day and the children had their ears ritually pierced after this the children their parents and godparents all shared a meal together 42 new fire ceremony edit xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated often but especially at the end of every 52 year period this was the time the 365 day solar and the 260 day sacred calendars ended on the same day and the aztec celebrated the binding of the years with the new fire ceremony 17 in order to perform the ritual priests marched in solemn procession up the hill of the star on a peninsula near culhuacán to wait for the star yohualtecuhtli either aldebaran in the taurus constellation or the pleiades as a whole to get past its zenith having ascertained this they would tear out the heart of a sacrificial victim and kindle a flame in a small wooden hearth they placed inside the hole left in his chest priests used a drill method to generate this sacred flame it was then carried on pine sticks to light the fires anew in every hearth including the sacred braziers of perpetual fire that numbered over 600 in the capital alone 44 in popular culture edit a set of six postage stamps issued by the royal mail in 2003 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the british museum featured a mask of xiuhtecuhtli alongside other museum objects such as the sutton hoo helmet and hoa hakananai a 45 see also edit xiuhcoatl lords of the night

reach the very love he had abandoned heaven for before her death had been bitterly wandering the earth to seek his aid asmodel adopted the form of a child and mounted an attack on the jla watchtower resulting in the death of the martian manhunter who then aided zauriel in heaven itself from there asmodel and neron led their forces to heaven and actually beat back the armies of paradise slaughtering his way towards the throne room of the presence asmodel found only an abandoned room instead empty except for zauriel confused asmodel demanded to know where the presence was and was informed by zauriel that the presence is in fact everywhere and in everything realizing that there was no true way he could ever succeed where lucifer had failed asmodel turned to neron for help but the demon abandoned the former king angel sentenced to hell yet again asmodel became neron s prisoner the martian manhunter returned to earth when the flash revived him after the object of zauriel s affection decided to stay with her boyfriend heaven assigned zauriel as their ambassador to earth to be a beacon of hope and reassurance he was granted a suit of heavenly armor and a new headquarters the aerie a structure floating over los angeles accepting the jla s offer for membership zauriel joined them on various missions asmodel did not stay beaten for long and soon bonded himself to the hostless spectre in the day of judgement crossover using the ashes of an angel s wing feather aided by etrigan the demon gaining sudden immeasurable power asmodel froze hell and returned to earth leading to immense destruction zauriel confronted and attempted to battle asmodel directly but asmodel effortlessly overpowered him by turning his very wings into stone the heroes of earth united the bulk of which went to fight spectre directly while a smaller detachment led by zauriel left for purgatory to find a soul eligible to replace asmodel s inside the spectre they found hal jordan returning to earth with jordan s soul in tow the group met up with the others and jordan entered the spectre leading to an internal conflict that ultimately forced asmodel out establishing jordan as the spectre zauriel also confronted a version of the spectre in jla 31 stopping him from delivering a death blow to triumph a former superhero turned supervillain spectre told zauriel that his insubordination would not go well for him in the courts of light zauriel s career with the jla continued until the galactic threat known as mageddon arrived whose hate mongering effect motivated lex luthor to join up with prometheus queen bee and general wade eiling a k a the general with the earth facing immediate destruction both from itself and mageddon luthor planted bombs on the watchtower as the jla evacuated zauriel deliberately stayed behind and removed his helmet just before the bombs detonated he was caught in the explosion and died 6 arriving in heaven zauriel discovered that paradise had abandoned all hope for earth s survival and was already designing a replacement world zauriel begged heaven for aid but was turned down they did however grant him the option to return to earth himself and stand by the mortals zauriel accepted and asked the others to listen to the presence in their hearts he was about to leave when countless hosts of angels volunteered to accompany him back to earth and aid in the struggle against mageddon leading his army of angels zauriel returned and prevented the nations of the world from destroying each other while the jla stopped mageddon itself with the mageddon situation resolved a number of league members parted ways with the jla zauriel included he later appeared for a memorial commemorating the end of the modern jla he is still considered a member of the league however to be called upon when needed zauriel appears in other titles generally functioning as a spiritual counselor or guide to other heroes in the pages of jsa he gives advice to hawkgirl about the future and the current status of the souls in her body in the supergirl title he explains the angelic nature of that version of supergirl while assisting her in defeating a demonic invasion of hollywood he serves as a supporting character in the spectre series featuring hal jordan zauriel even bonds with the spectre force itself during an incident where hal deals with an ancient entity who wants to turn earth into a long lost paradise infinite crisis edit zauriel made some cameo appearances during infinite crisis specifically in infinite crisis 5 where he is shown leading a group of heroes in an ecumenical prayer service and in the day of vengeance infinite crisis special in infinite crisis 7 zauriel was hit square in the chest and through his right wing by superboy prime s heat vision zauriel then appears in the first issue of 52 a year long series which chronicles the events following infinite crisis it may indicate that zauriel was injured but recovered or it may be that zauriel returned quickly from death 52 edit in 52 elongated man ralph dibny recruits zauriel along with green lantern hal jordan metamorpho and green arrow oliver queen to infiltrate a resurrection cult supposedly based on kryptonian theology dibny hoped that these four because of their significant experience with the afterlife would be able to judge whether the cult s claims to be able to resurrect his dead wife sue were viable the meeting ends badly the heroes interrupt the ceremony partway through but in the resulting fracas the wicker replica of sue looks up at ralph and calls his name ralph is left temporarily mad cradling the wicker body under a bridge and muttering that they need to try again 7 one year later edit in march 2007 dc published a helmet of fate zauriel one shot written by steve gerber with art by peter snejberg in it zauriel is dragged away from an awkward sunday school question and answer session in order to retrieve the helmet from the planet alstair populated by plant animal hybrids okeontis a vampire like fungus creature plans to use its power to overthrow the tyrant queen hyathis zauriel destroys okeontis and her controlling intelligence and sends the helmet of fate back on its quest for a new keeper 8 zauriel is given the mission to destroy the shadowpact member blue devil who has been demoted to the rank of a rhyming demon in hell s hierarchy 9 the angel abariel told zauriel that blue devil is leading humans to admire and even want to emulate his demonic path and that he must be eliminated despite the fact that as zauriel said this world owes its existence to him more than once zauriel accepted the assignment although he does not relish the task of killing someone he considers a proven hero after getting into a small fight with blue devil he is then convinced to join the shadowpact in the place of blue devil he is given michael s battle spear which is more powerful than his sword as he takes blue devil s place on the team rise of eclipso edit zauriel is recruited by congorilla to be part of a reserve justice league consisting of cyborg doctor light kimiyo hoshi red tornado bulleteer animal man and tasmanian devil to help the jla stop eclipso the reserve league is quickly defeated and zauriel is injured after being stabbed by eclipso 10 zauriel is subsequently tied up and tortured by eclipso who uses the angel s pained screams to lure the new spectre into a fatal trap 11 the new 52 edit in the new 52 zauriel appeared in trinity of sin phantom stranger 9 he warns phantom stranger that he is never allowed to enter heaven again having left to try and save his family zauriel tells phantom stranger that if he tries he will be erased from time and history 12 during the trinity war storyline zauriel appears and dismisses batman katana and deadman after obtaining a piece of doctor light arthur light s soul he returns doctor light to his womb so that heaven will heal him zauriel asks phantom stranger why he risked his being by returning and why he did not tell the group of the consequences with no answer zauriel erases phantom stranger from existence 13 he was later resurrected by the presence because of his desire to help during the forever evil storyline zauriel was with spectre when constantine s group appeared at the border of heaven when the presence shows constantine the rest of the groups understandings constantine then flees making zauriel chase after him they arrive at the house of mystery where constantine traps zauriel in a celestial circle in the hopes that he will help them fight blight he tells the others that the trip was a waste as he only saw why he could not trust any of the group the others however saw the truth or good remaining in their hearts which zauriel confirms as he agrees to help them fight 14 zauriel proceeds to attack blight before being defeated as well he joins phantom stranger and pandora in the collective unconscious as both created the illusion that they died the group finds the human chris located within blight s heart when pandora tries to free him as a way to weaken blight she is stopped by zauriel who tells her and phantom stranger that there are bigger plans for chris zauriel continues to fight a part of blight as phantom stranger and pandora work to help chris 15 powers and abilities edit zauriel s most visible special attribute is his wings which grant him the power of flight at incredible speeds and with a high degree of control as a former angel of heaven zauriel is essentially immortal immune to the usual mortal frailties of aging and disease he apparently does not need food water air or sleep and has endured for millions of years serving paradise the most potent of zauriel s powers is his devastating sonic scream sometimes called a sonic flash which is capable of tremendous amounts of destruction an ability that is specific to angels of the eagle host zauriel s scream is acutely attuned to the vibrational frequency that angels adopt when temporarily descending to the earthly plane enabling zauriel to vaporize an angel in milliseconds a less defined property of zauriel s angel hood is what he refers to as his angelic over mind zauriel s mental connection to heaven this connection grants zauriel various abilities including the ability to communicate with any type of animal and a divine connection to the flow of magic on earth he can also sense good and evil around him and in people zauriel has a number of other powers including enhanced strength durability and agility when compared to a normal human he can perform what he calls the red sea trick enabling him to part a body of water in much the way moses did on more than one occasion he has been submersed in water for long periods without drowning skills and talents edit zauriel has quite a diverse and versatile set of skills zauriel is an incredible swordsman having wielded a flaming sword since the dawn of creation as a guardian angel his role as a leader and a guide are impressive he has led groups into heaven and has served as a guide to various individuals including the present hawkgirl kendra saunders he is an expert in the ancient warfare customs and theologies of the abrahamic religious traditions for example he invoked the beliefs of the gnostic christians when counseling hawkgirl weapons and equipment edit armor edit zauriel has three major pieces of equipment the first is his heavenly armor although built of earthly materials this prototype is designed by the engineers of heaven and is blessed with divine properties that are theoretically impossible to replicate on earth without omniscience this suit of armor greatly enhances zauriel s physical capabilities including strength durability foot speed agility flight speed and stamina zauriel s sword flaming sword edit zauriel s second piece of equipment is his flaming sword a creation of elemental angelic fire cast in the foundries of the fifth heaven and characteristic of both guardian angels depicted thus far the sword is directly bonded to zauriel s will it is able to emit blasts of holy fire and because it is controlled by zauriel s will the sword can cut through virtually anything including otherwise intangible objects and people and even the very fabric of dimensions zauriel was once able to cut a hole in the dimensional barrier separating heaven and earth when the blade was magically augmented by teammates enabling him and his team to traverse dimensions despite it being a heavenly weapon zauriel s sword can be exhausted of power it has been blown out at least once but was re ignited by one of the powers wielded by the then supergirl the angel abariel later commanded zauriel to surrender this weapon in exchange for an even more powerful weapon michael s battle staff spear the aerie edit zauriel s final piece of equipment is his headquarters itself the aerie floating high over los angeles this shining golden tower is much like zauriel s armor in that it is made of earthly materials but is of heavenly design the equipment far surpasses the technology of humans even going so far as to supersede the technology within the jla watchtower michael s battle staff spear edit the angel abariel after commanding zauriel to surrender his sword gives zauriel this heavenly weapon until such time we may need it back formerly wielded by the archangel michael himself when he joins the shadowpact it is said to be even more capable than the trident of lucifer wielded by blue devil and has great and terrible powers far beyond your sword s meager abilities it is powerful enough to actually wound doctor gotham an enemy of the shadowpact whose mystical powers far surpass those of the vastly potent enchantress other versions edit zauriel is featured in the elseworlds one shot supergirl wings as a friend of matrix who tries to help her he is depicted as a lindel an angel who plans out the lives of human beings before they are born in other media edit miscellaneous edit zauriel has appeared in the justice league unlimited spin off comic book in issues 7 and 14 in issue 14 he is assisted by other mystical heroes such as deadman and doctor occult references edit cowsill alan irvine alex korte steve manning matt wiacek win wilson sven 2016 the dc comics encyclopedia the

1 ultraa pre crisis 1 2 ultraa post crisis 1 3 ultra comics multiversity 2 powers and abilities 3 notes 4 references 5 external links fictional character biography edit ultraa pre crisis edit ultraa s origin was very similar to superman s in that he was born on an alien world and sent to earth to escape its destruction he landed in the australian outback and was raised by indigenous australians in his first appearance ultraa plans to go to the united states of america and become a superhero as he runs across the ocean he is detected by the us air force which sends a plane after him ultraa retaliates to this attack and is mistaken for a villain by the justice league who are visiting from earth one ultraa eventually decides earth prime was not ready for superheroes and accompanies the league back to their world 3 ultraa next appeared following a battle between the league and the injustice gang which threatened civilians deciding earth one was also endangered by the presence of superhumans he uses a ray gun to create a feeling of apathy in both the league and the injustice gang it works on the heroes but has the opposite effect on the villains ultraa attempts to fight the injustice gang single handedly but fails after the jla overcome the ray s effects to defeat the gang they question whether they can trust ultraa any longer 4 as a result of their second encounter with ultraa the league imprisons him in a stasis cube prison of superman s design he is later released by an alien hive mind entity disguised as a human attorney the alien entity helps ultraa take the justice league members who imprisoned him to court for wrongful imprisonment but it is later learned that the trial is meant as a distraction to keep the jla from noticing that the bulk of the hive mind entity known as the over complex was stealing the hydrogen atoms from the world s oceans 5 after this a dispirited ultraa adopts the civilian guise of jack grey and lives a simple life as a busboy in atlantic city where he is manipulated by a down and out former opponent of the justice league but a heart to heart talk with hawkman convinces him to break off the attack and ultraa subsequently decides to live out his life among earth 1 s australian aborigines 6 this is his last pre crisis appearance ultraa post crisis edit following the crisis on infinite earths the original ultraa was retconned out of history along with earth prime in justice league quarterly 13 winter 1993 ultraa is reintroduced as a native of almerac and the betrothed of queen maxima he arrives on earth to look for her and gets into a long and brutal fight with captain atom captain atom briefly gains the upper hand and nearly kills ultraa but then realizes that he himself is behaving as brutally as ultraa and decides to throw the fight in order not to set a poor example that might is right for an onlooking boy ultraa in turn starts beating up captain atom but maxima intervenes and tells him to leave maxima then tells captain atom he can stop pretending he is unconscious and the two walk off together ultraa later appears as a member of the united nations funded league busters in justice league international 65 june 1994 ultra comics multiversity edit in the new 52 earth 33 is introduced in the eighth installment of grant morrison s the multiversity series the multiversity ultra comics 1 as the additional designation for earth prime this earth continues the tradition of having minimal superhero activity in this case the minds of earth 33 s comic book readers have empowered a superhero named ultra comics ultra comics is the only metahuman on that world fighting the encroachment of the gentry the series lead villains by confining their presence on our world to the pages of an entrapment comic book built around the title character of the comic book he is described as a self aware idea a hero created by the memesmiths of earth prime to defend us from the gentry as flesh and blood superhumans don t exist here on earth prime ultra only exists in the form of a cybernetic comic book that is the comic books themselves are his body and he gets his powers from the minds of his readers suggesting that we are empowering and essentially becoming him whenever we read his comic within the story he is depicted as a superhero created in a laboratory and sent out into battle against the gentry eventually facing off against the post crisis version of ultraa 7 powers and abilities edit the original ultraa could not fly but had super speed supersenses and super strength he could run fast enough to pass over large bodies of water this ultraa s only weakness was targeted ultrasonics 3 as a scion of the blood royale of almerac the modern ultraa commands a vast array of powers that come from years of selective breeding and gene therapy like maxima the current ultraa has incredible strength telepathy telekinesis and flight as a narrative construct ultra comics also possessed a vast array superhuman powers all completely fictional and generated by readers ultra comics demonstrated superhuman strength flight and other abilities gifted to him by the ultragem a crystal consisting of pure imagination notes edit the pre crisis version of ultraa was the first superhero to appear on his particular parallel earth the second was superboy prime an alternate version of ultraa from one of the earths in the post infinite crisis universe was killed in countdown arena 1 references edit rovin jeff 1987 the encyclopedia of supervillains new york facts

fusion power this article is about the fusion reaction device for other uses see tokamak disambiguation this article needs to be updated please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information february 2022 the reaction chamber of the diii d an experimental tokamak fusion reactor operated by general atomics in san diego which has been used in research since it was completed in the late 1980s the characteristic torus shaped chamber is clad with graphite to help withstand the extreme heat a tokamak ˈtoʊkəmæk russian токамáк is a device which uses a powerful magnetic field to confine plasma in the shape of a torus the tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices being developed to produce controlled thermonuclear fusion power as of 2016 update it was the leading candidate for a practical fusion reactor 1 tokamaks were initially conceptualized in the 1950s by soviet physicists igor tamm and andrei sakharov inspired by a letter by oleg lavrentiev the first working tokamak was attributed to the work of natan yavlinsky on the t 1 in 1958 2 it had been demonstrated that a stable plasma equilibrium requires magnetic field lines that wind around the torus in a helix devices like the z pinch and stellarator had attempted this but demonstrated serious instabilities it was the development of the concept now known as the safety factor labelled q in mathematical notation that guided tokamak development by arranging the reactor so this critical factor q was always greater than 1 the tokamaks strongly suppressed the instabilities which plagued earlier designs by the mid 1960s the tokamak designs began to show greatly improved performance the initial results were released in 1965 but were ignored lyman spitzer dismissed them out of hand after noting potential problems in their system for measuring temperatures a second set of results was published in 1968 this time claiming performance far in advance of any other machine when these were also met skeptically the soviets invited a delegation from the united kingdom to make their own measurements these confirmed the soviet results and their 1969 publication resulted in a stampede of tokamak construction by the mid 1970s dozens of tokamaks were in use around the world by the late 1970s these machines had reached all of the conditions needed for practical fusion although not at the same time nor in a single reactor with the goal of breakeven a fusion energy gain factor equal to 1 now in sight a new series of machines were designed that would run on a fusion fuel of deuterium and tritium these machines notably the joint european torus jet tokamak fusion test reactor tftr had the explicit goal of reaching breakeven instead these machines demonstrated new problems that limited their performance solving these would require a much larger and more expensive machine beyond the abilities of any one country after an initial agreement between ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev in november 1985 the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter effort emerged and remains the primary international effort to develop practical fusion power many smaller designs and offshoots like the spherical tokamak continue to be used to investigate performance parameters and other issues as of 2020 update jet remains the record holder for fusion output

тороидальная камера с аксиальным магнитным полем toroidal naya kamera s aksial nym magnitnym polem toroidal chamber with axial magnetic field 3 the term was created in 1957 by igor golovin 4 a the vice director of the laboratory of measuring apparatus of academy of science today s kurchatov institute a similar term tokomag was also proposed for a time 6 history edit a ussr stamp 1987 tokamak thermonuclear system first steps edit in 1934 mark oliphant paul harteck and ernest rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on earth using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into metal foil containing deuterium or other atoms 7 this allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions and determined that the deuterium deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions peaking at about 100 000 electronvolts 100 kev 8 b accelerator based fusion is not practical because the reactor cross section is tiny most of the particles in the accelerator will scatter off the fuel not fuse with it these scatterings cause the particles to lose energy to the point where they can no longer undergo fusion the energy put into these particles is thus lost and it is easy to demonstrate this is much more energy than the resulting fusion reactions can release 10 to maintain fusion and produce net energy output the bulk of the fuel must be raised to high temperatures so its atoms are constantly colliding at high speed this gives rise to the name thermonuclear due to the high temperatures needed to bring it about in 1944 enrico fermi calculated the reaction would be self sustaining at about 50 000 000 k at that temperature the rate that energy is given off by the reactions is high enough that they heat the surrounding fuel rapidly enough to maintain the temperature against losses to the environment continuing the reaction 10 during the manhattan project the first practical way to reach these temperatures was created using an atomic bomb in 1944 fermi gave a talk on the physics of fusion in the context of a then hypothetical hydrogen bomb however some thought had already been given to a controlled fusion device and james l tuck and stanislaw ulam had attempted such using shaped charges driving a metal foil infused with deuterium although without success 11 the first attempts to build a practical fusion machine took place in the united kingdom where george paget thomson had selected the pinch effect as a promising technique in 1945 after several failed attempts to gain funding he gave up and asked two graduate students stanley stan w cousins and alan alfred ware 1924 2010 12 to build a device out of surplus radar equipment this was successfully operated in 1948 but showed no clear evidence of fusion and failed to gain the interest of the atomic energy research establishment 13 lavrentiev s letter edit in 1950 oleg lavrentiev then a red army sergeant stationed on sakhalin wrote a letter to the central committee of the communist party of the soviet union the letter outlined the idea of using an atomic bomb to ignite a fusion fuel and then went on to describe a system that used electrostatic fields to contain a hot plasma in a steady state for energy production 14 15 c the letter was sent to andrei sakharov for comment sakharov noted that the author formulates a very important and not necessarily hopeless problem and found his main concern in the arrangement was that the plasma would hit the electrode wires and that wide meshes and a thin current carrying part which will have to reflect almost all incident nuclei back into the reactor in all likelihood this requirement is incompatible with the mechanical strength of the device 14 some indication of the importance given to lavrentiev s letter can be seen in the speed with which it was processed the letter was received by the central committee on 29 july sakharov sent his review in on 18 august by october sakharov and igor tamm had completed the first detailed study of a fusion reactor and they had asked for funding to build it in january 1951 16 magnetic confinement edit when heated to fusion temperatures the electrons in atoms dissociate resulting in a fluid of nuclei and electrons known as plasma unlike electrically neutral atoms a plasma is electrically conductive and can therefore be manipulated by electrical or magnetic fields 17 sakharov s concern about the electrodes led him to consider using magnetic confinement instead of electrostatic in the case of a magnetic field the particles will circle around the lines of force 17 as the particles are moving at high speed their resulting paths look like a helix if one arranges a magnetic field so lines of force are parallel and close together the particles orbiting adjacent lines may collide and fuse 18 such a field can be created in a solenoid a cylinder with magnets wrapped around the outside the combined fields of the magnets create a set of parallel magnetic lines running down the length of the cylinder this arrangement prevents the particles from moving sideways to the wall of the cylinder but it does not prevent them from running out the end the obvious solution to this problem is to bend the cylinder around into a donut shape or torus so that the lines form a series of continual rings in this arrangement the particles circle endlessly 18 sakharov discussed the concept with igor tamm and by the end of october 1950 the two had written a proposal and sent it to igor kurchatov the director of the atomic bomb project within the ussr and his deputy igor golovin 18 however this initial proposal ignored a fundamental problem when arranged along a straight solenoid the external magnets are evenly spaced but when bent around into a torus they are closer together on the inside of the ring than the outside this leads to uneven forces that cause the particles to drift away from their magnetic lines 4 19 during visits to the laboratory of measuring instruments of the ussr academy of sciences lipan the soviet nuclear research centre sakharov suggested two possible solutions to this problem one was to suspend a current carrying ring in the centre of the torus the current in the ring would produce a magnetic field that would mix with the one from the magnets on the outside the resulting field would be twisted into a helix so that any given particle would find itself repeatedly on the outside then inside of the torus the drifts caused by the uneven fields are in opposite directions on the inside and outside so over the course of multiple orbits around the long axis of the torus the opposite drifts would cancel out alternately he suggested using an external magnet to induce a current in the plasma itself instead of a separate metal ring which would have the same effect 4 in january 1951 kurchatov arranged a meeting at lipan to consider sakharov s concepts they found widespread interest and support and in february a report on the topic was forwarded to lavrentiy beria who oversaw the atomic efforts in the ussr for a time nothing was heard back 4 richter and the birth of fusion research edit ronald richter left with juan domingo perón right richter s claims sparked off fusion research around the world on 25 march 1951 argentine president juan perón announced that a former german scientist ronald richter had succeeded in producing fusion at a laboratory scale as part of what is now known as the huemul project scientists around the world were excited by the announcement but soon concluded it was not true simple calculations showed that his experimental setup could not produce enough energy to heat the fusion fuel to the needed temperatures 20 although dismissed by nuclear researchers the widespread news coverage meant politicians were suddenly aware of and receptive to fusion research in the uk thomson was suddenly granted considerable funding over the next months two projects based on the pinch system were up and running 21 in the us lyman spitzer read the huemul story realized it was false and set about designing a machine that would work 22 in may he was awarded 50 000 to begin research on his stellarator concept 23 jim tuck had returned to the uk briefly and saw thomson s pinch machines when he returned to los alamos he also received 50 000 directly from the los alamos budget 24 similar events occurred in the ussr in mid april dmitri efremov of the scientific research institute of electrophysical apparatus stormed into kurchatov s study with a magazine containing a story about richter s work demanding to know why they were beaten by the argentines kurchatov immediately contacted beria with a proposal to set up a separate fusion research laboratory with lev artsimovich as director only days later on 5 may the proposal had been signed by joseph stalin 4 new ideas edit red plasma in east by october sakharov and tamm had completed a much more detailed consideration of their original proposal calling for a device with a major radius of the torus as a whole of 12 metres 39 ft and a minor radius the interior of the cylinder of 2 metres 6 ft 7 in the proposal suggested the system could produce 100 grams 3 5 oz of tritium a day or breed 10 kilograms 22 lb of u233 a day 4 as the idea was further developed it was realized that a current in the plasma could create a field that was strong enough to confine the plasma as well removing the need for the external magnets 5 at this point the soviet researchers had re invented the pinch system being developed in the uk 11 although they had come to this design from a very different starting point once the idea of using the pinch effect for confinement had been proposed a much simpler solution became evident instead of a large toroid one could simply induce the current into a linear tube which could cause the plasma within to collapse down into a filament this had a huge advantage the current in the plasma would heat it through normal resistive heating but this would not heat the plasma to fusion temperatures however as the plasma collapsed the adiabatic process would result in the temperature rising dramatically more than enough for fusion with this development only golovin and natan yavlinsky continued considering the more static toroidal arrangement 5 instability edit on 4 july 1952 nikolai filippov s group measured neutrons being released from a linear pinch machine lev artsimovich demanded that they check everything before concluding fusion had occurred and during these checks they found that the neutrons were not from fusion at all 5 this same linear arrangement had also occurred to researchers in the uk and us and their machines showed the same behaviour but the great secrecy surrounding the type of research meant that none of the groups were aware that others were also working on it let alone having the identical problem 25 after much study it was found that some of the released neutrons were produced by instabilities in the plasma there were two common types of instability the sausage that was seen primarily in linear machines and the kink which was most common in the toroidal machines 25 groups in all three countries began studying the formation of these instabilities and potential ways to address them 26 important contributions to the field were made by martin david kruskal and martin schwarzschild in the us and shafranov in the ussr 27 one idea that came from these studies became known as the stabilized pinch this concept added additional magnets to the outside of the chamber which created a field that would be present in the plasma before the pinch discharge in most concepts the external field was relatively weak and because a plasma is diamagnetic it penetrated only the outer areas of the plasma 25 when the pinch discharge occurred and the plasma quickly contracted this field became frozen in to the resulting filament creating a strong field in its outer layers in the us this was known as giving the plasma a backbone 28 sakharov revisited his original toroidal concepts and came to a slightly different conclusion about how to stabilize the plasma the layout would be the same as the stabilized pinch concept but the role of the two fields would be reversed instead of weak external fields providing stabilization and a strong pinch current responsible for confinement in the new layout the external magnets would be much more powerful in order to provide the majority of confinement while the current would be much smaller and responsible for the stabilizing effect 5 steps toward declassification edit khrushchev roughly centred bald kurchatov to the right bearded and bulganin to the right white haired visited harwell on 26 april 1956 cockcroft stands across from them in glasses while a presenter points to mockups of various materials being tested in the newly opened dido reactor in 1955 with the linear approaches still subject to instability the first toroidal device was built in the ussr tmp was a classic pinch machine similar to models in the uk and us of the same era the vacuum chamber was made of ceramic and the spectra of the discharges showed silica meaning the plasma was not perfectly confined by magnetic field and hitting the walls of the chamber 5 two smaller machines followed using copper shells 6 the conductive shells were intended to help stabilize the plasma but were not completely successful in any of the machines that tried it 29 with progress apparently stalled in 1955 kurchatov called an all union conference of soviet researchers with the ultimate aim of opening up fusion research within the ussr 30 in april 1956 kurchatov travelled to the uk as part of a widely publicized visit by nikita khrushchev and nikolai bulganin he offered to give a talk at atomic energy research establishment at the former raf harwell where he shocked the hosts by presenting a detailed historical overview of the soviet fusion efforts 31 he took time to note in particular the neutrons seen in early machines and warned that neutrons did not mean fusion 32 unknown to kurchatov the british zeta stabilized pinch machine was being built at the far end of the former runway zeta was by far the largest and most powerful fusion machine to date supported by experiments on earlier designs that had been modified to include stabilization zeta intended to produce low levels of fusion reactions this was apparently a great success and in january 1958 they announced the fusion had been achieved in zeta based on the release of neutrons and measurements of the plasma temperature 33 vitaly shafranov and stanislav braginskii examined the news reports and attempted to figure out how it worked one possibility they considered was the use of weak frozen in fields but rejected this believing the fields would not last long enough they then concluded zeta was essentially identical to the devices they had been studying with strong external fields 31 first tokamaks edit by this time soviet researchers had decided to build a larger toroidal machine along the lines suggested by sakharov in particular their design considered one important point found in kruskal s and shafranov s works if the helical path of the particles made them circulate around the plasma s circumference more rapidly than they circulated the long axis of the torus the kink instability would be strongly suppressed 26 today this basic concept is known as the safety factor the ratio of the number of times the particle orbits the major axis compared to the minor axis is denoted q and the kruskal shafranov limit stated that the kink will be suppressed as long as q 1 this path is controlled by the relative strengths of the external magnets compared to the field created by the internal current to have q 1 the external magnets must be much more powerful or alternatively the internal current has to be reduced 26 following this criterion design began on a new reactor t 1 which today is known as the first real tokamak 6 t 1 used both stronger external magnets and a reduced current compared to stabilized pinch machines like zeta the success of the t 1 resulted in its recognition as the first working tokamak 2 34 35 36 for his work on powerful impulse discharges in a gas to obtain unusually high temperatures needed for thermonuclear processes yavlinskii was awarded the lenin prize and the stalin prize in 1958 yavlinskii was already preparing the design of an even larger model later built as t 3 with the apparently successful zeta announcement yavlinskii s concept was viewed very favourably 31 37 details of zeta became public in a series of articles in nature later in january to shafranov s surprise the system did use the frozen in field concept 31 he remained sceptical but a team at the ioffe institute in st petersberg began plans to build a similar machine known as alpha only a few months later in may the zeta team issued a release stating they had not achieved fusion and that they had been misled by erroneous measures of the plasma temperature 38 t 1 began operation at the end of 1958 39 d it demonstrated very high energy losses through radiation this was traced to impurities in the plasma due to the vacuum system causing outgassing from the container materials in order to explore solutions to this problem another small device was constructed t 2 this used an internal liner of corrugated metal that was baked at 550 c 1 022 f to cook off trapped gasses 39 atoms for peace and the doldrums edit as part of the second atoms for peace meeting in geneva in september 1958 the soviet delegation released many papers covering their fusion research among them was a set of initial results on their toroidal machines which at that point had shown nothing of note 40 the star of the show was a large model of spitzer s stellarator which immediately caught the attention of the soviets in contrast to their designs the stellarator produced the required twisted paths in the plasma without driving a current through it using a series of magnets that could operate in the steady state rather than the pulses of the induction system kurchatov began asking yavlinskii to change their t 3 design to a stellarator but they convinced him that the current provided a useful second role in heating something the stellarator lacked 40 at the time of the show the stellarator had suffered a long string of minor problems that were just being solved solving these revealed that the diffusion rate of the plasma was much faster than theory predicted similar problems were seen in all the contemporary designs for one reason or another the stellarator various pinch concepts and the magnetic mirror machines in both the us and ussr all demonstrated problems that limited their confinement times 39 from the first studies of controlled fusion there was a problem lurking in the background during the manhattan project david bohm had been part of the team working on isotopic separation of uranium in the post war era he continued working with plasmas in magnetic fields using basic theory one would expect the plasma to diffuse across the lines of force at a rate inversely proportional to the square of the strength of the field meaning that small increases in force would greatly improve confinement but based on their experiments bohm developed an empirical formula now known as bohm diffusion that suggested the rate was linear with the magnetic force not its square 41 if bohm s formula was correct there was no hope one could build a fusion reactor based on magnetic confinement to confine the plasma at the temperatures needed for fusion the magnetic field would have to be orders of magnitude greater than any known magnet spitzer ascribed the difference between the bohm and classical diffusion rates to turbulence in the plasma 42 and believed the steady fields of the stellarator would not suffer from this problem various experiments at that time suggested the bohm rate did not apply and that the classical formula was correct 41 but by the early 1960s with all of the various designs leaking plasma at a prodigious rate spitzer himself concluded that the bohm scaling was an inherent quality of plasmas and that magnetic confinement would not work 39 the entire field descended into what became known as the doldrums 43 a period of intense pessimism 5 progress in the 1960s edit in contrast to the other designs the experimental tokamaks appeared to be progressing well so well that a minor theoretical problem was now a real concern in the presence of gravity there is a small pressure gradient in the plasma formerly small enough to ignore but now becoming something that had to be addressed this led to the addition of yet another set of magnets in 1962 which produced a vertical field that offset these effects these were a success and by the mid 1960s the machines began to show signs that they were beating the bohm limit 44 at the 1965 second international atomic energy agency conference on fusion at the uk s newly opened culham centre for fusion energy artsimovich reported that their systems were surpassing the bohm limit by 10 times spitzer reviewing the presentations suggested that the bohm limit may still apply the results were within the range of experimental error of results seen on the stellarators and the temperature measurements based on the magnetic fields were simply not trustworthy 44 the next major international fusion meeting was held in august 1968 in novosibirsk by this time two additional tokamak designs had been completed tm 2 in 1965 and t 4 in 1968 results from t 3 had continued to improve and similar results were coming from early tests of the new reactors at the meeting the soviet delegation announced that t 3 was producing electron temperatures of 1000 ev equivalent to 10 million degrees celsius and that confinement time was at least 50 times the bohm limit 45 these results were at least 10 times that of any other machine if correct they represented an enormous leap for the fusion community spitzer remained sceptical noting that the temperature measurements were still based on the indirect calculations from the magnetic properties of the plasma many concluded they were due to an effect known as runaway electrons and that the soviets were measuring only those extremely energetic electrons and not the bulk temperature the soviets countered with several arguments suggesting the temperature they were measuring was maxwellian and the debate raged 46 culham five edit in the aftermath of zeta the uk teams began the development of new plasma diagnostic tools to provide more accurate measurements among these was the use of a laser to directly measure the temperature of the bulk electrons using thomson scattering this technique was well known and respected in the fusion community 47 artsimovich had publicly called it brilliant artsimovich invited bas pease the head of culham to use their devices on the soviet reactors at the height of the cold war in what is still considered a major political manoeuvre on artsimovich s part british physicists were allowed to visit the kurchatov institute the heart of the soviet nuclear bomb effort 48 the british team nicknamed the culham five 49 arrived late in 1968 after a lengthy installation and calibration process the team measured the temperatures over a period of many experimental runs initial results were available by august 1969 the soviets were correct their results were accurate the team phoned the results home to culham who then passed them along in a confidential phone call to washington 50 the final results were published in nature in november 1969 51 the results of this announcement have been described as a veritable stampede of tokamak construction around the world 52 one serious problem remained because the electrical current in the plasma was much lower and produced much less compression than a pinch machine this meant the temperature of the plasma was limited to the resistive heating rate of the current first proposed in 1950 spitzer resistivity stated that the electrical resistance of a plasma was reduced as the temperature increased 53 meaning the heating rate of the plasma would slow as the devices improved and temperatures were pressed higher calculations demonstrated that the resulting maximum temperatures while staying within q 1 would be limited to the low millions of degrees artsimovich had been quick to point this out in novosibirsk stating that future progress would require new heating methods to be developed 54 us turmoil edit one of the people attending the novosibirsk meeting in 1968 was amasa stone bishop one of the leaders of the us fusion program one of the few other devices to show clear evidence of beating the bohm limit at that time was the multipole concept both lawrence livermore and the princeton plasma physics laboratory pppl home of spitzer s stellarator were building variations on the multipole design while moderately successful on their own t 3 greatly outperformed either machine bishop was concerned that the multipoles were redundant and thought the us should consider a tokamak of its own 55 when he raised the issue at a december 1968 meeting directors of the labs refused to consider it melvin b gottlieb of princeton was exasperated asking do you think that this committee can out think the scientists 56 with the major labs demanding they control their own research one lab found itself left out oak ridge had originally entered the fusion field with studies for reactor fueling systems but branched out into a mirror program of their own by the mid 1960s their dcx designs were running out of ideas offering nothing that the similar program at the more prestigious and politically powerful livermore didn t this made them highly receptive to new concepts 57 after a considerable internal debate herman postma formed a small group in early 1969 to consider the tokamak 57 they came up with a new design later christened ormak that had several novel features primary among them was the way the external field was created in a single large copper block fed power from a large transformer below the torus this was as opposed to traditional designs that used magnet windings on the outside they felt the single block would produce a much more uniform field it would also have the advantage of allowing the torus to have a smaller major radius lacking the need to route cables through the donut hole leading to a lower aspect ratio which the soviets had already suggested would produce better results 58 tokamak race in the us edit in early 1969 artsimovich visited mit where he was hounded by those interested in fusion he finally agreed to give several lectures in april 54 and then allowed lengthy question and answer sessions as these went on mit itself grew interested in the tokamak having previously stayed out of the fusion field for a variety of reasons bruno coppi was at mit at the time and following the same concepts as postma s team came up with his own low aspect ratio concept alcator instead of ormak s toroidal transformer alcator used traditional ring shaped magnets but required them to be much smaller than existing designs mit s francis bitter magnet laboratory was the world leader in magnet design and they were confident they could build them 54 during 1969 two additional groups entered the field at general atomics tihiro ohkawa had been developing multipole reactors and submitted a concept based on these ideas this was a tokamak that would have a non circular plasma cross section the same math that suggested a lower aspect ratio would improve performance also suggested that a c or d shaped plasma would do the same he called the new design doublet 59 meanwhile a group at university of texas at austin was proposing a relatively simple tokamak to explore heating the plasma through deliberately induced turbulence the texas turbulent tokamak 60 when the members of the atomic energy commissions fusion steering committee met again in june 1969 they had tokamak proposals coming out of our ears 60 the only major lab working on a toroidal design that was not proposing a tokamak was princeton who refused to consider it in spite of their model c stellarator being just about perfect for such a conversion they continued to offer a long list of reasons why the model c should not be converted when these were questioned a furious debate broke out about whether the soviet results were reliable 60 watching the debate take place gottlieb had a change of heart there was no point moving forward with the tokamak if the soviet electron temperature measurements were not accurate so he formulated a plan to either prove or disprove their results while swimming in the pool during the lunch break he told harold furth his plan to which furth replied well maybe you re right 50 after lunch the various teams presented their designs at which point gottlieb presented his idea for a stellarator tokamak based on the model c 50 the standing committee noted that this system could be complete in six months while ormak would take a year 50 it was only a short time later that the confidential results from the culham five were released when they met again in october the standing committee released funding for all of these proposals the model c s new configuration soon named symmetrical tokamak intended to simply verify the soviet results while the others would explore ways to go well beyond t 3 61 heating us takes the lead edit overhead view of the princeton large torus in 1975 plt set numerous records and demonstrated that the temperatures needed for fusion were possible experiments on the symmetric tokamak began in may 1970 and by early the next year they had confirmed the soviet results and then surpassed them the stellarator was abandoned and pppl turned its considerable expertise to the problem of heating the plasma two concepts seemed to hold promise pppl proposed using magnetic compression a pinch like technique to compress a warm plasma to raise its temperature but providing that compression through magnets rather than current 62 oak ridge suggested neutral beam injection small particle accelerators that would shoot fuel atoms through the surrounding magnetic field where they would collide with the plasma and heat it 63 pppl s adiabatic toroidal compressor atc began operation in may 1972 followed shortly thereafter by a neutral beam equipped ormak both demonstrated significant problems but pppl leapt past oak ridge by fitting beam injectors to atc and provided clear evidence of successful heating in 1973 this success scooped oak ridge who fell from favour within the washington steering committee 64 by this time a much larger design based on beam heating was under construction the princeton large torus or plt plt was designed specifically to give a clear indication whether the tokamak concept plus auxiliary heating can form a basis for a future fusion reactor 65 plt was an enormous success continually raising its internal temperature until it hit 60 million celsius 8 000 ev eight times t 3 s record in 1978 this is a key point in the development of the tokamak fusion reactions become self sustaining at temperatures between 50 and 100 million celsius plt demonstrated that this was technically achievable 65 these experiments especially plt put the us far in the lead in tokamak research this is due largely to budget a tokamak cost about 500 000 and the us annual fusion budget was around 25 million at that time 45 they could afford to explore all of the promising methods of heating ultimately discovering neutral beams to be among the most effective 66 during this period robert hirsch took over the directorate of fusion development in the u s atomic energy commission hirsch felt that the program could not be sustained at its current funding levels without demonstrating tangible results he began to reformulate the entire program what had once been a lab led effort of mostly scientific exploration was now a washington led effort to build a working power producing reactor 66 this was given a boost by the 1973 oil crisis which led to greatly increased research into alternative energy systems 67 1980s great hope great disappointment edit the joint european torus jet the largest currently operating tokamak which has been in operation since 1983 by the late 1970s tokamaks had reached all the conditions needed for a practical fusion reactor in 1978 plt had demonstrated ignition temperatures the next year the soviet t 7 successfully used superconducting magnets for the first time 68 doublet proved to be a success and led to almost all future designs adopting this shaped plasma approach it appeared all that was needed to build a power producing reactor was to put all of these design concepts into a single machine one that would be capable of running with the radioactive tritium in its fuel mix 69 the race was on during the 1970s four major second generation proposals were funded worldwide the soviets continued their development lineage with the t 15 68 while a pan european effort was developing the joint european torus jet and japan began the jt 60 effort originally known as the breakeven plasma test facility in the us hirsch began formulating plans for a similar design skipping over proposals for another stepping stone design directly to a tritium burning one this emerged as the tokamak fusion test reactor tftr run directly from washington and not linked to any specific lab 69 originally favouring oak ridge as the host hirsch moved it to pppl after others convinced him they would work the hardest on it because they had the most to lose 70 the excitement was so widespread that several commercial ventures to produce commercial tokamaks began around this time best known among these in 1978 bob guccione publisher of penthouse magazine met robert bussard and became the world s biggest and most committed private investor in fusion technology ultimately putting 20 million of his own money into bussard s compact tokamak funding by the riggs bank led to this effort being known as the riggatron 71 tftr won the construction race and began operation in 1982 followed shortly by jet in 1983 and jt 60 in 1985 jet quickly took the lead in critical experiments moving from test gases to deuterium and increasingly powerful shots but it soon became clear that none of the new systems were working as expected a host of new instabilities appeared along with a number of more practical problems that continued to interfere with their performance on top of this dangerous excursions of the plasma hitting with the walls of the reactor were evident in both tftr and jet even when working perfectly plasma confinement at fusion temperatures the so called fusion triple product continued to be far below what would be needed for a practical reactor design through the mid 1980s the reasons for many of these problems became clear and various solutions were offered however these would significantly increase the size and complexity of the machines a follow on design incorporating these changes would be both enormous and vastly more expensive than either jet or tftr a new period of pessimism descended on the fusion field iter edit main article iter cutaway diagram of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter the largest tokamak in the world which began construction in 2013 and is projected to begin full operation in 2035 it is intended as a demonstration that a practical fusion reactor is possible and will produce 500 megawatts of power blue human figure at bottom shows scale at the same time these experiments were demonstrating problems much of the impetus for the us s massive funding disappeared in 1986 ronald reagan declared the 1970s energy crisis was over 72 and funding for advanced energy sources had been slashed in the early 1980s some thought of an international reactor design had been ongoing since june 1973 under the name intor for international tokamak reactor this was originally started through an agreement between richard nixon and leonid brezhnev but had been moving slowly since its first real meeting on 23 november 1978 73 during the geneva summit in november 1985 reagan raised the issue with mikhail gorbachev and proposed reforming the organization the two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and in this connection advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy which is essentially inexhaustible for the benefit for all mankind 74 the next year an agreement was signed between the us soviet union european union and japan creating the international thermonuclear experimental reactor organization 75 76 design work began in 1988 and since that time the iter reactor has been the primary tokamak design effort worldwide design edit magnetic fields in a tokamak tokamak magnetic field and current shown is the toroidal field and the coils blue that produce it the plasma current red and the poloidal field created by it and the resulting twisted field when these are overlaid basic problem edit positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons in a fusion plasma are at very high temperatures and have correspondingly large velocities in order to maintain the fusion process particles from the hot plasma must be confined in the central region or the plasma will rapidly cool magnetic confinement fusion devices exploit the fact that charged particles in a magnetic field experience a lorentz force and follow helical paths along the field lines 77 the simplest magnetic confinement system is a solenoid a plasma in a solenoid will spiral about the lines of field running down its center preventing motion towards the sides however this does not prevent motion towards the ends the obvious solution is to bend the solenoid around into a circle forming a torus however it was demonstrated that such an arrangement is not uniform for purely geometric reasons the field on the outside edge of the torus is lower than on the inside edge this asymmetry causes the electrons and ions to drift across the field and eventually hit the walls of the torus 19 the solution is to shape the lines so they do not simply run around the torus but twist around like the stripes on a barber pole or candycane in such a field any single particle will find itself at the outside edge where it will drift one way say up and then as it follows its magnetic line around the torus it will find itself on the inside edge where it will drift the other way this cancellation is not perfect but calculations showed it was enough to allow the fuel to remain in the reactor for a useful time 77 tokamak solution edit the two first solutions to making a design with the required twist were the stellarator which did so through a mechanical arrangement twisting the entire torus and the z pinch design which ran an electrical current through the plasma to create a second magnetic field to the same end both demonstrated improved confinement times compared to a simple torus but both also demonstrated a variety of effects that caused the plasma to be lost from the reactors at rates that were not sustainable the tokamak is essentially identical to the z pinch concept in its physical layout 78 its key innovation was the realization that the instabilities that were causing the pinch to lose its plasma could be controlled the issue was how twisty the fields were fields that caused the particles to transit inside and out more than once per orbit around the long axis torus were much more stable than devices that had less twist this ratio of twists to orbits became known as the safety factor denoted q previous devices operated at q about 1 3 while the tokamak operates at q 1 this increases stability by orders of magnitude when the problem is considered even more closely the need for a vertical parallel to the axis of rotation component of the magnetic field arises the lorentz force of the toroidal plasma current in the vertical field provides the inward force that holds the plasma torus in equilibrium other issues edit while the tokamak addresses the issue of plasma stability in a gross sense plasmas are also subject to a number of dynamic instabilities one of these the kink instability is strongly suppressed by the tokamak layout a side effect of the high safety factors of tokamaks the lack of kinks allowed the tokamak to operate at much higher temperatures than previous machines and this allowed a host of new phenomena to appear one of these the banana orbits is caused by the wide range of particle energies in a tokamak much of the fuel is hot but a certain percentage is much cooler due to the high twist of the fields in the tokamak particles following their lines of force rapidly move towards the inner edge and then outer as they move inward they are subject to increasing magnetic fields due to the smaller radius concentrating the field the low energy particles in the fuel will reflect off this increasing field and begin to travel backwards through the fuel colliding with the higher energy nuclei and scattering them out of the plasma this process causes fuel to be lost from the reactor although this process is slow enough that a practical reactor is still well within reach 79 breakeven q and ignition edit one of the first goals for any controlled fusion device is to reach breakeven the point where the energy being released by the fusion reactions is equal to the amount of energy being used to maintain the reaction the ratio of output to input energy is denoted q and breakeven corresponds to a q of 1 a q of more than one is needed for the reactor to generate net energy but for practical reasons it is desirable for it to be much higher once breakeven is reached further improvements in confinement generally lead to a rapidly increasing q that is because some of the energy being given off by the fusion reactions of the most common fusion fuel a 50 50 mix of deuterium and tritium is in the form of alpha particles these can collide with the fuel nuclei in the plasma and heat it reducing the amount of external heat needed at some point known as ignition this internal self heating is enough to keep the reaction going without any external heating corresponding to an infinite q in the case of the tokamak this self heating process is maximized if the alpha particles remain in the fuel long enough to guarantee they will collide with the fuel as the alphas are electrically charged they are subject to the same fields that are confining the fuel plasma the amount of time they spend in the fuel can be maximized by ensuring their orbit in the field remains within the plasma it can be demonstrated that this occurs when the electrical current in the plasma is about 3 ma 80 advanced tokamaks edit in the early 1970s studies at princeton into the use of high power superconducting magnets in future tokamak designs examined the layout of the magnets they noticed that the arrangement of the main toroidal coils meant that there was significantly more tension between the magnets on the inside of the curvature where they were closer together considering this they noted that the tensional forces within the magnets would be evened out if they were shaped like a d rather than an o this became known as the princeton d coil 81 this was not the first time this sort of arrangement had been considered although for entirely different reasons the safety factor varies across the axis of the machine for purely geometrical reasons it is always smaller at the inside edge of the plasma closest to the machine s center because the long axis is shorter there that means that a machine with an average q 2 might still be less than 1 in certain areas in the 1970s it was suggested that one way to counteract this and produce a design with a higher average q would be to shape the magnetic fields so that the plasma only filled the outer half of the torus shaped like a d or c when viewed end on instead of the normal circular cross section one of the first machines to incorporate a d shaped plasma was the jet which began its design work in 1973 this decision was made both for theoretical reasons as well as practical because the force is larger on the inside edge of the torus there is a large net force pressing inward on the entire reactor the d shape also had the advantage of reducing the net force as well as making the supported inside edge flatter so it was easier to support 82 code exploring the general layout noticed that a non circular shape would slowly drift vertically which led to the addition of an active feedback system to hold it in the center 83 once jet had selected this layout the general atomics doublet iii team redesigned that machine into the d iiid with a d shaped cross section and it was selected for the japanese jt 60 design as well this layout has been largely universal since then one problem seen in all fusion reactors is that the presence of heavier elements causes energy to be lost at an increased rate cooling the plasma during the very earliest development of fusion power a solution to this problem was found the divertor essentially a large mass spectrometer that would cause the heavier elements to be flung out of the reactor this was initially part of the stellarator designs where it is easy to integrate into the magnetic windings however designing a divertor for a tokamak proved to be a very difficult design problem another problem seen in all fusion designs is the heat load that the plasma places on the wall of the confinement vessel there are materials that can handle this load but they are generally undesirable and expensive heavy metals when such materials are sputtered in collisions with hot ions their atoms mix with the fuel and rapidly cool it a solution used on most tokamak designs is the limiter a small ring of light metal that projected into the chamber so that the plasma would hit it before hitting the walls this eroded the limiter and caused its atoms to mix with the fuel but these lighter materials cause less disruption than the wall materials when reactors moved to the d shaped plasmas it was quickly noted that the escaping particle flux of the plasma could be shaped as well over time this led to the idea of using the fields to create an internal divertor that flings the heavier elements out of the fuel typically towards the bottom of the reactor there a pool of liquid lithium metal is used as a sort of limiter the particles hit it and are rapidly cooled remaining in the lithium this internal pool is much easier to cool due to its location and although some lithium atoms are released into the plasma its very low mass makes it a much smaller problem than even the lightest metals used previously as machines began to explore this newly shaped plasma they noticed that certain arrangements of the fields and plasma parameters would sometimes enter what is now known as the high confinement mode or h mode which operated stably at higher temperatures and pressures operating in the h mode which can also be seen in stellarators is now a major design goal of the tokamak design finally it was noted that when the plasma had a non uniform density it would give rise to internal electrical currents this is known as the bootstrap current this allows a properly designed reactor to generate some of the internal current needed to twist the magnetic field lines without having to supply it from an external source this has a number of advantages and modern designs all attempt to generate as much of their total current through the bootstrap process as possible by the early 1990s the combination of these features and others collectively gave rise to the advanced tokamak concept this forms the basis of modern research including iter plasma disruptions edit tokamaks are subject to events known as disruptions that cause confinement to be lost in milliseconds there are two primary mechanisms in one the vertical displacement event vde the entire plasma moves vertically until it touches the upper or lower section of the vacuum chamber in the other the major disruption long wavelength non axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical instabilities cause the plasma to be forced into non symmetrical shapes often squeezed into the top and bottom of the chamber 84 when the plasma touches the vessel walls it undergoes rapid cooling or thermal quenching in the major disruption case this is normally accompanied by a brief increase in plasma current as the plasma concentrates quenching ultimately causes the plasma confinement to break up in the case of the major disruption the current drops again the current quench the initial increase in current is not seen in the vde and the thermal and current quench occurs at the same time 84 in both cases the thermal and electrical load of the plasma is rapidly deposited on the reactor vessel which has to be able to handle these loads iter is designed to handle 2600 of these events over its lifetime 85 for modern high energy devices where plasma currents are on the order of 15 megaamperes in iter it is possible the brief increase in current during a major disruption will cross a critical threshold this occurs when the current produces a force on the electrons that is higher than the frictional forces of the collisions between particles in the plasma in this event electrons can be rapidly accelerated to relativistic velocities creating so called runaway electrons in the relativistic runaway electron avalanche these retain their energy even as the current quench is occurring on the bulk of the plasma 85 when confinement finally breaks down these runaway electrons follow the path of least resistance and impact the side of the reactor these can reach 12 megaamps of current deposited in a small area well beyond the capabilities of any mechanical solution 84 in one famous case the tokamak de fontenay aux roses had a major disruption where the runaway electrons burned a hole through the vacuum chamber 85 the occurrence of major disruptions in running tokamaks has always been rather high of the order of a few percent of the total numbers of the shots in currently operated tokamaks the damage is often large but rarely dramatic in the iter tokamak it is expected that the occurrence of a limited number of major disruptions will definitively damage the chamber with no possibility to restore the device 86 87 88 the development of systems to counter the effects of runaway electrons is considered a must have piece of technology for the operational level iter 85 a large amplitude of the central current density can also result in internal disruptions or sawteeth which do not generally result in termination of the discharge 89 plasma heating edit in an operating fusion reactor part of the energy generated will serve to maintain the plasma temperature as fresh deuterium and tritium are introduced however in the startup of a reactor either initially or after a temporary shutdown the plasma will have to be heated to its operating temperature of greater than 10 kev over 100 million degrees celsius in current tokamak and other magnetic fusion experiments insufficient fusion energy is produced to maintain the plasma temperature and constant external heating must be supplied chinese researchers set up the experimental advanced superconducting tokamak east in 2006 which is believed to sustain 100 million degree celsius plasma sun has 15 million degree celsius temperature which is required to initiate the fusion between hydrogen atoms according to the latest test conducted in east test conducted in november 2018 ohmic heating inductive mode edit since the plasma is an electrical conductor it is possible to heat the plasma by inducing a current through it the induced current that provides most of the poloidal field is also a major source of initial heating the heating caused by the induced current is called ohmic or resistive heating it is the same kind of heating that occurs in an electric light bulb or in an electric heater the heat generated depends on the resistance of the plasma and the amount of electric current running through it but as the temperature of heated plasma rises the resistance decreases and ohmic heating becomes less effective it appears that the maximum plasma temperature attainable by ohmic heating in a tokamak is 20 30 million degrees celsius to obtain still higher temperatures additional heating methods must be used the current is induced by continually increasing the current through an electromagnetic winding linked with the plasma torus the plasma can be viewed as the secondary winding of a transformer this is inherently a pulsed process because there is a limit to the current through the primary there are also other limitations on long pulses tokamaks must therefore either operate for short periods or rely on other means of heating and current drive magnetic compression edit a gas can be heated by sudden compression in the same way the temperature of a plasma is increased if it is compressed rapidly by increasing the confining magnetic field in a tokamak this compression is achieved simply by moving the plasma into a region of higher magnetic field i e radially inward since plasma compression brings the ions closer together the process has the additional benefit of facilitating attainment of the required density for a fusion reactor magnetic compression was an area of research in the early tokamak stampede and was the purpose of one major design the atc the concept has not been widely used since then although a somewhat similar concept is part of the general fusion design neutral beam injection edit see also neutral beam injection neutral beam injection involves the introduction of high energy rapidly moving atoms or molecules into an ohmically heated magnetically confined plasma within the tokamak the high energy atoms originate as ions in an arc chamber before being extracted through a high voltage grid set the term ion source is used to generally mean the assembly consisting of a set of electron emitting filaments an arc chamber volume and a set of extraction grids a second device similar in concept is used to separately accelerate electrons to the same energy the much lighter mass of the electrons makes this device much smaller than its ion counterpart the two beams then intersect where the ions and electrons recombine into neutral atoms allowing them to travel through the magnetic fields once the neutral beam enters the tokamak interactions with the main plasma ions occur this has two effects one is that the injected atoms re ionize and become charged thereby becoming trapped inside the reactor and adding to the fuel mass the other is that the process of being ionized occurs through impacts with the rest of the fuel and these impacts deposit energy in that fuel heating it this form of heating has no inherent energy temperature limitation in contrast to the ohmic method but its rate is limited to the current in the injectors ion source extraction voltages are typically on the order of 50 100 kv and high voltage negative ion sources 1 mv are being developed for iter the iter neutral beam test facility in padova will be the first iter facility to start operation 90 while neutral beam injection is used primarily for plasma heating it can also be used as a diagnostic tool and in feedback control by making a pulsed beam consisting of a string of brief 2 10 ms beam blips deuterium is a primary fuel for neutral beam heating systems and hydrogen and helium are sometimes used for selected experiments radio frequency heating edit set of hyperfrequency tubes 84 ghz and 118 ghz for plasma heating by electron cyclotron waves on the tokamak à configuration variable tcv courtesy of spc epfl see also radio frequency heating and dielectric heating high frequency electromagnetic waves are generated by oscillators often by gyrotrons or klystrons outside the torus if the waves have the correct frequency or wavelength and polarization their energy can be transferred to the charged particles in the plasma which in turn collide with other plasma particles thus increasing the temperature of the bulk plasma various techniques exist including electron cyclotron resonance heating ecrh and ion cyclotron resonance heating this energy is usually transferred by microwaves particle inventory edit plasma discharges within the tokamak s vacuum chamber consist of energized ions and atoms and the energy from these particles eventually reaches the inner wall of the chamber through radiation collisions or lack of confinement the inner wall of the chamber is water cooled and the heat from the particles is removed via conduction through the wall to the water and convection of the heated water to an external cooling system turbomolecular or diffusion pumps allow for particles to be evacuated from the bulk volume and cryogenic pumps consisting of a liquid helium cooled surface serve to effectively control the density throughout the discharge by providing an energy sink for condensation to occur when done correctly the fusion reactions produce large amounts of high energy neutrons being electrically neutral and relatively tiny the neutrons are not affected by the magnetic fields nor are they stopped much by the surrounding vacuum chamber the neutron flux is reduced significantly at a purpose built neutron shield boundary that surrounds the tokamak in all directions shield materials vary but are generally materials made of atoms which are close to the size of neutrons because these work best to absorb the neutron and its energy good candidate materials include those with much hydrogen such as water and plastics boron atoms are also good absorbers of neutrons thus concrete and polyethylene doped with boron make inexpensive neutron shielding materials once freed the neutron has a relatively short half life of about 10 minutes before it decays into a proton and electron with the emission of energy when the time comes to actually try to make electricity from a tokamak based reactor some of the neutrons produced in the fusion process would be absorbed by a liquid metal blanket and their kinetic energy would be used in heat transfer processes to ultimately turn a generator experimental tokamaks edit see also list of fusion experiments

was initially created for charlton comics but was later acquired by dc comics and revised for dc s post crisis continuity 3 in 2011 dc comics relaunched its superhero comics and rewrote the histories of some characters from scratch including captain atom giving him a new origin appearance and slightly altered powers captain atom was the character inspiration for doctor manhattan who was featured in the miniseries and later live action film adaptation watchmen which would be connected to the dc universe in the miniseries doomsday clock throughout the years the character has been featured in several moderate to short lived eponymous series and has been a member of several different versions of dc s flagship superhero team the justice league in all incarnations the character initially served for the military in the charlton comics continuity he was a scientist named allen adam and gained his abilities by accident when he was seemingly atomized and then his body reformed now existing as an atomic powered being in both dc comics incarnations he is an air force pilot named nathaniel adam who was a test subject in a scientific experiment who seemingly disintegrated in the process only to reappear later as the super powered captain atom 4 over the years dc has attempted to reinvent the character several times for a period the character assumed the mantle of the supervillain monarch and in 2005 dc attempted to retell the captain atom story with an entirely new character breach who was subsequently discarded in the new continuity following dc s 2011 relaunch captain atom has never been a member of the justice league and the team views him with distrust his character origin and abilities were also revised captain atom has appeared in several animated television and film adaptations of justice league and other dc storylines since the mid 2000s where he is depicted as a powerful member of the justice league whose abilities place him roughly on par with the franchise s flagship character superman in several animated depictions he has served the role as a government stooge when the government has brought itself into conflict with the justice league fictional character biography edit charlton comics silver age edit strange suspense stories 75 june 1965 a reprint issue of captain atom s debut cover art by steve ditko the charlton comics version of captain atom was allen adam the character s origin had adam working as a technician in a special experimental rocket when it accidentally launched with him trapped inside 5 adam was atomized when the rocket exploded while entering the upper atmosphere however he somehow gained superpowers that included the ability to reform his body safely on the ground he was outfitted in a red and yellow costume that was designed to shield people from the radiation of his nuclear powers when he powered up his hair changed to a silvery white later in his own title he replaced his original red and gold costume with a liquid metal outfit that was under his skin and which transformed when he powered up captain atom s powers were similar to such other nuclear powered superheroes as gold key s doctor solar and dell comics nukla captain atom was first published in a series of short stories in the anthology series space adventures 33 40 march 1960 june 1961 and 42 october 1961 charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology strange suspense stories beginning with issue 75 june 1965 renaming the title captain atom with issue 78 december 1965 and giving the hero full length stories and supervillain antagonists such as dr spectro previous stories involved cold war anti communist missions or dealing with aliens captain atom later teamed with the superhero nightshade with whom he shared a mutual attraction the superhero the blue beetle starred in the initial back up feature later replaced by a nightshade back up series captain atom was cancelled with issue 89 december 1967 in 1975 the unfinished ditko art for issue 90 was inked by john byrne and published in the first two issues of the official charlton fanzine charlton bullseye as the 10 page showdown in

issue americomics special 1 august 1983 in a story teaming the charlton action heroes the blue beetle captain atom nightshade and the question as the sentinels of justice this last story had

message a new post crisis version of the character was introduced in march 1987 with the launch of a monthly comic written by cary bates long time writer of the flash and superman co written by greg weisman and drawn by pat broderick 6 this modern captain s name is established as nathaniel christopher adam a united states air force officer and vietnam war veteran adam had been framed for a crime and was under military justice condemned to death this taking place under the purview of col wade eiling in the year 1968 as an alternative to execution adam was asked to participate in project captain atom a military experiment with a slim chance of survival he agreed to this in exchange for an unconditional presidential pardon the experiment involved testing the hull of a crashed alien ship s durability by placing a human being adam within the metal craft and then exploding an atomic weapon under it the weapon went off and adam was seemingly disintegrated eighteen years later adam suddenly reappeared the alien metal now bonded around his body afforded him incredible abilities far beyond that of a mere mortal bonded with the metal nathaniel adam now had powers that resulted from the metal s ability to tap into the quantum field 4 7 it was revealed that the alien metal could absorb energy but only past a certain threshold any excess absorption would force it to jump forward in time based on the amount of energy obtained flung into the year 1986 adam becomes literally a man out of time wade eiling is now a military general and the second husband of adam s now deceased wife angela everyone had assumed that nathaniel adam died the day of the experiment so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refused to acknowledge the previous pardon seizing the opportunity at hand eiling uses the outstanding murder treason charges against adam to blackmail him into acting as a military controlled government sanctioned superhero codenamed captain atom the events of the charlton stories are used cleverly by bates as a readymade fabricated past to convince the world that adam had secretly been a superhero for years enabling him to quickly gain the trust and reputation as an unsung patriot and hero for his non superhero activities nathaniel uses the alias cameron scott an air force intelligence operative during this time he meets the superpowered terrorist plastique a recurring part of nathaniel s life early conflicts involve him coming to terms with the lost time he missed with his now grown children the death of his wife her marriage to eiling and the overall ramifications of his newly acquired powers later he learns that project atom a secret government funded group that used new experimental machines to harness powerful energies had repeated the same process and created the supervillain major force a bloodthirsty madman lacking captain atom s morality and classic military a f discipline atom adam serves under eiling reluctantly while befriending research scientist doctor heinrich megala of project atom who had previously helped to create an elaborate cover story for atom adam doctor megala is responsible for creating the x ionizer technology capable of cutting the skin of most invulnerable metahumans 8 in spite of his disabilities and poor health he helped atom adam learn about the quantum field as well as about his powers captain atom later succeeds in clearing his name of the original treason charge and eventually rebels against eiling resigning from the air force and becoming an actual superhero by captain atom 39 megala s health would deteriorate to a point where he asked captain atom for help and attempted to use his atomic energy to neutralize the life threatening disease he is suffering from but becomes blinded as a side effect fearing that eiling would eventually turn on him megala claims that he intends to set up a contingency plan which would make public all of project atom s classified secrets once his heart ceased to function megala s plan proved to be a mere bluff when he is killed in a confrontation with the ghost a k a alec rois but captain atom decides to become the actual whistleblower and discloses the truth on national television captain atom joins the justice league at the request of the u s government eventually serving as leader of justice league europe during his career he has a brief romance with catherine cobert develops a friendly rivalry with firestorm whose nickname is the nuclear man becomes involved with and eventually marries plastique ironically a one time firestorm foe learns basic heroics from batman when he briefly loses access to the quantum field and commands the metahuman forces during the invasion storyline where earth was under attack by an alliance of alien forces captain atom was canceled as of issue 57 in 1991 because atom was slated to become the hero turned villain monarch in dc s armageddon 2001 crossover event however when word of this leaked out dc changed the ending at the last minute atom and the monarch character continue battling through time in armageddon the alien agenda limited series until he is returned to his own time at the conclusion captain atom then returns to the league involved in the zero hour crisis in 1994 9 founding an offshoot team extreme justice in 1995 10 while leading extreme justice captain atom comes across another version of monarch this one claiming to be the real nathaniel adam later in 1999 he is a member of the poorly received team known as the living assault weapons or l a w the members of whom are all previously charlton comics characters in 2003 he again teams up with several former members of the justice league as the super buddies in the humorous limited series formerly known as the justice league around this time various stories reintroduce atom s conflict between his role in the superhero community and his responsibilities as a government agent at some point atom s marriage to plastique ends in divorce apart from a brief mention of her at the beginning of l a w the marriage appears to be forgotten plastique has reappeared in 2006 as a villainess again undoing her reformation into a heroine a later confirmation is brought in by the captain atom armageddon miniseries in which after falling in love with angela spica of the authority captain atom reminisces about his short marriage with plastique and attributes their divorce to their irreconcilable views about world and politics since nathaniel even in his spousal life could not stop being a loyal soldier of the u s and plastique could not simply put aside her life as a terrorist later in 2003 writer jeph loeb returns captain atom to his roots as he went back to work for the government this time for president lex luthor in the first story arc of the superman batman series atom seemingly sacrifices his life to save superman and earth by piloting a starship to destroy a kryptonite meteor but as it had previously been established that this type of accident could not kill him he soon returns to life and to the background of the dc universe in a 2005 issue of superman batman it is made clear that captain atom survived the collision with the kryptonite meteor but has absorbed massive amounts of radiation and become a super villain described as a kryptonite man the radiation is siphoned out of captain atom using a device made by hiro okamura the new toyman which returns captain atom to his usual self if somewhat confused armageddon and worldstorm edit in 2005

with majestic soundly defeated seeing the frightened reactions of onlookers and puzzling over his own altered appearance he realizes that he has somehow become trapped on an alternate earth one where superheroes are feared by the general populace mistaken by the local superheroes as the force destined to destroy their universe he is in fact an instrument used ultimately by nikola hanssen new host

aside from its monitor 17 it was later learned that the monitor solomon had attacked captain atom in blüdhaven rupturing his skin and setting into motion his transformation into monarch 18 project 7734 edit during jimmy olsen s investigation about project 7734 the secret black op commanded by sam lane to fight extraterrestrial menaces on earth including kryptonians it is discovered that an amnesiac and brainwashed captain atom is now one of the prized possessions of sam lane project breach refers to his capture and brainwashing into a weapon with lane wanting to stress the similarities between adam and tim zanetti or planet breaker captain atom refers to his name and rank as codename captain atom 19 captain atom returns in a co feature in action comics 879 and appears in his normal costume instead of the monarch armor he was last seen wearing he is shown to reside in a mystical medieval reminiscent realm attacking a highly fortified castle for unknown reasons other than as he states his mission after obliterating the castle s defenses he has a brief flashback to a moment with the justice league then falls to the ground disoriented no explanation is given for his return to his original appearance his whereabouts since countdown to final crisis or why he has reverted to his heroic persona rather than that of the conquest seeking monarch in action comics 880 it is revealed that captain atom has little or no memory of who he is other than his name it is revealed that this mysterious realm is connected to project 7734 and is part of his conditioning later he is attacked by major force an enemy believed to have been destroyed by captain atom himself when he first became monarch 20 mon el appears and helps captain atom escape taking him to the justice league s satellite where the league members declare that they are going to bring him to justice for his actions as monarch 21 after a struggle with the league captain atom tells them what he can remember the league reminds him he was a hero who once saved the planet he feels he has changed from the man he once was and that he needs to go back to the magic world to make right what he has done the shadowpact are called on to join him on his quest and provide a way for him to reach sorcerers world 22 generation lost edit captain atom appears as one of the central characters in justice league generation lost a maxi series that takes place during the wider brightest day event at the start of the series captain atom is recruited as part of a massive group of superheroes tasked with hunting down the jli s founder and ted kord s murderer maxwell lord during an encounter with max at the justice league s former new york headquarters captain atom is rendered unconscious alongside fire ice and booster gold the former justice league members awake to discover that lord has used his mental abilities to erase his existence from the minds of every single human on the planet save for those present at the embassy and the others 23 afterwards captain atom discovers that max has mentally influenced the us army into believing that he had betrayed them 24 captain atom shares with the group that when he absorbed a nuclear bomb max had set off he found himself thrown through time to the future of 24th century an earth that had fallen into chaos through metahuman wars and backward in technology atom found a woman elderly and grotesque who turned out to be an aged power girl telling him it was maxwell lord who was responsible for all of this atom is then pulled back into the present and tells the rest of the team that the world needs them to stop the instigated max 25 after discovering that the omacs had dismembered a droid captain atom was struck by magog who simply scoffs at the notion and states that he has come to kill captain atom at the behest of max 26 in their battle captain atom manages to convince magog he is being manipulated by max magog stops the attacks as he remembers max s existence and captain atom is prepared to help him however max is on hand and forces magog to kill himself with his spear max uses his powers to manipulate everyone into believing that captain atom has killed magog before leaving captain atom realizes magog s spear is about to explode with energy captain atom tries to absorb as much as he can thrusting him into the time stream again as a crater is left behind 27 captain atom is propelled through time again to 112 years in the future where a metahuman war against the omacs had devastated the planet captain atom battled for survival alongside the future versions of the justice league but they all are eventually contaminated by a new nanovirus version of the omacs and one by one become omacs themselves as a dying power girl tells him that the catalyst for all this was the death of wonder woman by max s hands captain atom is returned into the present but not before batman orders him to terminate the omac project to stop max s plan 28 during the final battle against the new omac known as omac prime captain atom allows omac prime to absorb his energy before reabsorbing the energy and overloading his powers resulting in him being thrown into the time stream once again just before this occurred captain atom grabbed max and threatened to pull him into the time stream as well unless max undid the global mindwipe of his existence max complied and everyone on the planet had their memories of him restored before captain atom was pulled away to a time and space unknown max later released a statement onto the internet exonerating captain atom of the deaths in chicago saying far worse would have happened if he had not intervened 29 the new 52 edit in the new 52 reboot of dc s continuity captain atom is reintroduced with altered powers appearance and origin he is still usaf pilot nathaniel adam in the new reality adam volunteers to participate in an experiment conducted by a research facility called the continuum at this facility dr megala s research is focused on the quantum field and on dimensional transfer through m theory adam is asked to pilot the dimensional transfer vessel by dr megala who is now presented as a particle physicist working out of colorado 30 but is seemingly atomized during the experiment soon afterwards he reappears now an energy based life form according to dr megala captain atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve tapping into the strong nuclear force the energy that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus adam s physical atoms are constantly splitting apart giving him incredible power his body maintains integrity by instantly re merging these atoms but extreme use of his powers can interfere with this process and cause captain atom s form to become unstable this leads to a fear that at some point captain atom s brain might lose its molecular stability and he will not be able to fix it before it impairs his consciousness or causes him to suffer some form of brain death 31 in the new reality nathaniel adam has been only captain atom for a few months and is still exploring his abilities constantly learning new facets to them such as his ability to perceive wireless transmissions from cell phones and computers 32 he frequently returns to the continuum so that dr megala and the staff can help him further understand his abilities and occasionally so they can stabilize his body when he seems to be having problems the world at large looks on captain atom with suspicion due to uncertainty about his agenda and the nature of his abilities some fear that he is leaking radiation and potentially poisoning those he comes into contact with several have remarked that the justice league may have rejected captain atom for membership due to suspicion of how dangerous he is 33 despite this nathaniel chooses to try and use his powers to help others on earth clandestinely if need be during a fight with megala who had taken control of firestorm s body atom is forced to absorb a massive amount of energy released which splits his molecules apart into the timestream one of these pieces is found in the 31st century where he names himself nathaniel adym 34 adym had become an agent of echo a covert branch of the science police assigned to monitor the timestream 35 as part of his duties he had interacted with members of the legion of super heroes stranded in the past in legion lost along with his subordinates agent jocelyn lure and agent yera allon adym is last seen escaping the threat of

went into dr megala s subterranean suppression dome but seemingly exploded 37 the world believed nathaniel adam was killed in a blast however adam took a subatomic trip through time and ended up without powers 20 years in the past 38 it is revealed that the quantum blowback sent him back in time to 1994 as a normal man 37 adam s wound distorted after being shot during an attempted car robbery and his body was encased in liquid metal 39 as a result of the time stream correcting itself he was thrown back to 2017 39 powers and abilities edit powers edit in the post crisis dc comics universe captain atom s dilustel skin is tied into the quantum field which enables him to absorb and manipulate theoretically infinite amounts of energy limited by only his willpower and imagination this energy can be used for flight which is generally faster than the speed of sound in earth s atmosphere and up to half light speed in the vacuum of space super strength shown at times to be on par with martian manhunter though another source the dc heroes roleplaying game defines his level of strength second only to superman s among the heroes of the dc universe though as monarch he was capable of effortlessly overwhelming three versions of superman durability he has survived exploding nuclear weapons and even energy sufficient to wipe out all life within the universe of earth 51 although this was his own energy self sustenance and life support allowing him to live and even speak in space and controlling energy of any form in addition to high speed flight he has been shown to possess enhanced reflexes atom s abilities stem from his link to the quantum field which provides a virtually infinite source of quantum energy which can be used for a vast number of effects he commonly manipulates his energy into force field bubbles or explosive bombs but the most common form is a simple energy blast atom has been shown to be capable of manipulating even exotic energies such as magic and has a high degree of resistance to such attacks over the years captain atom has become an expert at energy manipulation and he can fire energy blasts from any point on his body although he usually uses his hands for better aim he can fire in multiple directions at once or from every point of his body at once several times he has detonated releasing a massive amount of energy at once destroying objects within a certain radius as demonstrated by his destruction of bludhaven on more than one occasion he has used his ability to manipulate all forms of energy to prevent a foe using their own powers such as the ray and firestorm if atom absorbs too much energy at once the energy transports him uncontrollably through time depending on the type of energy absorbed he either goes forward or backward in time though he also possesses the ability to voluntarily move forward in the time stream captain atom states that through concentration he can briefly travel ahead in time about a week or so the process is exhausting and the period he can interact in the future appears to be limited to a few minutes before he returns to the present in the case of involuntary quantum jumping he is typically shown as being stuck in the time stream for as long as it takes his body to process any absorbed energy captain atom can also convert energy to matter in the same manner he manipulates energy originally he needed a pair of gloves invented by the blue beetle to do so but he has since learned to do so without them he is capable of manipulating matter on an atomic or sub atomic level at a limited scale he has used his atomic transmutation powers to turn both maul and the engineer back to their human forms this power can be used instinctively or through concentration though atom has conceded he is not very good at it in the same way he learned to access weak force energy as a consequence of his energy manipulation abilities he is able to telepathically interface with computer networks he has on occasion used this to repel telepathic intrusions by downloading information directly into other telepaths with focus and effort captain atom can increase any of his abilities to match his current willpower up to an unknown level as monarch prior to absorbing the captain atom brigade his powers and abilities were increased to such a level that he was capable of effortlessly containing several versions of powerful heroes such as superman wonder woman and several green lanterns atom has shown the capacity to absorb matter as well as energy typified by his absorption of the captain atom brigade as monarch he possessed all of his inherent abilities at much higher levels as well as teleportation and awareness of and access to different realities he was capable of storing enough energy that upon its release was capable of wiping all life from the alternate earth 51 except for its monitor and a single plant later writers and editors have introduced a radioactive aspect of captain atom s physical makeup this seems to contradict the quantum nature of atom s powers as originally introduced as he previously did not emit radiation when his skin was cut open towards the end of his series run it was speculated that captain atom is an elemental quantum elemental along with the swamp thing earth the red tornado air firestorm fire and naiad water in addition to his superhuman abilities nathaniel adam is also an experienced united states air force pilot it is notable that he is one of the few superheroes with a captain appellation that corresponds to a military rank he has actually held he is especially skilled in combat piloting is trained in military weaponry strategy and hand to hand combat 40 and speaks multiple languages including russian 41 adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the vietnam war dilustel edit captain atom s metallic shell or skin is composed of a portion of the alien being known as silver shield and is called dilustel pieces of the alien s metal body were used in project atom and on later subjects like major force and bombshell nathaniel is able to coat himself with the metal either partially or totally atom s symbiosis with the metal is such that even partially armored he is able to access the quantum field the metal is almost indestructible resistant to various degrees of damage from energy heat lasers etc only x ionizer technology can cut the metal as established when the captain atom project uses it to remove the silver shield s skin the katana wielded by the cambodian that once sliced through atom s side was also x ionized the magical guns of the crimson avenger were able to crack his skin breaking through it causes captain atom to quantum jump as if he has absorbed too much energy x ionizer edit the x ionizer is a hardening technology invented by the specialists of project atom introduced in the cary bates run of the dc comics published captain atom because of the nearly invulnerable nature of the alien metal discovered the scientists needed some way to cut it in order to perform experiments doctor heinrich megala one of the lead researchers of the project developed a device that would make the molecular lattices of an object by knitting together positive negative ion particles in such a way that it became superdense and compact this in effect makes the object nearly indestructible also any edge on an x ionized object would attain the sharpness of a monofilament enabling both it and its user to cut finer and cleaner than the most advanced blade or laser once transformed the object would then be able to cut through virtually any material including the dilustel quantum metal skin of the silver shield which was used to empower captain atom major force and bombshell 42 a mercenary known as the cambodian wore a suit of x ionized armor and uses an x ionized katana to cut through captain atom s skin in captain atom 7 43 a famous physicist and former c i a operative turned dangerous cult leader and quantum powered supervillain called the ghost theorized that properties hardened and honed by such a device undergo a form of mantling taking on properties very similar to the extra dimensional biometal belonging to the silver shield entity dc rebirth edit after dc rebirth captain atom is restored to his post crisis powers his new 52 powers have seemingly disappeared former powers edit his former drastically altered new 52 powers are a being whose atoms are constantly splitting and then reforming just as quickly releasing massive amounts of energy this surplus of power can be manipulated in a number of ways such as flight and the ability to transmute physical matter captain atom has been seen to transform lava into snow by willing it and has been able to remove cancer from a human being he can also absorb massive amounts of energy captain atom s abilities are largely nuclear in nature and involve tapping into the strong nuclear force the energy that binds protons and neutrons in the nucleus excessive or intense use of his abilities has resulted in captain atom temporarily losing his own molecular stability it is not yet known if he will be able to conquer this weakness with practice as an energy based life form captain atom s senses now operate on different levels than a normal person he is able to sense and perceive radio signals cell phone signals and other similar transmissions he can also see the energy of certain molecules such as when he notes the energy signature of the flash and remarks that his molecules seem to be sparking with fire or lightning 33 he also does not need air food or water to survive rogues gallery edit captain atom has his own enemies bolt larry bolatinsky an assassin and mercenary

present in summer nesting present all year non nesting synonyms falco chrysaëtos linnaeus 1758 falco fulvus linnaeus 1758 the golden eagle aquila chrysaetos is a bird of prey living in the northern hemisphere it is the most widely distributed species of eagle like all eagles it belongs to the family accipitridae they are one of the best known birds of prey in the northern hemisphere these birds are dark brown with lighter golden brown plumage on their napes immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and large sharp talons to hunt a variety of prey mainly hares rabbits and marmots and other ground squirrels 4 golden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200 km2 77 sq mi they build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years most breeding activities take place in the spring they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life females lay up to four eggs and then incubate them for six weeks typically one or two young survive to fledge in about three months these juvenile golden eagles usually attain full independence in the fall after which they wander widely until establishing a territory for themselves in four to five years once widespread across the holarctic it has disappeared from many areas that are heavily populated by humans despite being extirpated from or uncommon in some of its former range the species is still widespread being present in sizeable stretches of eurasia north america and parts of north africa it is the largest and least populous of the five species of true accipitrid to occur as a breeding species in both the palearctic and the nearctic 5 for centuries this species has been one of the most highly regarded birds used in falconry because of its hunting prowess the golden eagle is regarded with great mystic reverence in some ancient tribal cultures it is one of the most extensively studied species of raptor in the world in some parts of its range such as the western united states and the western palearctic contents 1 taxonomy and systematics 1 1 subspecies and distribution 2 description 2 1 size 2 2 colour 2 3 moulting 2 4 vocalisations 2 5 flight 2 6 distinguishing

landmark 1758 10th edition of systema naturae as falco chrysaetos 6 since birds were grouped largely on superficial characteristics at that time many species were grouped by linnaeus into the genus falco the type locality was given simply as europa it was later fixed to sweden it was moved to the new genus aquila by french ornithologist mathurin jacques brisson in 1760 7 aquila is latin for eagle possibly derived from aquilus dark in colour and chrysaetos is ancient greek for the golden eagle from khrusos gold and aetos eagle 8 the golden eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called booted eagles which are defined by the feature that all species have feathering over their tarsus unlike many other accipitrids which have bare legs included in this group are all species described as hawk eagles including the genera spizaetus and nisaetus as well as assorted monotypical genera such as oroaetus lophaetus stephanoaetus polemaetus lophotriorchis and ictinaetus the genus aquila is distributed across every continent but for south america and antarctica up to 20 species have been classified in the genus but more recently the taxonomic placement of some of the traditional species has been questioned traditionally the aquila eagles have been grouped superficially as largish mainly brownish or dark colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages genetic research has recently indicated the golden eagle is included in a clade with verreaux s eagle in africa as well as the gurney s eagle a gurneyi and the wedge tailed eagle clearly part of an australasian radiation of the lineage this identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large bodied species 5 more surprisingly the smaller much paler bellied sister species bonelli s eagle a fasciatus and african hawk eagle a spilogaster previously included in the genus hieraaetus have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the verreaux s and golden eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the genus aquila 4 9 10 other largish aquila species the eastern imperial the spanish imperial the tawny and the steppe eagles are now thought to be separate close knit clade which attained some similar characteristics to the prior clade via convergent evolution 9 10 genetically the spotted eagles a pomarina hastata and clanga have been discovered to be more closely related to the long crested eagle lophaetus occipitalis and the black eagle ictinaetus malayensis and many generic reassignments have been advocated 9 11 the genus hieraaetus including the booted eagle h pennatus little eagle h morphnoides and ayres s hawk eagle h ayresii consists of much smaller species that are in fact smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated spilornis serpent eagle genus this genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and is now occasionally also included in aquila although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re classification 4 10 12 the small bodied wahlberg s eagle h wahlbergi has been traditionally considered a aquila species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the hieraaetus lineage 9 13 cassin s hawk eagle h africanus is also probably closely related to the hieraaetus group rather than the spizaetus nisaetus hawk eagle group in which it was previously classified which is not known to have radiated to africa 14 subspecies and distribution a captive aquila chrysaetos canadensis shows the typical rusty coloration of the subspecies aquila chrysaetos homeyeri mhnt there are six extant subspecies of golden eagle that differ slightly in size and plumage individuals of any of the subspecies are somewhat variable and the differences between the subspecies are clinal especially in terms of body size other than these characteristics there is little variation across the range of the species 15 some recent studies have gone so far as to propose that only two subspecies be recognized based on genetic markers aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos including a c homeyeri and a c canadensis including a c japonica a c daphanea and a c kamtschatica 16 aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos linnaeus 1758 sometimes referred to as the european golden eagle 17 this is the nominate subspecies this subspecies is found almost throughout europe including the british isles mainly in scotland the majority of scandinavia southern and northernmost france italy and austria in eastern europe it is found from estonia to romania greece serbia and bulgaria in southeastern europe it is also distributed through european russia reportedly reaching its eastern limit around the yenisei river in russia also ranging south at a similar longitude into western kazakhstan and northern iran 4 15 male wing length is from 56 5 to 67 cm 22 2 to 26 4 in averaging 62 cm 24 in and female wing length is from 61 5 to 71 2 cm 24 2 to 28 0 in averaging 67 cm 26 in males weigh from 2 8 to 4 6 kg 6 2 to 10 1 lb averaging 3 69 kg 8 1 lb and females weigh from 3 8 to 6 7 kg 8 4 to 14 8 lb averaging 5 17 kg 11 4 lb 4 15 the male of this subspecies has a wingspan of 1 89 to 2 15 m 6 ft 2 in to 7 ft 1 in with an average of 2 02 m 6 ft 8 in with the female s typical wingspan range is 2 12 to 2 2 m 6 ft 11 in to 7 ft 3 in with an average of 2 16 m 7 ft 1 in 17 this is a medium sized subspecies and is the palest as opposed to golden eagles found further east in eurasia the adults of this subspecies are a tawny golden brown on the upperside the nape patch is often gleaming golden in color and the feathers here are exceptionally long 5 15 18 aquila chrysaetos homeyeri severtzov 1888 commonly known as the iberian golden eagle this subspecies occurs in almost the entirety of the iberian peninsula as well as the island of crete though it is absent from the rest of continental europe it also ranges in north africa in a narrow sub coastal strip from morocco to tunisia a completely isolated population of golden eagles is found in ethiopia s bale mountains at the southern limit of the species range worldwide although this latter population has not been formally assigned to a subspecies there is a high probability that it belongs with a c homeyeri this subspecies also ranges in much of asia minor mainly turkey spottily through the middle east and the arabian peninsula into northern yemen and oman to its eastern limits throughout the caucasus 19 much of iran and north to southwestern kazakhstan 4 15 male wing length is from 55 to 64 3 cm 21 7 to 25 3 in averaging 59 cm 23 in and female wing length is from 60 to 70 5 cm 23 6 to 27 8 in averaging 64 cm 25 in weight is from 2 9 to 6 kg 6 4 to 13 2 lb with no known reports of average masses 4 15 this subspecies is slightly smaller and darker plumaged than the nominate subspecies but it is not as dark as the golden eagles found further to the east the forehead and crown are dark brownish with the nape patch being short feathered and a relatively light rusty color 20 aquila chrysaetos daphanea severtzov 1888 known variously as the asian golden eagle himalayan golden eagle or berkut 21 this subspecies is distributed in central kazakhstan eastern iran and the easternmost caucasus distributed to manchuria and central china and along the himalayas from northern pakistan to bhutan and discontinuing in northeastern myanmar rarely ranging over into northernmost india 4 15 22 this subspecies is the largest on average male wing length is from 60 to 68 cm 24 to 27 in averaging 64 cm 25 in and female wing length is from 66 to 72 cm 26 to 28 in averaging 70 cm 28 in no range of body weights are known but males will weigh approximately 4 05 kg 8 9 lb and females 6 35 kg 14 0 lb 4 15 although the wingspan of this subspecies reportedly averages 2 21 m 7 ft 3 in some individuals can have much longer wings 21 one female berkut had an authenticated wingspan of 2 81 m 9 ft 3 in although she was a captive specimen 21 it is generally the second darkest subspecies being blackish on the back the forehead and crown are dark with a blackish cap near the end of the crown the feathers of the nape and top neck are rich brown red the nape feathers are slightly shorter than in the nominate subspecies and are similar in length to a c homeyeri 23 24 aquila chrysaetos japonica severtzov 1888 commonly known as the japanese golden eagle this subspecies is found in northern japan the islands of honshu hokkaido and discontinuously in kyushu and undefined parts of korea 4 15 male wing length is from 58 to 59 5 cm 22 8 to 23 4 in averaging 59 cm 23 in and female wing length is from 62 to 64 5 cm 24 4 to 25 4 in averaging 63 cm 25 in no range of body weights are known but males will weigh approximately 2 5 kg 5 5 lb and females 3 25 kg 7 2 lb this is by far the smallest bodied subspecies it is also the darkest with even adults being a slaty grayish black on the back and crown and juveniles being similar but with darker black plumage contrasting with brownish color and white scaling on the wings flank and tail this subspecies has bright rufous nape feathers that are quite loose and long adult japanese golden eagles often maintain extensive white mottling on the inner webs of the tail that tend to be more typical of juvenile eagles in other subspecies 4 15 aquila chrysaetos canadensis linnaeus 1758 commonly known as the north american golden eagle occupies the species entire range in north america which comprises the great majority of alaska western canada western united states and mexico the species is found breeding occasionally in all canadian provinces but for nova scotia it is currently absent in the eastern united states as breeding species east of a line from north dakota down through westernmost nebraska and oklahoma to west texas the southern limits of its range are in central mexico from the guadalajara area in the west to the tampico area in the east it is the mexican eagle featured on the coat of arms of mexico 25 it is the subspecies with the largest breeding range and is probably the most numerous subspecies especially if a c kamtschatica is included 4 15 male wing length is from 59 1 to 64 cm 23 3 to 25 2 in averaging 61 cm 24 in and female wing length is from 60 1 to 67 4 cm 23 7 to 26 5 in averaging 65 cm 26 in 4 15 26 the average wingspan in both sexes is about 2 04 m 6 ft 8 in 5 males weigh from 2 5 to 4 47 kg 5 5 to 9 9 lb averaging 3 48 kg 7 7 lb and females typically weigh from 3 6 to 6 4 kg 7 9 to 14 1 lb averaging 4 91 kg 10 8 lb 4 15 the subspecies does not appear to follow bergmann s rule the rule that widely distributed organisms are larger bodied further away from the equator as specimens of both sexes from idaho had a mean weight of 4 22 kg 9 3 lb and where slightly heavier than those from alaska with a mean weight of 3 76 kg 8 3 lb 4 5 it is medium sized being generally intermediate in size between the nominate and a c homeyeri but with much overlap it is blackish to dark brown on the back the long feathers of the nape and top neck are rusty reddish and slightly narrower and darker than in the nominate subspecies 15 27 aquila chrysaetos kamtschatica severtzov 1888 sometimes referred to as the siberian golden eagle or the kamchatkan golden eagle this subspecies ranges from western siberia where overlap with a c chrysaetos is probable across most of russia including the altay spilling over into northern mongolia to the kamchatka peninsula and the anadyrsky district this subspecies is often included in a c canadensis 4 15 male wing length is from 61 8 to 70 5 cm 24 3 to 27 8 in averaging 64 cm 25 in and female wing length is from 65 to 72 cm 26 to 28 in averaging 69 cm 27 in 28 no weights are known in this subspecies 4 the coloration of these eagles is almost exactly the same as in a c canadensis the main difference is that this subspecies is much larger in size being nearly the equal of a c daphanea if going on wing length 15 the larger middle pleistocene golden eagles of france and possibly elsewhere are referred to a paleosubspecies aquila chrysaetos bonifacti and the huge specimens of the late pleistocene of liko cave crete have been named aquila chrysaetos simurgh weesie 1988 29 30 31 similarly an ancestral golden eagle with a heavier broader skull larger wings and shorter legs when compared to modern birds has been found in the la brea tar pits of southern california 32 description size the foot and talons of a golden eagle the golden eagle is a very large raptor 66 to 102 centimetres 26 to 40 in in length its wings are broad and the wingspan is 1 8 to 2 34 metres 5 ft 11 in to 7 ft 8 in 33 15 34 35 the wingspan of golden eagles is the fifth largest among living eagle species 15 females are larger than males with a bigger difference in larger subspecies females of the large himalayan golden eagles are about 37 heavier than males and have nearly 9 longer wings whereas in the smaller japanese golden eagles females are only 26 heavier with around 6 longer wings 4 36 in the largest subspecies a c daphanea males and females weigh typically 4 05 and 6 35 kg 8 9 and 14 0 lb respectively in the smallest subspecies a c japonica males weigh 2 5 kg 5 5 lb and females 3 25 kg 7 2 lb 4 in the species overall males average around 3 6 kg 7 9 lb and females around 5 1 kg 11 lb 37 the maximum size of golden eagles is debated large subspecies are the heaviest representatives of the genus aquila and this species is on average the seventh heaviest living eagle species the golden eagle is the second heaviest breeding eagle in north america europe and africa and the fourth heaviest in asia 5 15 for some time the largest known mass authenticated for a wild female was the specimen from the a c chrysaetos subspecies which weighed around 6 7 kg 15 lb and spanned 2 55 m 8 ft 4 in across the wings 21 american golden eagles are typically somewhat smaller than the large eurasian species but a massive female that was banded and released in 2006 around wyoming s bridger teton national forest became the heaviest wild golden eagle on record at 7 7 kg 17 lb 38 captive birds have been measured with a wingspan of 2 81 m 9 ft 3 in and a mass of 12 1 kg 27 lb though this mass was for an eagle bred for falconry which tend to be unnaturally heavy 21 the standard measurements of the species include a wing chord length of 52 72 cm 20 28 in a tail length of 26 5 38 cm 10 4 15 0 in and a tarsus length of 9 4 12 2 cm 3 7 4 8 in 15 the culmen upper ridge of beak reportedly averages around 4 5 cm 1 8 in with a range of 3 6 to 5 cm 1 4 to 2 0 in the bill length from the gape measures around 6 cm 2 4 in 39 40 the long straight and powerful hallux claw hind claw can range from 4 5 to 6 34 cm 1 77 to 2 50 in about one centimetre longer than in a bald eagle and a little more than one centimetre less than a harpy eagle 26 41 42 colour subadult showing white in tail and dark neck adults of both sexes have similar plumage and are primarily dark brown with some grey on the inner wing and tail and a paler typically golden colour on the back of the crown and nape that gives the species its common name 43 unlike other aquila species where the tarsal feathers are typically similar in colour to the rest of the plumage the tarsal feathers of golden eagles tend to be paler ranging from light golden to white 4 in addition some full grown birds especially in north america have white epaulettes on the upper part of each scapular feather tract 5 44 the bill is dark at the tip fading to a lighter horn colour with a yellow cere 45 as in many accipitrids the bare portion of the feet is yellow 15 there are subtle differences in colouration among subspecies described below juvenile golden eagles are similar to adults but tend to be darker appearing black on the back especially in east asia they have a less faded colour young birds are white for about two thirds of their tail length ending with a broad black band 36 occasionally juvenile eagles have white patches on the remiges at the bases of the inner primaries and the outer secondaries forming a crescent marking on the wings which tends to be divided by darker feathers 4 46 rarely juvenile birds may have only traces of white on the tail compared to the relatively consistently white tail the white patches on the wing are extremely variable some juveniles have almost no white visible juveniles of less than 12 months of age tend to have the most white in their plumage 44 by their second summer the white underwing coverts are usually replaced by a characteristic rusty brown colour by the third summer the upper wing coverts are largely replaced by dark brown feathers although not all feathers moult at once which leaves many juvenile birds with a grizzled pattern the tail follows a similar pattern of maturation to the wings 44 46 due to the variability between individuals juvenile eagles cannot be reliably aged by sight alone 47 many golden eagles still have white on the tail during their first attempt at nesting 48 the final adult plumage is not fully attained until the birds are between 5 and a half and 6 and a half years old 47 moulting captive adult of the north american subspecies aquila chrysaetos canadensis this species moults gradually beginning in march or april until september or october each year moulting usually decreases in winter moult of the contour feathers begins on the head and neck region and progresses along the feather tracts in a general front to back direction feathers on head neck back and scapulars may be replaced annually with large feathers of the wing and tail moult begins with the innermost feathers and proceeds outwards in a straightforward manner known as descendant moult 44 vocalisations golden eagles are often silent while many accipitrids are not known for their strong voices golden eagles have a particular tendency for silence even while breeding 17 that being said some vocalization has been recorded usually centering around the nesting period the voice of the golden eagle is considered weak high and shrill has been called quite pathetic and puppy like and seems incongruous with the formidable size and nature of the species 15 most known vocalisations seem to function as contact calls between eagles sometimes adults to their offspring occasionally territorial birds to intruders and rarely between a breeding pair in western montana nine distinct calls were noted a chirp a seeir a pssa a skonk a cluck a wonk a honk and a hiss 49 flight in flight golden eagle flying in dihedral with food golden eagles are sometimes considered the best fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds 17 they are equipped with broad long wings with somewhat finger like indentations on the tips of the wing 15 golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral which means the wings are often held in a slight upturned v shape 15 when they need to flap golden eagles appear at their most laboured but this is less common than soaring or gliding 4 flapping flight usually consists of 6 8 deep wing beats interspersed with 2 3 second glides 4 while soaring the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread 50 a typical unhurried soaring speed in golden eagles is around 45 52 kilometres per hour 28 32 mph 51 when hunting or displaying the golden eagle can glide very fast reaching speeds of up to 190 kilometres per hour 120 mph 4 50 when stooping diving in the direction of prey or during territorial displays the eagle holds its legs up against its tail and holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body when diving after prey a golden eagle can reach 240 to 320 kilometres per hour 150 to 200 mph although less agile and manoeuvrable the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon s stooping and gliding speeds 5 52 this makes the golden eagle one of the two fastest living animals 21 although most flight in golden eagles has a clear purpose e g territoriality hunting some flights such as those by solitary birds or between well established breeding pairs seem to be play 5 17 53 distinguishing from other species golden eagles are readily distinguished by their brown plumage paler than most other aquila and pale nape patch size readily distinguishes this species from most other raptors when it is seen well most other raptors are considerably smaller buteo hawks which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the booted eagle group are often counted among the larger very common raptors however a mid sized buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle as an adult female eagle has about double the wingspan and about five times the weight buteos are also usually distinctly paler below although some species occur in dark morphs which can be darker than a golden eagle 15 54 among raptorial birds that share the golden eagle s range only some old world vultures and the california condor are distinctly larger with longer broader wings typically held more evenly in a slower less forceful flight they often have dramatically different colour patterns in north america the golden eagle may be confused with the turkey vulture from a great distance as it is a large species that like the golden eagle often flies with a pronounced dihedral the turkey vulture can be distinguished by its less controlled forceful flying style they frequently rock back and forth unsteadily in even moderate winds and its smaller thinner body much smaller head and at closer range its slaty black brown colour and silvery wing secondaries 55 compared to haliaeetus eagles the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk like and lack the flat plank like wing positioning seen in the other genus 55 large northern haliaeetus species usually have a larger bill and larger head which protrudes more distinctly than a golden eagle s in flight the tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of haliaeetus eagles appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight whereas in the other eagles the head is often more than twice the length of the tail 55 confusion is most likely between juvenile haliaeetus and golden eagles as the adult golden has a more solidly golden brown coloration and all haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase juvenile golden eagles can have large patches of white on their wings and tail that are quite different from the random sometimes large and splotchy looking distribution of white typical of juvenile haliaeetus 15 55 distinguishing the golden eagle from other aquila eagles in eurasia is more difficult identification may rely on the golden eagle s relatively long tail and patterns of white or grey on the wings and tail unlike golden eagles other aquila eagles do not generally fly in a pronounced dihedral at close range the golden to rufous nape shawl of the golden eagle is distinctive from other aquila most other aquila eagles have darker plumage although the smaller tawny eagle is often paler than the golden eagle the overlap in range is verified only in bale mountains ethiopia among eurasian aquila the adult eastern imperial and spanish imperial eagle come closest to reaching the size of golden eagles but both are distinguished by their longer necks flatter wings in flight white markings on their shoulder forewing coverts paler cream straw coloured nape patch and generally darker colouration juvenile imperial eagles are much paler overall caramel cream in the spanish cream and tawny streaks in the eastern and are not likely to be confused 15 steppe eagles can also approach golden eagles in size but are more compact and smaller headed with little colour variation to their dark earth brown plumage apart from juvenile birds which have distinctive cream coloured bands running through their coverts and secondaries 5 verreaux s eagles are most similar in size and body shape to the golden the body of the verreaux s eagle being slightly longer overall but marginally less heavy and long winged than the golden eagle s 15 the plumage is very distinctly different however as verreaux s eagles are almost entirely jet black except for some striking contrasting white on the wing primaries shoulders and upper wing 15 this closely related species is known to co occur with the golden eagle only in the bale mountains of ethiopia 4 other booted eagles in the golden eagle s range are unlikely to be confused due to differences in size and form the only species in the genus aquila that exceeds the golden eagle in average wingspan and length is the wedge tailed eagle of australasia however the wedge tailed eagle is a slightly less heavy bird 21 habitat and distribution beinn mhor on the isle of mull scotland is typical golden eagle habitat rugged and mountainous an adult flying above himalayan mountains from shingba rhododendron sanctuary in sikkim india golden eagles are fairly adaptable in habitat but often reside in areas with a few shared ecological characteristics they are best suited to hunting in open or semi open areas and search them out year around native vegetation seems to be attractive to them and they typically avoid developed areas of any type from urban to agricultural as well as heavily forested regions in desolate areas e g the southern yukon they can occur regularly at roadkills and garbage dumps 56 the largest numbers of golden eagles are found in mountainous regions today with many eagles doing a majority of their hunting and nesting on rock formations however they are not solely tied to high elevations and can breed in lowlands if the local habitats are suitable below are more detailed descriptions of habitats occupied by golden eagles in both continents where they occur 4 eurasia portrait of a golden eagle near the alps in the arctic fringe of eurasia golden eagles occur along the edge of the tundra and the taiga from the kola peninsula to anadyr in eastern siberia nesting in forests and hunting over nearby arctic heathland typical vegetation is stunted fragmented larch woodland merging into low birch willow scrub and various heathland in the rocky wet windy maritime climate of scotland ireland and western scandinavia the golden eagle dwells in mountains these areas include upland grasslands blanket bog and sub arctic heaths but also fragmented woodland and woodland edge including boreal forests in western europe golden eagle habitat is dominated by open rough grassland heath and bogs and rocky ridges spurs crags scree slopes and grand plateaux in sweden finland the baltic states belarus and almost the entire distribution in russia all the way to the pacific ocean golden eagles occur sparsely in lowland taiga forest these areas are dominated by stands of evergreens such as pine larch and spruce occasionally supplemented by birch and alder stands in southern scandinavia and the baltic states this is largely marginal country for golden eagles and they occur where tree cover is thin and abuts open habitat golden eagle taiga habitat usually consists of extensive peatland formations caused by poorly drained soils in central europe golden eagles today occur almost exclusively in the major mountain ranges such as the pyrenees alps carpathians and the caucasus here the species nests near the tree line and hunt subalpine and alpine pastures grassland and heath above golden eagles also occur in moderately mountainous habitat along the mediterranean sea from the iberian peninsula and the atlas mountains in morocco to greece turkey and iraq this area is characterized by low mountains mediterranean maquis vegetation and sub temperate open woodland the local pine oak vegetation with a variety of sclerophyllous shrubs are well adapted to prolonged summer droughts from turkey and the southern caspian sea to the foothills of the hindu kush mountains in afghanistan the typical golden eagle habitat is temperate desert like mountain ranges surrounded by steppe landscapes interspersed with forest here the climate is colder and more continental than around the mediterranean golden eagles occupy the alpine ranges from the altai mountains and the pamir mountains to tibet in the great himalayan massif and xinjiang china where they occupy the tien shan range citation needed in these mountain ranges the species often lives at very high elevations living above tree line at more than 2 500 m 8 200 ft often nesting in rocky scree and hunting in adjacent meadows in tibet golden eagles inhabit high ridges and passes in the lhasa river watershed where they regularly join groups of soaring himalayan vultures gyps himalayensis 57 one golden eagle was recorded circling at 6 190 m 20 310 ft above sea level in khumbu in may 1975 58 in the mountains of japan and korea the golden eagle occupies deciduous scrub woodland and carpet like stands of siberian dwarf pine pinus pumila that merge into grasslands and alpine heathland the golden eagle occurs in mountains from the adrar plateau in mauritania to northern yemen and oman where the desert habitat is largely bereft of vegetation but offers many rocky plateaus to support both the eagles and their prey in israel their habitat is mainly rocky slopes and wide wadi areas chiefly in desert and to a lesser extent in semi desert and mediterranean climates extending to open areas 59 in northeastern africa the habitat is often of a sparse desert like character and is quite similar to the habitat in middle east and the arabian peninsula in ethiopia s bale mountains where the vegetation is more lush and the climate is clearly less arid than in northeastern africa the golden eagle occupies verdant mountains 4 north america the biomes occupied by golden eagles are roughly concurrent with those of eurasia in western and northern alaska and northern canada to the ungava peninsula in quebec the eagles occupy the arctic fringe of north america the species does not range into the true high arctic tundra where open canopy gives way to dwarf shrub heathland with cottongrass and tussock tundra in land locked areas of the sub arctic golden eagles are by far the largest raptor from the alaska range to washington and oregon it is often found in high mountains above the tree line or on bluffs and cliffs along river valleys below the tree line 60 61 in washington state golden eagles can be found in clear cut sections of otherwise dense coniferous forest zones with relatively little annual precipitation 62 from east of the canadian rocky mountains to the mountains of labrador the golden eagle is found in small numbers in boreal forest peatlands and similar mixed woodland areas in the foothills of the rocky mountains in the united states are plains and prairies where golden eagles are widespread especially where there is a low human presence here grassland on low rolling hills and flat plains are typical interrupted only by cottonwood stands around river valleys and wetlands where the eagles may build their nests golden eagles also occupy the desert like great basin from southern idaho to northern arizona and new mexico in this habitat trees are generally absent other than junipers with vegetation being dominated by sagebrush artemisia and other low shrub species although the vegetation varies a bit more similar habitat is occupied by golden eagles in mexico 63 64 65 however golden eagles are typically absent in north america from true deserts like the sonora desert where annual precipitation is less than 20 cm 7 9 in 66 golden eagles occupy the mountains and coastal areas of california and baja california in mexico where hot dry summers and moist winters are typical the golden eagles here often nest in chaparral and oak woodland oak savanna and grassland amongst low rolling hill typified by diverse vegetation 67 in the eastern united states the species once bred widely in the appalachian plateau near burns open marshes meadows bogs and lakes 68 69 in eastern north america the species still breeds on the gaspe peninsula quebec until 1999 a pair of golden eagles were still known to nest in maine but they are now believed to be absent as a breeding bird from the eastern united states 4 the golden eagles who breed in eastern canada winter on montane grass and heath fields in the appalachian plateau region especially in pennsylvania new york west virginia maryland and virginia most sightings in the eastern united states recently are concentrated within or along southwestern border of the appalachian plateau 30 of records and within the coastal plain physiographic region 33 of records 70 though they do regularly nest in the marsh like peatland of the boreal forest golden eagles are not generally associated with wetlands and in fact they can be found near some of the most arid spots on earth in the wintering population of eastern united states however they are often associated with steep river valleys reservoirs and marshes in inland areas as well as estuarine marshlands barrier islands managed wetlands sounds and mouths of major river systems in coastal areas these wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation large concentrations of prey and the general absence of human disturbance 70 in the midwestern united states they are not uncommon during winter near reservoirs and wildlife refuges that provide foraging opportunities at waterfowl concentrations 71 feeding main article dietary biology of the golden eagle golden eagles usually hunt during daylight hours but were recorded hunting from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset during the breeding season in southwestern idaho 72 the hunting success rate of golden eagles was calculated in idaho showing that out of 115 hunting attempts 20 were successful in procuring prey 73 a fully grown golden eagle requires about 230 to 250 g 8 1 to 8 8 oz of food per day but in the life of most eagles there are cycles of feast and famine and eagles have been known to go without food for up to a week and then gorge on up to 900 g 2 0 lb at one sitting 5 the diet of golden eagles is composed primarily of small mammals such as rabbits hares ground squirrels prairie dogs and marmots they also eat other birds usually of medium size such as gamebirds 74 reptiles and fish in smaller numbers golden eagles occasionally capture large prey including seals ungulates coyotes and badgers they have also been known to capture large flying birds such as geese or cranes 75 they have also been known to prey on other raptors including owls and falcons 76 activity and movements in spain golden eagles such as this one in the province of ávila are sedentary despite the dramatic ways in which they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful in idaho adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78 of daylight whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85 of the day 77 during the peak of summer in utah hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9 00 and 11 00 am and 4 00 and 6 00 pm with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting 17 when conditions are heavily anticyclonic there is less soaring during the day 4 during winter in scotland golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion 4 in the more wooded environments of norway during autumn and winter much less aerial activity is reported since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour hunting rather than looking for carrion 78 golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together the largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter s night in eastern idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles 79 migration most populations of golden eagles are sedentary but the species is actually a partial migrant golden eagles are very hardy species being well adapted to cold climates however they cannot abide declining available food sources in the northern stretches of their range eagles raised at latitudes greater than 60 n are usually migratory though a short migration may be untaken by those who breed or hatch at about 50 n 80 during migration they often use soaring gliding flight rather than powered flight 80 in finland most banded juveniles move between 1 000 and 2 000 km 620 and 1 240 mi due south whereas adults stay locally through winter further east conditions are too harsh for even wintering territorial adults 4 golden eagles that breed from the kola peninsula to anadyr in the russian far east migrate south to winter on the russian and mongolian steppes and the north china plains the flat relatively open landscapes in these regions hold relatively few resident breeding golden eagles 81 similarly the entire population of golden eagles from northern and central alaska and northern canada migrates south at mount lorette in alberta approximately 4 000 golden eagles may pass during the fall the largest recorded migration of golden eagles on earth 82 here the mountain ranges are relatively moderate and consistent thus being reliable for thermals and updrafts which made long distance migrating feasible 82 birds hatched in denali national park in alaska traveled from 818 to 4 815 km 508 to 2 992 mi to their winter ranges in western north america 80 these western migrants may winter anywhere from southern alberta and montana to new mexico and arizona and from inland california to nebraska adults who bred in northeastern hudson bay area of canada reached their wintering grounds which range from central michigan to southern pennsylvania to northeastern alabama in 26 to 40 days with arrival dates from november to early december 83 the departure dates from wintering grounds are variable in southwestern canada they leave their wintering grounds by 6 april to 8 may the mean being 21 april in southwestern idaho wintering birds leave from 20 march to 13 april mean of 29 march and in the southwestern united states wintering birds may depart by early march 4 80 84 elsewhere in the species breeding range golden eagles i e those who breed in the contiguous western united states all of europe but for northern scandinavia north africa and all of asia but for northern russia are non migratory and tend to remain within striking distance of their breeding territories throughout the year 15 in scotland among all recovered banded golden eagles 36 out of 1000 the rest mostly died or disappeared the average distance between ringing and recovery was 44 km 27 mi averaging 63 km 39 mi in juveniles and 36 km 22 mi in older birds 4 in the dry southwestern united states golden eagles tend to move to higher elevations once the breeding season is complete 53 in north africa populations breeding at lower latitudes like morocco are mostly sedentary although some occasionally disperse after breeding to areas outside of the normal breeding range 85 territoriality two golden eagles in an aerial conflict over their home ranges the upper bird clearly a juvenile territoriality is believed to be the primary cause of interactions and confrontations between non paired golden eagles golden eagles maintain some of the largest known home ranges or territories of any bird species but there is much variation of home range size across the range possibly dictated by food abundance and habitat preference home ranges in most of the range can vary from 20 to 200 km2 7 7 to 77 2 sq mi 86 in san diego county in california the home ranges varied from 49 to 137 km2 19 to 53 sq mi with an average of 93 km2 36 sq mi 87 however some home ranges have been much smaller such as in southwestern idaho where possibly due to an abundance of jackrabbits home ranges as small as 4 85 km2 1 87 sq mi are maintained 64 the smallest known home ranges on record for golden eagles are in the bale mountains of ethiopia where they range from 1 5 to 9 km2 0 58 to 3 47 sq mi 88 46 of undulating displays in montana occurred shortly after the juvenile eagles left their parents range suggesting that some residents defend and maintain territories year round 89 elsewhere it is stated that home ranges are less strictly maintained during winter but hunting grounds are basically exclusive 4 in israel and scotland aggressive encounters peaked from winter until just before egg laying and were less common during the nesting season 4 90 threat displays include undulating flight and aggressive direct flapping flight with exaggerated downstrokes 49 most displays by mature golden eagles 67 for males and 76 for females occur rather than around the nest at the edge of their home ranges 77 in western norway most recorded undulating flight displays occur during the pre laying period in late winter early spring 78 display flights seem to be triggered by the presence of other golden eagles 4 the use of display flights has a clear benefit in that it lessens the need for physical confrontations which can be fatal 77 usually non breeding birds are treated aggressively by the golden eagle maintaining their home range normally being chased to the apparent limit of the range but with no actual physical contact 4 the territorial flight of the adult golden eagle is sometimes preceded or followed by intense bouts of undulating displays the invader often responds by rolling over and presenting talons to the aggressor rarely the two eagles will lock talons and tumble through the air sometimes fall several revolutions and in some cases even tumble to the ground before releasing their grip 78 91 in some parts of the alps the golden eagle population has reached the saturation point in appropriate habitat and apparently violent confrontations are more common than in other parts of the range 92 golden eagles may express their aggression via body language while perched typically the adult female when confronted by an intruding eagle the head and body are upright feathers on head and neck are erect the wings may be slightly spread and beak open often accompanied by intense gaze they then often engage in a similar posture with wings spread wide and oriented toward the threat sometimes rocking back on tail and even flopping over onto the back with talons extended upward as defense such behavior may be accompanied by wing slap against the threatening intruder 49 when approached by an intruder the defending eagle turns away partially spreads tail lowers head and remains still adults on the nest may lower head and freeze when approached by a person or a helicopter 49 females in israel displayed more than males and mostly against interspecific intruders males apparently displayed primarily as part of courtship 90 five of 7 aggressive encounters at carcasses during winter in norway were won by females in 15 of 21 conflicts the younger bird dominated an older conspecific 93 however obvious juvenile eagles apparent to the adult eagles due to the amount of white on their wings and tail are sometimes allowed to penetrate deeply into a pair s home range and all parties commonly ignore each other 94 95 in north dakota it was verified that parent eagles were not aggressive towards their own young after the nesting period and some juveniles stayed on their parents territory until their 2nd spring and then left by their own accord 96 reproduction main article reproduction and life cycle of the golden eagle eyrie in hollow at left center in the valley of the siagne de la pare alpes maritimes france aquila chrysaetos mhnt golden eagles usually mate for life a breeding pair is formed in a courtship display this courtship includes undulating displays by both in the pair with the male bird picking up a piece of rock or a small stick and dropping it only to enter into a steep dive and catch it in mid air repeating the maneuver 3 or more times the female takes a clump of earth and drops and catches it in the same fashion 4 27 golden eagles typically build several eyries within their territory preferring cliffs and use them alternately for several years their nesting areas are characterized by the extreme regularity of the nest spacing 97 mating and egg laying timing for golden eagle is variable depending on the locality copulation normally lasts 10 20 seconds mating seems to occur around 40 46 days before the initial egg laying 4 the golden eagle chick may be heard from within the egg 15 hours before it begins hatching after the first chip is broken off of the egg there is no activity for around 27 hours hatching activity accelerates and the shell is broken apart in 35 hours the chick is completely free in 37 hours 49 in the first 10 days chicks mainly lie down on the nest substrate 49 they are capable of preening on their second day but their parents keep them warm until around 20 days 4 they grow considerably weighing around 500 g 1 1 lb 98 they also start sitting up more 49 around 20 days of age the chicks generally start standing which becomes the main position over the course of the next 40 days 49 the whitish down continues until around 25 days of age at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance 4 after hatching 80 of food items and 90 of food biomass is captured and brought to the nest by the adult male fledging occurs at 66 to 75 days of age in idaho and 70 to 81 days in scotland the first attempted flight departure after fledging can be abrupt with the young jumping off and using a series of short stiff wing beats to glide downward or being blown out of nest while wing flapping 18 to 20 days after first fledging the young eagles will take their first circling flight but they cannot gain height as efficiently as their parents until approximately 60 days after fledging in cumbria young golden eagles were first seen hunting large prey 59 days after fledging 75 to 85 days after fledging the young were largely independent of parents generally breeding success seems to be greatest where prey is available in abundance 4 longevity golden eagles are fairly long living birds in natural conditions if they survive their first few years the survival rate of raptorial birds tends to increase with larger body size with a 30 50 annual loss of population rate in small falcons accipiters a 15 25 loss of population rate in medium sized hawks e g buteos or kites and a 5 or less rate of loss in eagles and vultures the oldest known wild golden eagle was a bird banded in sweden which was recovered 32 years later 4 the longest lived known wild golden eagle in north america was 31 years and 8 months 99 the longest lived known captive golden eagle a specimen in europe survived to 46 years of age 100 the estimated adult annual survival rate on the isle of skye in scotland is around 97 5 101 when this extrapolated into an estimated lifespan this results in 39 and half years as the average for adult golden eagles in this area which is probably far too high an estimate 4 survival rates are usually much lower in juvenile eagles than in adult eagles in the western rocky mountains 50 of golden eagles banded in the nest died by the time they were 2 and a half years and an estimated 75 died by the time they were 5 years old 102 near a wind turbine facility in west central california estimated survival rates based on conventional telemetry of 257 individuals were 84 for first year eagles 79 for 1 to 3 year olds and adult floaters and 91 for breeders with no difference in survival rates between sexes 67 survival rates may be lower for migrating populations of golden eagles 103 a 19 34 survival rate was estimated for juvenile eagles from denali national park in their first 11 months 103 the average life expectancy of golden eagles in germany is 13 years extrapolated from a reported mere 92 5 survival rate 104 natural mortality natural sources of mortality are largely reported in anecdotes on rare occasions golden eagles have been killed by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores including the aforementioned wolverine snow leopard cougar brown bear and white tailed eagle attacks most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles nestlings and fledglings are more likely to be killed by another predator than free flying juveniles and adults it has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators especially birds which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man made climbing equipment in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans jeff watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt 4 however there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests 4 occasionally golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self defense there is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum it had attempted to hunt 105 on the isle of rùm in scotland there are a few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death probably the result of a doe having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn 106 although usually well out matched by the predator occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle an attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight 107 there is at least one case in scotland of a golden eagle dying after being oiled by a northern fulmar a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator s ability to fly 108 of natural sources of death starvation is probably under reported 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in denali national park had died of starvation 103 of 36 deaths of golden eagles in idaho 55 were possibly attributable to natural causes specifically 8 26 from unknown trauma 3 10 from disease and 6 19 from unknown causes 109 of 266 golden eagle deaths in spain only 6 were from unknown causes that could not be directly attributed to human activities 110 avian cholera caused by bacteria pasteurella multocida infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease the protozoan trichomonas sp caused the deaths of four fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in idaho 111 several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in japan 112 a captive eagle died from two malignant tumors one in the liver and one in the kidney 113 killing permits in december 2016 the us fish and wildlife service proposed allowing wind turbine electric generation companies to kill golden eagles without penalty so long as companies take steps to minimize the losses if issued the permits would last 30 years six times the current 5 year permits 114 115 in human culture main article golden eagles in human culture 1870s illustration of burkut falconers in kazakhstan human beings have been fascinated by the golden eagle as early as the beginning of recorded history most early recorded cultures regarded the golden eagle with reverence in pre hispanic mesoamerica the eagle was a major mexica aztec symbol the tribal and sun god huitzilopochtli had told his people that when they saw the sun i e huitzilopochtli in the form of an eagle perched on a cactus whose fruit was red and shaped like a human heart there they should build their city tenochtitlan the scene shown on a well known sculpture in early manuscripts and on the present day mexican flag surely had astronomical and geomantic as well as mythological meaning 116 it was only after the industrial revolution when sport hunting became widespread and commercial stock farming became internationally common that humans started to widely regard golden eagles as a threat to their livelihoods this period also brought about the firearm and industrialized poisons which made it easy for humans to kill the evasive and powerful birds in 2017 the french army trained golden eagles to catch drones 117 the golden eagle is officially utah s state bird of prey status and conservation main article status and conservation of the golden eagle in flight in czech republic at one time the golden eagle lived in a great majority of temperate europe north asia north america north africa and japan although widespread and quite secure in some areas in many parts of the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas the number of golden eagles from around the range is estimated to be between 170 000 and 250 000 while the estimates of breeding pairs are from 60 000 to 100 000 4 118 it has the largest known range of any member of its family with a range estimated at 140 million square kilometers if its taxonomic order is considered it is the second most wide ranging species after only the osprey pandion haliaetus 2 119 few other eagle species are as numerous though some species like the tawny eagle wedge tailed eagle and bald eagle have total estimated populations of a similar size to the golden eagle s despite their more restricted distributions 5 15 the world s most populous eagle may be the african fish eagle haliaeetus vocifer which has a stable total population estimated at 300 000 and is found solely in africa 5 120 on a global scale the golden eagle is not considered threatened by the iucn 2 references aquila chrysaetos linnaeus 1758 golden eagle pbdb

rampaged through space sector 666 atros was one of only five beings in the entire sector to escape death having been forced to witness his own wife and daughters killed by one of the rampaging robots 2 renaming himself atrocitus he and the other four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as the five inversions bent on the destruction of the guardians of the universe and all who served them with atrocitus serving as their leader 3 the five inversions performed a ritual which allowed them to peer into the future and discover the prophecy of the blackest night which decreed that all life in the universe would end forming an empire of tears the inversions attempted to destroy the guardians but were defeated and imprisoned on the planet ysmault 4 some time later abin sur began making periodic visits to ysmault and began to ask questions regarding the blackest night 5 sur even went so far as to free atrocitus from his imprisonment so that he could lead the green lantern to earth the prophesied birthplace of the black that would one day end the universe taken to earth by starship due to fellow inversion qull predicting that sur s ring would one day fail him when he most needed it and bound by energy restraints created by sur s ring atrocitus instilled fear in his captor allowing the yellow impurity to seep into his willpower constructs and weaken them enough to allow him to break free after slashing the green lantern in the chest mortally wounding him atrocitus jumped from a point high in earth s atmosphere to escape sur s failing ship 6 encounter with william hand edit after landing near an airbase and killing an unspecified number of air force troopers atrocitus recited what would later become the oath of the red lantern corps and performed a ritual that told him the name of the herald of the blackest night william hand 7 atrocitus created a device using stolen gun parts that acted as a cosmic divining rod and used it to lead him to hand once he tracked down the human who it was said would play a prominent role in the coming of the blackest night he attacked and planned to take hand s innards back to ysmault before his plan proceeded however sinestro and rookie green lantern hal jordan intercepted him spiriting william hand to safety atrocitus used his newly constructed device to sap the power from their rings leaving them with only their wits to defend them from the master of the five inversions 4 sinestro was able to restore their rings powers through his power battery but atrocitus still had the upper hand just as he was about to crush sinestro with a power shovel jordan used his ring to blow up the yellow vehicle which surprised atrocitus greatly as he believed green lantern rings did not work on anything colored yellow defeated atrocitus was contained by sinestro and brought to oa 8 he was later returned to ysmault by sinestro where he prophesied that sinestro s home planet korugar would soon erupt into chaos and disorder 9 through this act it was implied that it was atrocitus who planted the seeds of sinestro s later fall from grace rage of the red lanterns edit see also final crisis in the aftermath of the sinestro corps war atrocitus was seen forging a red lantern power battery utilizing the power of rage he said that his first new victim would be the one who called himself the greatest green lantern sinestro who had long since abandoned the green lantern corps to forge a corps in his own namesake he also murdered qull of the five inversions a fellow member of the empire of tears and the one responsible for telling abin sur the prophecy of the blackest night which caused the guardians of the universe to continue the empire of tears incarceration on ysmault rather than transfer them to oa s sciencells closer to the enemies of the five inversions by bludgeoning him with the power battery in this way the first power battery was christened with blood 10 atrocitus murdered the other members of the five inversions using their blood to create red power rings power batteries and a red central power battery on ysmault atrocitus soon donned his new red power ring becoming the first red lantern he recruited many other individuals from across the universe who possessed great anger and hate including former green lantern laira many of them had been wronged by the sinestro corps and atrocitus promises them that the red lantern corps will eradicate sinestro himself he led his new corps in an assault against sinestro while he was being transferred by some members of the green lantern corps from the oan sciencells to his home planet of korugar for execution the red lanterns interrupted a deadly fight between sinestro s forces and the green lanterns killing members of both sides without discrimination atrocitus personally slew the long standing green lantern remnant nod eventually sinestro was captured and taken to ysmault for execution and hal jordan who had faced atrocitus before was left for dead in space 11 after bringing sinestro to ysmault atrocitus nailed the former green lantern to a cross to await his execution at his own hands however unlike the guardians who preferred a quick execution atrocitus wished to make sinestro suffer first by taking revenge on everything he has ever cared about his targets included korugar and sinestro s previously unknown and hidden daughter whose identity atrocitus had learned through his blood prophecies 12 when hal jordan and the blue lanterns arrived to recover sinestro atrocitus revealed another prophecy to jordan that the guardians will one day take his greatest love and he will become a renegade once again because of their actions although sinestro believes that atrocitus prophecy could be a form of reverse psychology

save jordan in a burst of outrage jordan prepared to carry out sinestro s death sentence himself against the wishes of the blue lanterns the rage that jordan felt drew laira s red ring to him converting jordan into the newest member of the red lantern corps 13 jordan attacked the blue lanterns and sinestro until saint walker managed to get a blue power ring onto his finger the blue ring negated the effects of the red ring restoring jordan to normal jordan then attacked atrocitus using the power of the blue and green rings to make the red one explode in his face defeated the red

power rings descended onto ysmault reanimating the bodies of laira and atrocitus fellow inversions 15 the reanimated qull ripped out atrocitus heart however because red lantern rings effectively

guy 23 sometime later he appeared in new york city with the feline red lantern corps member dex starr in search of the emotional spectrum entities they killed several criminals in the subway while sparing the remaining riders in the subway car when he performed his blood ritual it revealed to him the location of the entities except for ion and parallax hal carol and sinestro confronted atrocitus for his murderous actions as he finished the ritual however atrocitus justified them by claiming they did what they did to protect innocents carol confirmed atrocitus sincerity by detecting a spark of love in his heart with her powers that was not there during their previous encounter only to have her words ignite his anger enraged atrocitus blasts the trio out of the subway and engages in combat during the brawl it is revealed that atrocitus has learned how to create constructs with his powers their fight is then interrupted as lobo makes an appearance incapacitating hal 24 the lanterns join together to fight off lobo with atrocitus revealing that he is on earth to stop the being who is capturing the emotional entities it is later revealed that atrocitus had hired lobo to attack him in order to gain the others trust 25 during his search for the rage entity known as the butcher atrocitus incinerates a prison bus full of murderers claiming that those who take life do not deserve it 26 atrocitus locates the butcher who is about to possess a man whose daughter had been killed by a death row inmate despite the spectre s attempts to stop it the butcher succeeds killing the criminal the butcher then attempts to possess atrocitus revealing that atrocitus had a wife and children who were killed in the manhunters attack with the spectre s help atrocitus wards off the butcher and imprisons it within his power battery the spectre attempts to judge the man that the butcher possessed but atrocitus argues that his method of judgment is flawed the spectre calls off his judgment and is unable to judge atrocitus discovering that his mission is a holy one 27 he returns to jordan and the other new guardians hal jordan carol ferris sinestro larfleeze agent orange saint walker indigo 1 and himself just as a robed figure gained the upper hand in their fight catching him off guard with a burst of his napalm acidic blood atrocitus vented his long suppressed rage against the guardians upon krona knowing of his maltus origins and how he was once connected to the guardians of the universe without the rage entity to control atrocitus powers krona fell victim to his attack as the red lantern viciously bites him in the jugular using the ion entity to counterattack krona used ophidian to disrupt the new guardians from fighting back including atrocitus learning that atrocitus had trapped the butcher inside of his lantern krona exorcized the rage entity from its prison and made him his own atrocitus and the new guardians were utterly defeated and once again stuck together to find krona using larfleeze to track down the avarice entity 28 war of the green lanterns edit atrocitus and the rest of the new guardians make their way to ryut where larfleeze has detected ophidian krona and the entities are nowhere to be found but the group does come upon the book of the black inside they discover that it was krona who purposefully reprogrammed the manhunters to wipe out all life in sector 666 29 atrocitus reveals that he already knew this former sinestro corps member lyssa drak appears and quickly subdues the new guardians trapping all but hal in the book of the black 30 when hal meets up with guy gardner at the green house guy reveals the pact made between him ganthet and atrocitus it is revealed that part of the pact was that once krona had been defeated he would be turned over to atrocitus to face justice hal told guy that this most likely means executing krona 31 in the final battle atrocitus is freed from the book by kyle rayner and his red ring returns to him although outraged at losing the chance to kill krona due to hal jordan atrocitus is unable to vent his fury as the guardians of the universe teleport him back home 32 afterwards atrocitus was confronted by ganthet who brings krona s corpse to him to do what he wishes 33 red lanterns edit following his return to ysmault atrocitus feels his rage dimming and fears that he may lose control over the red lantern hordes using krona s innards to perform a blood ritual atrocitus sees many acts of evil across the universe he resolves to lead his red lanterns in punishing the guilty 2 however feeling his control over the rampaging animalistic red lanterns dimming he also decides to uplift one of them to be his equal and helper 34 he settles for bleez restoring her mind and naming her his new right hand 35 it is later revealed that he has kept krona s corpse as a confidant talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the red lantern corps and his plans to upgrade their intelligence however after granting intellects to three additional red lanterns to act as a check to bleez atrocitus returns to the place where he has left krona s body only to find it gone 36 although atrocitus attempts to find krona s body he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that krona has come back to life 37 and when faced with a revolt from bleez atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of krona s body has robbed him of the focus of his rage as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he used to consider his mere identity enough of a justification 38 he briefly regains his focus and unbridled rage when he discovers how krona did not resurrect instead abysmus one of his early experiments at creating life by the use of necromancy and shamanic rituals had stolen krona s body eaten and flayed him and used his skin to empower himself and similar demonic creatures known as the abysmorphs abysmus and the abysmorphs manage to overpower atrocitus wounding him grievously causing atrocitus to summon john moore the new backup red lantern of the sector 2814 39 learning that kyle is attempting to acquire the power of the seven corps atrocitus agrees to train kyle to harness the red ring of rage to use that power against the guardians he attempts to provoke kyle s rage by reminding him of the death of his girlfriend alex after he got the ring but when this fails kyle instead feels grief rather than anger he takes kyle to witness a group of people being threatened and executed in another country kyle s anger at this provoking the activation of the red power within him 40 during a confrontation with the first lantern atrocitus is shown a world where the massacre of sector 666 never took place but witnesses a life where he became a brutal dictator after overthrowing his world s government even killing his wife before he is finally killed by his own son horrified at this vision atroctius rejects the first lantern s offer to make that world the reality believing that even the loss of his entire sector is better than being killed by his own son although he briefly orders the other red lanterns to kill him as he blames himself for the massacre 41 atrocitus later decides to use this experience to reconnect with the rage that drives his corps and leads them in the final assault against the first lantern 42 which culminates in him killing one of the last guardians of the universe 43 after a parallax possessed sinestro kills the others 44 in the aftermath of wrath of the first lantern atrocitus loses his ring to guy gardner who has been recruited by hal jordan as a mole and has his severely beaten body to be carried away by dex starr 45 after drifting in space for a while he manages to merge with the butcher the red light living embodiment of rage 46 which he then loses to kyle rayner during the fight against relic 47 atrocitus and dex starr then find another feral red lantern 48 kill it and take its ring 49 he then captures rankorr 50 and forces a bug inside him to make him feral he then poisons the blood on ysmult 51 and using a second lake on styge prime he creates hundreds of rings and sends them to earth 52 he then uses these new formed reds from earth to fight guy gardner 53 but gardner bears him by proving his rage greater than atrocitus and takes away his ring along with dex starr s and all the new formed red s as well although it is presumed he is dead gardner still refers to him as alive 54 dc rebirth edit in dc rebirth atrocitus resumes his reign over the red lanterns he begins by enacting the prophecy of the red dawn on earth to do this he began infecting humanity with rage and constructed a hell tower 55 powers and abilities edit atrocitus wields a red lantern power ring similar to that of a green lantern s except it is powered by rage rather than willpower the full extent of a red power ring s powers has not been revealed but it is stated in final crisis rage of the red lanterns that the red ring acts as their heart and pumps their rage tainted blood out of their body through their mouth while initially unable to do so atrocitus learned to create red light constructs after observing the other lanterns during the blackest night it is also shown 12 that the ring s red energy corrupts the auras of other power rings and burns them away possibly corrupting the ring beyond the ability of a lantern to use unlike the other members of the red lantern corps whose rings reduce them to being mindless raging beasts leaving them unable to create and maintain energy constructs as do green and blue lanterns atrocitus is in full control of his mental faculties while wearing his ring and may not be affected in the same manner however the red lantern s corruptive energy can be overcome and purified by the blue lantern s energies 11 atrocitus can deliberately override the corruptive influence of the red energy on his followers by using his magic but never chooses to do so 35 atrocitus possesses superhuman strength and durability strong enough to toss a 14 ton construction digger and durable enough to withstand knife attacks 56 atrocitus association with the empire of tears granted him a great deal of shamanistic magic which he used to forge the red lantern rings and divine the location of william hand 7 atrocitus is highly intelligent able to construct the energy draining device later used by black hand from simple gun and computer parts 4 before the manhunters destroyed sector 666 atrocitus was a

calcium magnesium ferroactinolite calcium magnesium iron the middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos

b treatment involves exposing a promising but stained piece of jadeite to chemical bleaches and or acids and impregnating it with a clear polymer resin this results in a significant improvement of transparency and colour of the material currently infrared spectroscopy is the most accurate test for the detection of polymer in jadeite type c jade has been artificially stained or dyed the effects

lizarkon a humanoid lizard belonging to one of the many different species who inhabit thanagar and a veteran soldier of the rann thanagar war as member of the imperial thanagarian army kol was scheduled to be executed for killing his commanding officer because his superior wanted to surrender to a squadron of rannians kol explains to a fellow prisoner that he hates cowards and that after killing his superior he and the rest of his squad defeated the rannians and that his fellow soldiers attempted to report the superior s death as an accident but kol who personally held truth as a guiding principle refused to lie 1 at the exact moment before he was to be executed however he is saved by a green lantern power ring the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the green lantern corps 1 the corps was in the process of recruiting 7 200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain parallax the rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer and thus the ring which includes a sentient computer frees kol from his bonds and allows

threatening an okaaran hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star the star eventually went supernova and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship

it is a silvery grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table a uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons of which 6 are valence electrons uranium is weakly radioactive because all isotopes of uranium are unstable the half lives of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159 200 years and 4 5 billion years the most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium 238 which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 of uranium on earth and uranium 235 which has 143 neutrons uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements its density is about 70 higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten it occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil rock and water and is commercially extracted from uranium bearing minerals such as uraninite 4 in nature uranium is found as uranium 238 99 2739 99 2752 uranium 235 0 7198 0 7202 and a very small amount of uranium 234 0 0050 0 0059 5 uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle the half life of uranium 238 is about 4 47 billion years and that of uranium 235 is 704 million years 6 making them useful in dating the age of the earth many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties uranium 235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons however because of the tiny amounts found in nature uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium 235 is present uranium 238 is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium 239 in a nuclear reactor another fissile isotope uranium 233 can be produced from natural thorium and is studied for future industrial use in nuclear technology citation needed uranium 238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons uranium 235 and to a lesser degree uranium 233 have a much higher fission cross section for slow neutrons in sufficient concentration these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction this generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons depleted uranium 238u is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating 7 uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing lemon yellow to green colors uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography the 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth who named the new element after the recently discovered planet uranus eugène melchior péligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by henri becquerel research by otto hahn lise meitner enrico fermi and others such as j robert oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in little boy the first nuclear weapon used in war an ensuing arms race during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium derived plutonium 239 the security of those weapons is closely monitored since around 2000 plutonium obtained by dismantling cold war era bombs is used as fuel for nuclear reactors the

external links characteristics a neutron induced nuclear fission event involving uranium 235 when refined uranium is a silvery white weakly radioactive metal it has a mohs hardness of 6 sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium rhodium manganese and niobium it is malleable ductile slightly paramagnetic strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor 8 9 uranium metal has a very high density of 19 1 g cm3 10 denser than lead 11 3 g cm3 11 but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold 19 3 g cm3 12 13 uranium metal reacts with almost all non metal elements with the exception of the noble gases and their compounds with reactivity increasing with temperature 14 hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium but non oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly 8 when finely divided it can react with cold water in air uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide 9 uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry uranium 235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable but not fissile on bombardment with slow neutrons its uranium 235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium 235 nuclei a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or in special circumstances an explosion in a nuclear reactor such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison absorbing some of the free neutrons such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control as little as 15 lb 6 8 kg of uranium 235 can be used to make an atomic bomb 15 the nuclear weapon detonated over hiroshima called little boy relied on uranium fission however the first nuclear bomb the gadget used at trinity and the bomb that was detonated over nagasaki fat man were both plutonium bombs uranium metal has three allotropic forms 16 α

penetrators this ammunition consists of depleted uranium du alloyed with 1 2 other elements such as titanium or molybdenum 18 at high impact speed the density hardness and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates the use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the us uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil see gulf war syndrome 15 depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials while the metal itself is radioactive its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium 8 other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces as ballast for missile re entry vehicles and as a shielding material 9 due to its high density this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses 9 depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost 19 the main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak alpha emitter during the later stages of world war ii the entire cold war and to a lesser extent afterwards uranium 235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons initially two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses uranium 235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium 239 derived from uranium 238 later a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission fusion bomb thermonuclear weapon was built that uses a plutonium based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion such bombs are jacketed in a non fissile unenriched uranium case and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process 20 civilian the most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in nuclear power plants the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants one kilogram of uranium 235 can theoretically produce about 20 terajoules of energy 2 1013 joules assuming complete fission as much energy as 1 5 million kilograms 1 500 tonnes of coal 7 commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3 uranium 235 7 the candu and magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel fuel used for united states navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium 235 the exact values are classified in a breeder reactor uranium 238 can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction 9 23892u n 23992u γ β 23993np β 23994pu uranium glass glowing under uv light before and occasionally after the discovery of radioactivity uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes such as uranium glass and in fiestaware 21 the discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore pitchblende by marie curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium which was used to make glow in the dark paints for clock and aircraft dials 22 23 this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant besides the pottery glazes uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green yellow mauve black blue red and other colors the uranium glaze on a sencer sarı ceramic glowing under uv light uranium glass used as lead in seals in a vacuum capacitor uranium was also used in photographic chemicals especially uranium nitrate as a toner 9 in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs 24 to improve the appearance of dentures 25 and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron dense stains in transmission electron microscopy to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses isolated cell organelles and macromolecules the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element the long half life of the isotope uranium 238 4 47 109 years makes it well suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating including uranium thorium dating uranium lead dating and uranium uranium dating uranium metal is used for x ray targets in the making of high energy x rays 9 history pre discovery use the planet uranus which uranium is named after the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 ce when it was used in the roman empire to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes 9 yellow glass with 1 uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples italy by r t gunther of the university of oxford in 1912 26 starting in the late middle ages pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal bohemia now jáchymov in the czech republic and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry 27 in the early 19th century the world s only known sources of uranium ore were these mines mining for uranium in the ore mountains ceased on the german side after the cold war ended and sdag wismut was wound down on the czech side there were attempts during the uranium price bubble of 2007 to restart mining but those were quickly abandoned following a fall in uranium prices 28 29 discovery antoine henri becquerel discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity by exposing a photographic plate to uranium in 1896 the discovery of the element is credited to the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth while he was working in his experimental laboratory in berlin in 1789 klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely sodium diuranate by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide 27 klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself in fact that powder was an oxide of uranium 27 30 he named the newly discovered element after the planet uranus named after the primordial greek god of the sky which had been discovered eight years earlier by william herschel 31 in 1841 eugène melchior péligot professor of analytical chemistry at the conservatoire national des arts et métiers central school of arts and manufactures in paris isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium 27 32 henri becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896 14 becquerel made the discovery in paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt k2uo2 so4 2 potassium uranyl sulfate on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become fogged 33 he determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate during world war i when the central powers suffered a shortage of molybdenum to make artillery gun barrels and high speed tool steels they routinely substituted ferrouranium alloys which present many of the same physical characteristics when this practice became known in 1916 the usa government requested several prominent universities to research these uses for uranium and tools made with these formulas remained in use for several decades only ending when the manhattan project and the cold war placed a large demand on uranium for fission research and weapon development 34 35 36 fission research cubes and cuboids of uranium produced during the manhattan project a team led by enrico fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays electrons or positrons from the elements produced see beta particle 37 the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94 which the dean of the faculty of rome orso mario corbino christened ausonium and hesperium respectively 38 39 40 41 the experiments leading to the discovery of uranium s ability to fission break apart into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann 37 in hahn s laboratory in berlin lise meitner and her nephew the physicist otto robert frisch published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process nuclear fission 42 soon after fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 and later work found that on average about 2 5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium 235 37 fermi urged alfred o c nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component and on 29 february 1940 nier used an instrument he built at the university of minnesota to separate the world s first uranium 235 sample in the tate laboratory after mailed to columbia university s cyclotron john dunning confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on 1 march 43 further work found that the far more common uranium 238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium which like uranium 235 is also fissile by thermal neutrons these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power despite fission having been discovered in germany the uranverein uranium club germany s wartime project to research nuclear power and or weapons was hampered by limited resources infighting the exile or non involvement of several prominent scientists in the field and several crucial mistakes such as failing to account for impurities in available graphite samples which made it appear less suitable as a neutron moderator than it is in reality germany s attempts to build a natural uranium heavy water reactor had not come close to reaching criticality by the time the americans reached haigerloch the site of the last german wartime reactor experiment 44 on 2 december 1942 as part of the manhattan project another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self sustained nuclear chain reaction chicago pile 1 an initial plan using enriched uranium 235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities 45 working in a lab below the stands of stagg field at the university of chicago the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400 short tons 360 metric tons of graphite 58 short tons 53 metric tons of uranium oxide and six short tons 5 5 metric tons of uranium metal a majority of which was supplied by westinghouse lamp plant in a makeshift production process 37 46 nuclear weaponry the mushroom cloud over hiroshima after the dropping of the uranium based atomic bomb nicknamed little boy two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the united states during world war ii a uranium based device codenamed little boy whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium and a plutonium based device see trinity test and fat man whose plutonium was derived from uranium 238 the uranium based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945 exploding with a yield equivalent to 12 500 tonnes of tnt the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50 000 buildings and killed approximately 75 000 people see atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki 33 initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world 47 reactors four light bulbs lit with electricity generated from the first artificial electricity producing nuclear reactor ebr i 1951 the x 10 graphite reactor at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee formerly known as the clinton pile and x 10 pile was the world s second artificial nuclear reactor after enrico fermi s chicago pile and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation argonne national laboratory s experimental breeder reactor i located at the atomic energy commission s national reactor testing station near arco idaho became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 december 1951 48 initially four 150 watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility later the town of arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by borax iii another reactor designed and operated by argonne national laboratory 49 50 the world s first commercial scale nuclear power station obninsk in the soviet union began generation with its reactor am 1 on 27 june 1954 other early nuclear power plants were calder hall in england which began generation on 17 october 1956 51 and the shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania which began on 26 may 1958 nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine the uss nautilus in 1954 37 52 prehistoric naturally occurring fission main article natural nuclear fission reactor in 1972 the french physicist francis perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the oklo mine in gabon west africa collectively known as the oklo fossil reactors the ore deposit is 1 7 billion years old then uranium 235 constituted about 3 of the total uranium on earth 53 this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur provided other supporting conditions exist the capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the u s federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository 53 contamination and the cold war legacy this

nuclear tests by the soviet union and the united states in the 1950s and early 1960s and by france into the 1970s and 1980s 19 spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world 54 additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents 55 uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer an excess risk of lung cancer among navajo uranium miners for example has been documented and linked to their occupation 56 the radiation exposure compensation act a 1990 law in the us required 100 000 in compassion payments to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments 57 during the cold war between the soviet union and the united states huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium since the break up of the soviet union in 1991 an estimated 600 short tons 540 metric tons of highly enriched weapons grade uranium enough to make 40 000 nuclear warheads have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the russian federation and several other former soviet states 15 police in asia europe and south america on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb grade uranium or plutonium most of which was from ex soviet sources 15 from 1993 to 2005 the material protection control and accounting program operated by the federal government of the united states spent approximately us 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in russia 15 this money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities scientific american reported in february 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair according to an interview from the article one facility had been storing samples of enriched weapons grade uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box 58 occurrence origin along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron uranium is only naturally formed by the r process rapid neutron capture in supernovae and neutron star mergers 59 primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r process because the s process slow neutron capture is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth 60 61 besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes 235u and 238u the r process also produced significant quantities of 236u which has a shorter half life and so is an extinct radionuclide having long since decayed completely to 232th uranium 236 was itself enriched by the decay of 244pu accounting for the observed higher than expected abundance of thorium and lower than expected abundance of uranium 62 while the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242pu half life 0 375 million years and 247cm half life 16 million years producing 238u and 235u respectively this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half

red and from 238u in green uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the earth s crust uranium is also the highest numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is almost always found combined with other elements 9 the decay of uranium thorium and potassium 40 in the earth s mantle is thought to be the main source of heat 64 65 that keeps the earth s outer core in the liquid state and drives mantle convection which in turn drives plate tectonics uranium s average concentration in the earth s crust is depending on the reference 2 to 4 parts per million 8 19 or about 40 times as abundant as silver 14 the earth s crust from the surface to 25 km 15 mi down is calculated to contain 1017 kg 2 1017 lb of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013 kg 2 1013 lb 8 the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0 7 to 11 parts per million up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion 19 uranium is more plentiful than antimony tin cadmium mercury or silver and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum 9 19 uranium is found in hundreds of minerals including uraninite the most common uranium ore carnotite autunite uranophane torbernite and coffinite 9 significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits and minerals such as lignite and monazite sands in uranium rich ores 9 it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0 1 uranium 14 citrobacter species can have concentrations of uranium in their cells 300 times the level of the surrounding environment some bacteria such as shewanella putrefaciens geobacter metallireducens and some strains of burkholderia fungorum use uranium for their growth and convert u vi to u iv 66 67 recent research suggests that this pathway includes reduction of the soluble u vi via an intermediate u v pentavalent state 68 69 other organisms such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment 70 citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium polluted water 27 71 the proteobacterium geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water 72 the mycorrhizal fungus glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant 73 in nature uranium vi forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline ph this leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards however it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline ph a sphingomonas sp strain bsar 1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase phok that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions the precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing phok protein in e coli 74 plants absorb some uranium from soil dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million 27 dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat 27 production and mining main article uranium mining uranium production 2015 in tonnes 75 worldwide production of u3o8 yellowcake in 2013 amounted to 70 015 tonnes of which 22 451 t 32 was mined in kazakhstan other important uranium mining countries are canada 9 331 t australia 6 350 t niger 4 518 t namibia 4 323 t and russia 3 135 t 76 uranium ore is mined in several ways by open pit underground in situ leaching and borehole mining see uranium mining 7 low grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0 01 to 0 25 uranium oxides extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore 77 high grade ores found in athabasca basin deposits in saskatchewan canada can contain up to 23 uranium oxides on average 78 uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali the leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange the resulting mixture called yellowcake contains at least 75 uranium oxides u3o8 yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion 79 commercial grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals 9 uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of kuf5 or uf4 dissolved in molten calcium chloride cacl2 and sodium chloride nacl solution 9 very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament 9 world uranium production mines and demand 76 yellowcake is a concentrated mixture of uranium oxides that is further refined to extract pure uranium resources and reserves uranium prices it is estimated that 5 5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at us 59 per lb of uranium 80 while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction 81 prices went from about 10 lb in may 2003 to 138 lb in july 2007 this has caused a big increase in spending on exploration 80 with us 200 million being spent worldwide in 2005 a 54 increase on the previous year 81 this trend continued through 2006 when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over 774 million an increase of over 250 compared to 2004 the oecd nuclear energy agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006 80 australia has 31 of the world s known uranium ore reserves 82 and the world s largest single uranium deposit located at the olympic dam mine in south australia 83 there is a significant reserve of uranium in bakouma a sub prefecture in the prefecture of mbomou in the central african republic 84 some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled 85 such as from the megatons to megawatts program an additional 4 6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be dissolved in sea water japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible 86 87 there have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water 88 but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water in 2012 ornl researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed hicap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water according to results verified by researchers at pacific northwest national laboratory 89 90 supplies this section needs to be updated please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information september 2016 main article uranium market see also 2000s commodities boom monthly uranium spot price in us per pound the 2007 price peak is clearly visible 91 in 2005 seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides canada 27 9 of world production australia 22 8 kazakhstan 10 5 russia 8 0 namibia 7 5 niger 7 4 uzbekistan 5 5 the united states 2 5 argentina 2 1 ukraine 1 9 and china 1 7 92 in 2008 kazakhstan was forecast to increase production and may have become the world s largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12 826 tonnes compared to canada with 11 100 t and australia with 9 430 t 93 94 the predictions have come true in 2019 kazakhstan produces the largest share of uranium from mines 42 of world supply followed by canada 13 and australia 12 namibia 10 uzbekistan 6 niger 5 russia 5 china 3 ukraine 1 5 usa 0 12 india 0 6 iran 0 13 with total world production 54752 tonnes from mines 95 however it should be mentioned that in 2019 uranium was mined not only by conventional underground mining of ores 43 of production 54752 tonnes where rock mineralised is removed from the ground breaking it up and treating it to remove the minerals being sought but also by in situ leaching methods isl 57 of world production 64 566 tonnes 96 95 in the late 1960s un geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in somalia the find was the largest of its kind with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25 of the world s then known uranium reserves of 800 000 tons 97 the ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years 81 although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century 98 uranium deposits seem to be log normal distributed there is a 300 fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade 99 in other words there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available compounds reactions of uranium metal oxidation states and oxides oxides triuranium octoxide left and uranium dioxide right are the two most common uranium oxides calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber uranium content is usually referenced to u3o8 which dates to the days of the manhattan project when u3o8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard 100 phase relationships in the uranium oxygen system are complex the most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium iv and uranium vi and their two corresponding oxides are respectively uranium dioxide uo2 and uranium trioxide uo3 101 other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide uo diuranium pentoxide u2o5 and uranium peroxide uo4 2h2o also exist the most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide u3o8 and uo2 102 both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions triuranium octoxide is depending on conditions the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel 102 at ambient temperatures uo2 will gradually convert to u3o8 because of their stability uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal 102 aqueous chemistry uranium in its oxidation states iii iv v vi salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions the most common ionic forms are u3 brown red u4 green uo 2 unstable and uo2 2 yellow for u iii u iv u v and u vi respectively 103 a few solid and semi metallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ii but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state ions of u3 liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable the uo2 2 ion represents the uranium vi state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate uo2 2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate 103 unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium oxide cationic forms the uranates salts containing a polyatomic uranium oxide anion are generally not water soluble carbonates the interactions of carbonate anions with uranium vi cause the pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water uranium carbonates are often soluble in water this is because a u vi cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes pourbaix diagrams 104 uranium in a non complexing aqueous medium e g perchloric acid sodium hydroxide 104 uranium in carbonate solution relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in a non complexing aqueous medium e g perchloric acid sodium hydroxide 104 relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in an aqueous carbonate solution 104 effects of ph the uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further when the ph of a uranium vi solution increases the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high phs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex when carbonate is added uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the ph is increased one effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the ph range 6 to 8 a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels hydrides carbides and nitrides uranium metal heated to 250 to 300 c 482 to 572 f reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide nitride and halide compounds 105 two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250 c 105 uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids react with water and can ignite in air to form u3o8 105 carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide uc uranium dicarbide uc2 and diuranium tricarbide u2c3 both uc and uc2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures stable below 1800 c u2c3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of uc and uc2 to mechanical stress 106 uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride un uranium dinitride un2 and diuranium trinitride u2n3 106 halides uranium hexafluoride is the feedstock used to separate uranium 235 from natural uranium all uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride uf4 uf4 itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide 105 reduction of uf4 with hydrogen at 1000 c produces uranium trifluoride uf3 under the right conditions of temperature and pressure the reaction of solid uf4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf6 can form the intermediate fluorides of u2f9 u4f17 and uf5 105 at room temperatures uf6 has a high vapor pressure making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium 235 from the common uranium 238 isotope this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process 105 uo2 4 hf uf4 2 h2o 500 c endothermic uf4 f2 uf6 350 c endothermic the resulting uf6 a white solid is highly reactive by fluorination easily sublimes emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist 105 one method of preparing uranium tetrachloride ucl4 is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride the reduction of ucl4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ucl3 while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine 105 all uranium chlorides react with water and air bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of respectively bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding uh3 to those element s acids 105 known examples include ubr3 ubr4 ui3 and ui4 ui5 has never been prepared uranium oxyhalides are water soluble and include uo2f2 uocl2 uo2cl2 and uo2br2 stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the atomic weight of the component halide increases 105 isotopes natural concentrations main article isotopes of uranium natural uranium consists of three major isotopes uranium 238 99 28 natural abundance uranium 235 0 71 and uranium 234 0 0054 all three are radioactive emitting alpha particles with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission there are also four other trace isotopes uranium 239 which is formed when 238u undergoes spontaneous fission releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238u atom uranium 237 which is formed when 238u captures a neutron but emits two more which then decays to neptunium 237 uranium 236 which occurs in trace quantities due to neutron capture on 235u and as a decay product of plutonium 244 109 and finally uranium 233 which is formed in the decay chain of neptunium 237 it is also expected that thorium 232 should be able to undergo double beta decay which would produce uranium 232 but this has not yet been observed experimentally 110 the only significant deviation from the u 235 to u 238 ratio in any known natural samples occurs in oklo gabon where natural nuclear fission reactors consumed some of the u 235 some two billion years ago when the ratio of u 235 to u 238 was more akin to that of low enriched uranium allowing regular light water to act as a neutron moderator akin to the process in humanmade light water reactors the existence of such natural fission reactors which had been theoretically predicted beforehand was proven as the slight deviation of u 235 concentration from the expected values were discovered during uranium enrichment in france subsequent investigations to rule out any nefarious human action such as stealing of u 235 confirmed the theory by finding isotope ratios of common fission products or rather their stable daughter nuclides in line with the values expected for fission but deviating from the values expected for non fission derived samples of those elements uranium 238 is the most stable isotope of uranium with a half life of about 4 468 109 years roughly the age of the earth uranium 235 has a half life of about 7 13 108 years and uranium 234 has a half life of about 2 48 105 years 111 uranium 238 is usually an alpha emitter occasionally it undergoes spontaneous fission decaying through the uranium series which has 18 members into lead 206 by a variety of different decay paths 14 the decay chain of 235u which is called the actinium series has 15 members and eventually decays into lead 207 14 the constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating uranium 234 which is a member of the uranium series the decay chain of uranium 238 decays to lead 206 through a series of relatively short lived isotopes uranium 233 is made from thorium 232 by neutron bombardment usually in a nuclear reactor and 233u is also fissile 9 its decay chain forms part of the neptunium series and ends at bismuth 209 and thallium 205 uranium 235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is fissile this means that it can be split into two or three fragments fission products by thermal neutrons 14 uranium 238 is not fissile but is a fertile isotope because after neutron activation it can be converted to plutonium 239 another fissile isotope indeed the 238u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium 239 239u decays by beta emission to neptunium 239 also a beta emitter that decays in its turn within a few days into plutonium 239 239pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the trinity test on 15 july 1945 in new mexico 37 enrichment main article enriched uranium cascades of gas centrifuges are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes in nature uranium is found as uranium 238 99 2742 and uranium 235 0 7204 isotope separation concentrates enriches the fissionable uranium 235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium 235 must impact other uranium 235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction the concentration and amount of uranium 235 needed to achieve this is called a critical mass to be considered enriched the uranium 235 fraction should be between 3 and 5 112 this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium 235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium 238 called depleted uranium or du to be considered depleted the uranium 235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0 3 113 the price of uranium has risen since 2001 so enrichment tailings containing more than 0 35 uranium 235 are being considered for re enrichment driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from 5 in 2001 113 the gas centrifuge process where gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf6 is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using high speed centrifuges is the cheapest and leading enrichment process 33 the gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the manhattan project in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver zinc membrane and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium 235 33 the molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium 235 and fluorine this leaves uranium 238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium 235 metal to precipitate from the solution 7 an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation avlis and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers 114 another method used is liquid thermal diffusion 8 human exposure a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as radon by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food the amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used or live or work near a coal fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium 115 116 houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or man made slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0 25 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 0 2 mg m3 over an 8 hour workday and a short term limit of 0 6 mg m3 at levels of 10 mg m3 uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health 117 most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion only 0 5 is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5 27 however soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body whereas insoluble uranium compounds especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs pose a more serious exposure hazard after entering the bloodstream the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium s affinity for phosphates 27 uranium is not absorbed through the skin and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions which accumulate in bone liver kidney and reproductive tissues uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces 118 and aquifers 119 effects and precautions normal functioning of the kidney brain liver heart and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because besides being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal 27 120 121 uranium is also a reproductive toxicant 122 123 radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation the primary form of 238u decay has a very short range and will not penetrate skin alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers 124 uranyl uo2 2 ions such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals 125 while the cdc has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium 126 exposure to uranium and its decay products especially radon are widely known and significant health threats 19 exposure to strontium 90 iodine 131 and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons 127 although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself 128 finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature 9 uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution 129 uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it 129 compilation of 2004 review on uranium toxicity 120 body system human studies animal studies in

the heywood family during an interview with newsarama new series writer geoff johns announced him as a brand new character with new powers 27 he debuted in justice society of america 2 with the name of nathan buckeye heywood nathan is the grandson of henry heywood and cousin of henry heywood iii formerly a football star at the ohio state university nathan retired after shattering his kneecap and having his leg amputated due to an undiagnosed infection the incident left nathan addicted to painkillers while attending a heywood family reunion he is attacked by the fourth reich a team of metahuman neo nazis ordered by vandal savage to wipe out the bloodlines of golden age heroes the fourth reich fails to completely destroy the heywood bloodline as both nathan and a few children manage to survive both nathan s brother and mother are turned to metal statues by the villain reichsmark nathan jams his crutch into reichsmark s mouth causing him to spit liquid metal blood onto nathan hawkman takes him to dr mid nite who notes that the metal is being absorbed by nathan s skin nathan s brother and mother in their metal forms are moved to the rooftop of the jsa brownstone 28 later it is revealed that the metal has grown out from where nathan s amputated leg once was forming metallic bone muscles and flesh waking in his hospital room nathan is shown to have superhuman strength dr mid nite informs nathan that he is now a being of living steel due to an unknown reaction to reichsmark s blood however the steel tissues do not give nathan tactile response meaning he cannot feel textures or temperatures nor gauge exerted pressures and his weight has greatly increased causing his footsteps to crack the ground he is given a costume a second skin of a stainless steel alloy developed by dr mid nite and mr terrific specifically to restrict his movements and reduce his strength to a more manageable level they chose the costume s colors because of heywood s heritage he then joins the justice society to defeat the fourth reich 8 afterwards the press asks if he is the new commander steel nathan denies it saying that he is just an ordinary citizen so he is called citizen steel by power girl 29 when the third world survivor gog appears nathan is one of the jsa members who sides with him hoping that gog can restore his sense of touch the old god continually ignores his presence 30 it is later revealed that gog is rooting himself into the earth which would cause its destruction if he ever left and when the unconverted jsaers battle him they are blown away by winds created by gog nathan alone is able to withstand the winds gog offers nathan his greatest wishes fulfilled if he sides with him and worships him but nathan refuses and joins the fight against him for this act gog induces excruciating pain in nathan 31 nathan then tears off his suit and unleashes his full strength against gog actually managing to topple the giant which gives gog s former herald magog the chance to cut off his head and send him to the source wall 32 following gog s defeat nathan takes time off from the jsa to be with his family this consists of survivors of the attack on the reunion various children most of whom call him uncle nathan 33 or uncle nate 34 during the events of blackest night nathan helps fight off the hordes of black lanterns attacking manhattan he tries to help power girl during her battle with the newly reanimated kal l but is knocked aside by the hero who mockingly refers to him as a paperweight compared to him 35 following the split in the justice society nathan opted to join power girl s more youth oriented team of jsa all stars 36 powers and abilities edit originally commander steel could lift 1 000 pounds but when he appeared in the pages of the all star squadron he was attributed super human strength without an exact limit citizen steel s metallic body grants him superhuman strength and allows him to take direct blows from opponents as powerful as gog and remain standing and in turn knocking him to the ground the only one in the jsa able to do so but at the cost of reducing his sense of touch so that he cannot really feel anything he comes in contact with making it hard for him to judge how much effort he should put into doing things his alloy suit limits his strength to controllable levels but at a cost of slowing him down as well as making him so heavy that he has been shown cracking pavements just by walking upon removing his suit he is able to unleash his full strength without a speed penalty 37 other versions edit

ignition and extinguishing of a pile of wood shavings fire is the rapid oxidation of a material the fuel in the exothermic chemical process of combustion releasing heat light and various reaction products 1 a at a certain point in the combustion reaction called the ignition point flames are produced the flame is the visible portion of the fire flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide water vapor oxygen and nitrogen if hot enough the gases may become ionized to produce plasma depending on the substances alight and any impurities outside the color of the flame and the fire s intensity will be different 2 fire in its most common form can result in conflagration which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe the positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems its negative effects include hazard to life and property atmospheric pollution and water contamination 3 if fire removes protective vegetation heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water 4 also when vegetation is burned the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil this loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long term reduction in the fertility of the soil but this fecundity can potentially be recovered as molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere is fixed and converted to ammonia by natural phenomena such as lightning and by leguminous plants that are nitrogen fixing such as clover peas and green beans fire is one of the four classical elements and has been used by humans in rituals in agriculture for clearing land

tetrahedron fires start when a flammable or a combustible material in combination with a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen rich compound though non oxygen oxidizers exist is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel oxidizer mix and is able to sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction this is commonly called the fire tetrahedron fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions for example a flammable liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions some fuel oxygen mixes may require a catalyst a substance that is not consumed when added in any chemical reaction during combustion but which enables the reactants to combust more readily once ignited a chain reaction must take place whereby fires can sustain their own heat by the further release of heat energy in the process of combustion and may propagate provided there is a continuous supply of an oxidizer and fuel if the oxidizer is oxygen from the surrounding air the presence of a force of gravity or of some similar force caused by acceleration is necessary to produce convection which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire without gravity a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non oxidizing gases from the air which exclude oxygen and extinguish the fire because of this the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight 5 6 this does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than thermal convection fire can be extinguished by removing any one of the elements of the fire tetrahedron consider a natural gas flame such as from a stove top burner the fire can be extinguished by any of the following turning off the gas supply which removes the fuel source covering the flame completely which smothers the flame as the combustion both uses the available oxidizer the oxygen in the air and displaces it from the area around the flame with co2 application of water which removes heat from the fire faster than the fire can produce it similarly blowing hard on a flame will displace the heat of the currently burning gas from its fuel source to the same end or application of a retardant chemical such as halon to the flame which retards the chemical reaction itself until the rate of combustion is too slow to maintain the chain reaction in contrast fire is intensified by increasing the overall rate of combustion methods to do this include balancing the input of fuel and oxidizer to stoichiometric proportions increasing fuel and oxidizer input in this balanced mix increasing the ambient temperature so the fire s own heat is better able to sustain combustion or providing a catalyst a non reactant medium in which the fuel and oxidizer can more readily react flame main article flame see also flame test a candle s flame northwest crown fire experiment canada photo of a fire taken with a 1 4000th of a second exposure fire is affected by gravity left flame on earth right flame on the iss a flame is a mixture of reacting gases and solids emitting visible infrared and sometimes ultraviolet light the frequency spectrum of which depends on the chemical composition of the burning material and intermediate reaction products in many cases such as the burning of organic matter for example wood or the incomplete combustion of gas incandescent solid particles called soot produce the familiar red orange glow of fire this light has a continuous spectrum complete combustion of gas has a dim blue color due to the emission of single wavelength radiation from various electron transitions in the excited molecules formed in the flame usually oxygen is involved but hydrogen burning in chlorine also produces a flame producing hydrogen chloride hcl other possible combinations producing flames amongst many are fluorine and hydrogen and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide hydrogen and hydrazine udmh flames are similarly pale blue while burning boron and its compounds evaluated in mid 20th century as a high energy fuel for jet and rocket engines emits intense green flame leading to its informal nickname of green dragon the glow of a flame is complex black body radiation is emitted from soot gas and fuel particles though the soot particles are too small to behave like perfect blackbodies there is also photon emission by de excited atoms and molecules in the gases much of the radiation is emitted in the visible and infrared bands the color depends on temperature for the black body radiation and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra the dominant color in a flame changes with temperature the photo of the forest fire in canada is an excellent example of this variation near the ground where most burning is occurring the fire is white the hottest color possible for organic material in general or yellow above the yellow region the color changes to orange which is cooler then red which is cooler still above the red region combustion no longer occurs and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke the common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection as soot tends to rise to the top of a general flame as in a candle in normal gravity conditions making it yellow in micro gravity or zero gravity 7 such as an environment in outer space convection no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient although it may go out if not moved steadily as the co2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity and tends to smother the flame there are several possible explanations for this difference of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs 8 experiments by nasa reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on earth because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions 9 these discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry especially concerning fuel efficiency in combustion engines various steps are taken to eliminate a flame the method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil wood or a high energy fuel such as jet fuel typical adiabatic

upon that fire regime fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches each at a different stage of succession 11 different species of plants animals and microbes specialize in exploiting a particular stage and by creating these different types of patches fire allows a greater number of species to exist within a landscape fire science is a branch of physical science which includes fire behavior dynamics and combustion applications of fire science include fire protection fire investigation and wildfire management fossil record main article fossil record of fire the fossil record of fire first appears with the establishment of a land based flora in the middle ordovician period 470 million years ago 12 permitting the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere as never before as the new hordes of land plants pumped it out as a waste product when this concentration rose above 13 it permitted the possibility of wildfire 13 wildfire is first recorded in the late silurian fossil record 420 million years ago by fossils of charcoalified plants 14 15 apart from a controversial gap in the late devonian charcoal is present ever since 15 the level of atmospheric oxygen is closely related to the prevalence of charcoal clearly oxygen is the key factor in the abundance of wildfire 16 fire also became more abundant when grasses radiated and became the dominant component of many ecosystems around 6 to 7 million years ago 17 this kindling provided tinder which allowed for the more rapid spread of fire 16 these widespread fires may have initiated a positive feedback process whereby they produced a warmer drier climate more conducive to fire 16 human control early human control main article control of fire by early humans bushman starting a fire in namibia process of ignition of a match the ability to control fire was a dramatic change in the habits of early humans making fire to generate heat and light made it possible for people to cook food simultaneously increasing the variety and availability of nutrients and reducing disease by killing organisms in the food 18 the heat produced would also help people stay warm in cold weather enabling them to live in cooler climates fire also kept nocturnal predators at bay evidence of cooked food is found from 1 million years ago 19 although there is some evidence that fire may have been used in a controlled fashion about 1 million years ago 20 21 other sources put the date at 400 000 years ago 22 evidence becomes widespread around 50 to 100 thousand years ago suggesting regular use from this time interestingly resistance to air pollution started to evolve in human populations at a similar point in time 22 the use of fire became progressively more sophisticated as it was used to create charcoal and to control wildlife from tens of thousands of years ago 22 fire has also been used for centuries as a method of torture and execution as evidenced by death by burning as well as torture devices such as the iron boot which could be filled with water oil or even lead and then heated over an open fire to the agony of the wearer painting of the cathedral and the academy building after the great fire of turku by gustaf wilhelm finnberg 1827 by the neolithic revolution during the introduction of grain based agriculture people all over the world used fire as a tool in landscape management these fires were typically controlled burns or cool fires as opposed to uncontrolled hot fires which damage the soil hot fires destroy plants and animals and endanger communities 23 this is especially a problem in the forests of today where traditional burning is prevented in order to encourage the growth of timber crops cool fires are generally conducted in the spring and autumn they clear undergrowth burning up biomass that could trigger a hot fire should it get too dense they provide a greater variety of environments which encourages game and plant diversity for humans they make dense impassable forests traversable another human use for fire in regards to landscape management is its use to clear land for agriculture slash and burn agriculture is still common across much of tropical africa asia and south america for small farmers it is a convenient way to clear overgrown areas and release nutrients from standing vegetation back into the soil said miguel pinedo vasquez an ecologist at the earth institute s center for environmental research and conservation 24 however this useful strategy is also problematic growing population fragmentation of forests and warming climate are making the earth s surface more prone to ever larger escaped fires these harm ecosystems and human infrastructure cause health problems and send up spirals of carbon and soot that may encourage even more warming of the atmosphere and thus feed back into more fires globally today as much as 5 million square kilometres an area more than half the size of the united states burns in a given year 24 later human control there are numerous modern applications of fire in its broadest sense fire is used by nearly every human being on earth in a controlled setting every day users of internal combustion vehicles employ fire every time they drive thermal power stations provide electricity for a large percentage of humanity by igniting fuels such as coal oil or natural gas then using the resultant heat to boil water into steam which then drives turbines hamburg after four fire bombing raids in july 1943 which killed an estimated 50 000 people 25 the use of fire in warfare has a long history fire was the basis of all early thermal weapons homer detailed the use of fire by greek soldiers who hid in a wooden horse to burn troy during the trojan war later the byzantine fleet used greek fire to attack ships and men in the first world war the first modern flamethrowers were used by infantry and were successfully mounted on armoured vehicles in the second world war in the latter war incendiary bombs were used by axis and allies alike notably on tokyo rotterdam london hamburg and notoriously at dresden in the latter two cases firestorms were deliberately caused in which a ring of fire surrounding each city was drawn inward by an updraft caused by a central cluster of fires 26 the united states army air force also extensively used incendiaries against japanese targets in the latter months of the war devastating entire cities constructed primarily of wood and paper houses the use of napalm was employed in july 1944 towards the end of the second world war 27 although its use did not gain public attention until the vietnam war 27 molotov cocktails were also used productive use for energy a coal fired power station in china disability adjusted life year for

wood was a prehistoric fuel and is still viable today the use of fossil fuels such as petroleum natural gas and coal in power plants supplies the vast majority of the world s electricity today the international energy agency states that nearly 80 of the world s power came from these sources in 2002 29 the fire in a power station is used to heat water creating steam that drives turbines the turbines then spin an electric generator to produce electricity fire is also used to provide mechanical work directly in both external and internal combustion engines the unburnable solid remains of a combustible material left after a fire is called clinker if its melting point is below the flame temperature so that it fuses and then solidifies as it cools and ash if its melting point is above the flame temperature fire management deftly controlling a fire to optimize its size shape and intensity is generally called fire management and the more advanced forms of it as traditionally and sometimes still practiced by skilled cooks blacksmiths ironmasters and others are highly skilled activities they include knowledge about selecting which types of wood charcoal or mineral coal to burn how to arrange the fuel how to stoke the fire both in early phases and in maintenance phases how to modulate the amount of heat flames and smoke as suited to the desired application how best to bank a fire to be revived later how to choose design or modify woodstoves coalstoves bakery ovens and industrial furnaces and so on detailed expositions of fire management are available in various books about blacksmithing about skilled camping or military scouting and about the domestic arts in previous centuries protection and prevention main articles wildfire and fire protection wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use and prescribed or controlled burns 30 31 wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions 32 fire fighting services are provided in most developed areas to extinguish or contain uncontrolled fires trained firefighters use fire apparatus water supply resources such as water mains and fire hydrants or they might use a and b class foam depending on what is feeding the fire fire prevention is intended to reduce sources of ignition fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires 33 buildings especially schools and tall buildings often conduct fire drills to inform and prepare citizens on how to react to a building fire purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions 34 model building codes require passive fire protection and active fire protection systems to minimize damage resulting from a fire the most common form of active fire protection is fire sprinklers to maximize passive fire protection of buildings building materials and furnishings in most developed countries are tested for fire resistance combustibility and flammability upholstery carpeting and plastics used in vehicles and vessels are also tested where fire prevention and fire protection have failed to prevent damage fire insurance can mitigate the financial impact 35 this visualization shows fires

demolition different restoration methods and measures are used depending on the type of fire damage that occurred restoration after fire damage can be performed by property management teams building maintenance personnel or by the homeowners themselves however contacting a certified professional fire damage restoration specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore fire damaged property due to their training and extensive experience 36 most are usually listed under fire and water restoration and they can help speed repairs whether for individual homeowners or for the largest of institutions 37 fire and water restoration companies are regulated by the appropriate state s department of consumer affairs usually the state contractors license board in california all fire and water restoration companies must register with the california contractors state license board 38 presently the california contractors state license board has no specific classification for water and fire damage restoration hence the contractor s state license board requires both an asbestos certification asb as well as a demolition classification c 21 in order to perform fire and water

personified as a human skeleton dressed in a shroud and clutching a scythe from the cathedral of trier in trier germany the dead tending to flowers in the garden of death hugo simberg 1906 death is the irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism 1 for organisms with a brain death can also be defined as the irreversible cessation of functioning of the whole brain including brainstem and 2 3 brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death 4 the remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death death is an inevitable process that eventually occurs in almost all organisms death is generally applied to whole organisms the similar process seen in individual components of an organism such as cells or tissues is necrosis something that is not considered an organism such as a virus can be physically destroyed but is not said to die as of the early 21st century over 150 000 humans die each day with ageing being

hourglass stand for life death and time in this 17th century painting by philippe de champaigne french 16th 17th century ivory pendant monk and death recalling mortality and the certainty of death walters art museum the concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon 5 there are many scientific approaches and various interpretations of the concept additionally the advent of life sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition one of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life as a point in time death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends determining when death has occurred is difficult as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems 6 such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death this is difficult due to there being little consensus on how to define life it is possible to define life in terms of consciousness when consciousness ceases an organism can be said to have died one of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms that are alive but probably not conscious for example single celled organisms another problem is in defining consciousness which has many different definitions given by modern scientists psychologists and philosophers additionally many religious traditions including abrahamic and dharmic traditions hold that death does not or may not entail the end of consciousness in certain cultures death is more of a process than a single event it implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another 7 other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of organismic functioning and a human death which refers to irreversible loss of personhood more specifically death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning 8 as it pertains to human life death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person 8 historically attempts to define the exact moment of a human s death have been subjective or imprecise death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat cardiac arrest and of breathing but the development of cpr and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted this type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death dcdd proponents of the dcdd believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead 9 critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent it does not mean the situation is irreversible because if cpr was applied the person could be revived 9 thus the arguments for and against the dcdd boil down to a matter of defining the actual words permanent and irreversible which further complicates the challenge of defining death furthermore events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances without a functioning heart or lungs life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices organ transplants and artificial pacemakers today where a definition of the moment of death is required doctors and coroners usually turn to brain death or biological death to define a person as being dead people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases it is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness suspension of consciousness must be permanent and not transient as occurs during certain sleep stages and especially a coma in the case of sleep eegs can easily tell the difference the category of brain death is seen as problematic by some scholars for instance dr franklin miller senior faculty member at the department of bioethics national institutes of health notes by the late 1990s the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time these patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration control temperature excrete wastes heal wounds fight infections and most dramatically to gestate fetuses in the case of pregnant brain dead women 10 while brain death is viewed as problematic by some scholars there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death the reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible 11 also the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings the distinction should be made that brain death cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery 11 those people maintaining that only the neo cortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex all hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology at present in most places the more conservative definition of death irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain as opposed to just in the neo cortex has been adopted for example the uniform determination of death act in the united states in 2005 the terri schiavo case brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of american politics even by whole brain criteria the determination of brain death can be complicated eegs can detect spurious electrical impulses while certain drugs hypoglycemia hypoxia or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis because of this hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving eegs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions in the past adoption of this whole brain definition was a conclusion of the president s commission for the study of ethical problems in medicine and biomedical and behavioral research in 1980 12 they concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide a multitude of reasons were presented to support this definition including uniformity of standards in law for establishing death consumption of a family s fiscal resources for artificial life support and legal establishment for equating brain death with death in order to proceed with organ donation 13 aside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition the variability of its application in medical practice in 1995 the american academy of neurology aan established a set of criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death at that time three clinical features had to be satisfied in order to determine irreversible cessation of the total brain including coma with clear etiology cessation of breathing and lack of brainstem reflexes 14 this set of criteria was then updated again most recently in 2010 but substantial discrepancies still remain across hospitals and medical specialties 14 the problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the dead donor rule which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement or that organ procurement cannot result in death of the donor 9 a great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule advocates of the rule believe the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering against any moral or legal objection to organ procurement critics on the other hand believe that the rule does not uphold the best interests of the donors and that the rule does not effectively promote organ donation 9 signs main article stages of death signs of death or strong indications that a warm blooded animal is no longer alive are respiratory arrest no breathing cardiac arrest no pulse brain death no neuronal activity timeline of postmortem changes stages of death the stages that follow after death are pallor mortis paleness which happens in 15 120 minutes after death algor mortis the reduction in body temperature following death this is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature rigor mortis the limbs of the corpse become stiff latin rigor and difficult to move or manipulate livor mortis a settling of the blood in the lower dependent portion of the body putrefaction the beginning signs of decomposition decomposition the reduction into simpler forms of matter accompanied by a strong unpleasant odor skeletonization the end of decomposition where all soft tissues have decomposed leaving only the skeleton fossilization the natural preservation of the skeletal remains formed over a very long period legal see also legal death the death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions a death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions either by a doctor or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor s declaration of death misdiagnosed see also premature burial antoine wiertz s painting of a man buried alive there are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then coming back to life sometimes days later in their own coffin or when embalming procedures are about to begin from the mid 18th century onwards there was an upsurge in the public s fear of being mistakenly buried alive 15 and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse s mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum 16 writing in 1895 the physician j c ouseley claimed that as many as 2 700 people were buried prematurely each year in england and wales although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800 17 in cases of electric shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover allowing an apparently dead person to survive people found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room 18 this diving response in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflex 18 as medical technologies advance ideas about when death occurs may have to be re evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death as happened when cpr and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death the lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead therefore the concept of information theoretic death 19 has been suggested as a better means of defining when true death occurs though the concept has few practical applications outside the field of cryonics there have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life but with limited success 20 causes see also list of causes of death by rate and preventable causes of death the leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease the leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis heart disease and stroke cancer and other diseases related to obesity and aging by an extremely wide margin the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging 21 leading to various complications known as aging associated diseases these conditions cause loss of homeostasis leading to cardiac arrest causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues of the roughly 150 000 people who die each day across the globe about two thirds die of age related causes 21 in industrialized nations the proportion is much higher approaching 90 21 with improved medical capability dying has become a condition to be managed home deaths once commonplace are now rare in the developed world american children smoking in 1910 tobacco smoking caused an estimated 100 million deaths in the 20th century 22 in developing nations inferior sanitary conditions and lack of access to modern medical technology makes death from infectious diseases more common than in developed countries one such disease is tuberculosis a bacterial disease which killed 1 8m people in 2015 23 malaria causes about 400 900m cases of fever and 1 3m deaths annually 24 aids death toll in africa may reach 90 100m by 2025 25 26 according to jean ziegler united nations special reporter on the right to food 2000 mar 2008 mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58 of the total mortality rate in 2006 ziegler says worldwide approximately 62m people died from all causes and of those deaths more than 36m died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients 27 tobacco smoking killed 100 million people worldwide in the 20th century and could kill 1 billion people around the world in the 21st century a world health organization report warned 22 many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity the evolutionary cause of aging is at best only just beginning to be understood it has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of death 28 le suicidé by édouard manet depicts a man who has recently committed suicide via a firearm selye proposed a unified non specific approach to many causes of death he demonstrated that stress decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource adaptation energy the animal dies when this resource is exhausted 29 selye assumed that the adaptability is a finite supply presented at birth later on goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored up to a limit as a capital reserve of adaptation 30 in recent works adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the dominant path in the model of adaptation it is demonstrated that oscillations of well being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted 31 in 2012 suicide overtook car crashes for leading causes of human injury deaths in the u s followed by poisoning falls and murder 32 causes of death are different in different parts of the world in high income and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of 70 and predominantly die of chronic diseases in low income countries where less than one in five of all people reach the age of 70 and more than a third of all deaths are among children under 15 people predominantly die of infectious diseases 33 autopsy an autopsy is portrayed in the anatomy lesson of dr nicolaes tulp by rembrandt an autopsy also known as a postmortem examination or an obduction is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a person s death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present it is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death or for research purposes autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices a necropsy which is not always a medical procedure was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination in modern times this term is more commonly associated with the corpses of animals senescence main article senescence dead camelthorn tree within sossusvlei senescence refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long term loss of living capacities even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability in the united kingdom for example nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence while around the world it accounts for two thirds of 150 000 deaths that take place daily 34 full citation needed almost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging known in life sciences as senescence some organisms experience negligible senescence even exhibiting biological immortality these include the jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii 35 the hydra and the planarian unnatural causes of death include suicide and predation from all causes roughly 150 000 people die around the world each day 21 of these two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence but in industrialized countries such as the united states the united kingdom and germany the rate approaches 90 i e nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence 21 physiological death is now seen as a process more than an event conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible 36 where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs in general clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death a patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring cryonics main article cryonics technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985 cryonics from greek κρύος kryos meaning icy cold is the low temperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future 37 38 cryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology the stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information theoretic definition of death 19 39 some scientific literature is claimed to support the feasibility of cryonics 40 medical science and cryobiologists generally regards cryonics with skepticism 41 reperfusion one of medicine s new frontiers treating the dead recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die 42 not from lack of oxygen but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed therefore practitioners of this approach e g at the resuscitation science institute at the university of pennsylvania aim to reduce oxygen uptake slow metabolism and adjust the blood chemistry for gradual and safe reperfusion 43 life extension main article life extension life extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan especially in humans by slowing down or reversing the processes of aging through anti aging measures despite the fact that aging is by far the most common cause of death worldwide it is socially mostly ignored as such and seen as necessary and inevitable anyway which is why little money is spent on research into anti aging therapies a phenomenon known as the pro aging trance 21 average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestyle related afflictions such as cancer or cardiovascular disease extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good diet exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes currently the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is calorie restriction theoretically extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues or by molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues a united states poll found that religious people and irreligious people as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension while africans and hispanics have higher rates of support than white people 44 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as biomedical gerontologists they try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called life extensionists or longevists the primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed location kyösti kallio in the middle the fourth president of the republic of finland had a fatal heart attack a few seconds after this photograph was taken by hugo sundström on december 19 1940 at helsinki railway station in helsinki finland 45 46 before about 1930 most people in western countries died in their own homes surrounded by family and comforted by clergy neighbors and doctors making house calls 47 by the mid 20th century half of all americans died in a hospital 48 by the start of the 21st century only about 20 25 of people in developed countries died outside of a medical institution 48 49 50 the shift away from dying at home towards dying in a professional medical environment has been termed the invisible death 48 this shift occurred gradually over the years until most deaths now occur outside the home 51 psychology see also death anxiety death studies is a field within psychology 52 many people are afraid of dying discussing thinking about or planning for their own deaths causes them discomfort this fear may cause them to put off financial planning preparing a will and testament or requesting help from a hospice organization different people have different responses to the idea of their own deaths philosopher galen strawson writes that the death that many people wish for is an instant painless unexperienced annihilation 53 in this unlikely scenario the person dies without realizing it and without being able to fear it one moment the person is walking eating or sleeping and the next moment the person is dead strawson reasons that this type of death would not take anything away from the person as he believes that a person cannot have a legitimate claim to ownership in the future 53 54 society and culture main articles death and culture and human skull symbolism the regent duke charles later king charles ix of sweden insulting the corpse of klaus fleming albert edelfelt 1878 dead bodies can be mummified either naturally as this one from guanajuato or by intention as those in ancient egypt in society the nature of death and humanity s awareness of its own mortality has for millennia been a concern of the world s religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry this includes belief in resurrection or an afterlife associated with abrahamic religions reincarnation or rebirth associated with dharmic religions or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist known as eternal oblivion associated with secular humanism 55 commemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning funeral practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased the physical remains of a person commonly known as a corpse or body are usually interred whole or cremated though among the world s cultures there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal in the english language blessings directed towards a dead person include rest in peace originally the latin requiescat in pace or its initialism rip death is the center of many traditions and organizations customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world much of this revolves around the care of the dead as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death the disposal of human corpses does in general begin with the last offices before significant time has passed and ritualistic ceremonies often occur most commonly interment or cremation this is not a unified practice in tibet for instance the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one s spiritual attainments into another body reincarnation are subjects of detailed study in tibet 56 mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures to retard the rate of decay legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures particularly the settlement of the deceased estate and the issues of inheritance and in some countries inheritance taxation gravestones in kyoto japan capital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death in most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder espionage treason or as part of military justice in some countries sexual crimes such as adultery and sodomy carry the death penalty as do religious crimes such as apostasy the formal renunciation of one s religion in many retentionist countries drug trafficking is also a capital offense in china human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty in militaries around the world courts martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice desertion insubordination and mutiny 57 death in warfare and in suicide attack also have cultural links and the ideas of dulce et decorum est pro patria mori mutiny punishable by death grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures recently in the western world with the increase in terrorism following the september 11 attacks but also further back in time with suicide bombings kamikaze missions in world war ii and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history death for a cause by way of suicide attack and martyrdom have had significant cultural impacts all is vanity by charles allan gilbert is an example of a memento mori intended to represent how life and death are intertwined suicide in general and particularly euthanasia are also points of cultural debate both acts are understood very differently in different cultures in japan for example ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death whereas according to traditional christian and islamic cultures suicide is viewed as a sin death is personified in many cultures with such symbolic representations as the grim reaper azrael the hindu god yama and father time santa muerte the personification of death in mexican tradition 58 in brazil a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório a government authorized registry before being able to file for an official death the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório though a public registry law guarantees all brazilian citizens the right to register deaths regardless of their financial means of their family members often children the brazilian government has not taken away the burden the hidden costs and fees of filing for a death for many impoverished families the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing unofficial local cultural burial which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate mortality rates 59 talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect with an official embalmer and associated rites eastern societies like india may be more open to accepting it as a fait accompli with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning to ashes of the same consciousness main article consciousness after death much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one s consciousness as one s body dies the belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called eternal oblivion belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term afterlife neither are

and extinction contemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection 61 it is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population leading at worst to extinction and more positively making the process possible referred to as speciation frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays according to darwinian criteria much greater fitness than a long lived organism leaving only one extinction main article extinction a dodo the bird that became a byword in the english language for the extinction of a species 62 extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa reducing biodiversity the moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point because a species potential range may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively this difficulty leads to phenomena such as lazarus taxa where species presumed extinct abruptly reappear typically in the fossil record after a period of apparent absence new species arise through the process of speciation an aspect of evolution new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition evolution of aging and mortality main article evolution of ageing

awareness of death was what motivated prince siddhartha to strive to find the deathless and finally to attain enlightenment in buddhist doctrine death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted the belief in rebirth among buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses 66 death is part of several key buddhist tenets such as the four noble truths and dependent origination 66 christianity see also soul in the bible second death and resurrection of the dead christianitywhile there are different sects of christianity with different branches of belief the overarching ideology on death grows from the knowledge of afterlife meaning after death the individual will undergo a separation from mortality to immortality their soul leaves the body entering a realm of spirits following this separation of body and spirit i e death

more or less opaque bluish white color in the solar system ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the sun as mercury to as far away as the oort cloud objects beyond the solar system it occurs as interstellar ice it is abundant on earth s surface particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line 5 and as a common form of precipitation and deposition plays a key role in earth s water cycle and climate it falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets ice exhibits at least eighteen phases packing geometries depending on temperature and pressure when water is cooled rapidly quenching up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature when cooled slowly correlated proton tunneling occurs below 253 15 c 20 k 423 67 f giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena virtually all ice on earth s surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice ih spoken as ice one h with minute traces of cubic ice denoted as ice ic and more recently found ice vii inclusions in diamonds the most common phase transition to ice ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 c 273 15 k 32 f at standard atmospheric pressure it may also be deposited directly by water vapor as happens in the formation of frost the transition

crystal structure of h2o ice ih c is composed of bases of h2o ice molecules b located on lattice points within the two dimensional hexagonal space lattice a 6 7 as a naturally occurring crystalline inorganic solid with an ordered structure ice is considered to be a mineral 8 9 it possesses a regular crystalline structure based on the molecule of water which consists of a single oxygen atom covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms or h o h however many of the physical properties of water and ice are controlled by the formation of hydrogen bonds between adjacent oxygen and hydrogen atoms while it is a weak bond it is nonetheless critical in controlling the structure of both water and ice an unusual property of water is that its solid form ice frozen at atmospheric pressure is approximately 8 3 less dense than its liquid form this is equivalent to a volumetric expansion of 9 the density of ice is 0 9167 1 0 9168 2 g cm3 at 0 c and standard atmospheric pressure 101 325 pa whereas water has a density of 0 9998 1 0 999863 2 g cm3 at the same temperature and pressure liquid water is densest essentially 1 00 g cm3 at 4 c and begins to lose its density as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals of ice as the freezing point is reached this is due to hydrogen bonding dominating the intermolecular forces which results in a packing of molecules less compact in the solid density of ice increases slightly with decreasing temperature and has a value of 0 9340 g cm3 at 180 c 93 k 10 when water freezes it increases in volume about 9 for fresh water 11 the effect of expansion during freezing can be dramatic and ice expansion is a basic cause of freeze thaw weathering of rock in nature and damage to building foundations and roadways from frost heaving it is also a common cause of the flooding of houses when water pipes burst due to the pressure of expanding water when it freezes the result of this process is that ice in its most common form floats on liquid water which is an important feature in earth s biosphere it has been argued that without this property natural bodies of water would freeze in some cases permanently from the bottom up 12 resulting in a loss of bottom dependent animal and plant life in fresh and sea water sufficiently thin ice sheets allow light to pass through while protecting the underside from short term weather extremes such as wind chill this creates a sheltered environment for bacterial and algal colonies when sea water freezes the ice is riddled with brine filled channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria algae copepods and annelids which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the bald notothen fed upon in turn by larger animals such as emperor penguins and minke whales 13 when ice melts it absorbs as much energy as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80 c during the melting process the temperature remains constant at 0 c while melting any energy added breaks the hydrogen bonds between ice water molecules energy becomes available to increase the thermal energy temperature only after enough hydrogen bonds are broken that the ice can be considered liquid water the amount of energy consumed in breaking hydrogen bonds in the transition from ice to water is known as the heat of fusion as with water ice absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum preferentially as the result of an overtone of an oxygen hydrogen o h bond stretch compared with water this absorption is shifted toward slightly lower energies thus ice appears blue with a slightly greener tint than liquid water since absorption is cumulative the color effect intensifies with increasing thickness or if internal reflections cause the light to take a longer path through the ice 14 other colors can appear in the presence of light absorbing impurities where the impurity is dictating the color rather than the ice itself for instance icebergs containing impurities e g sediments algae air bubbles can appear brown grey or green 14 because ice in natural environments is usually close to its melting temperature its hardness shows pronounced temperature variations at its melting point ice has a mohs hardness of 2 or less but the hardness increases to about 4 at a temperature of 44 c 47 f and to 6 at a temperature of 78 5 c 109 3 f the vaporization point of solid carbon dioxide dry ice 15 phases ice x redirects here for other uses see icex disambiguation pressure dependence of ice melting ice may be any one of the 19 known solid crystalline phases of water or in an amorphous solid state at various densities 16 most liquids under increased pressure freeze at higher temperatures because the pressure helps to hold the molecules

melting of ice under high pressures is thought to contribute to the movement of glaciers 17 ice water and water vapour can coexist at the triple point which is exactly 273 16 k 0 01 c at a pressure of 611 657 pa 18 19 the kelvin was in fact defined as 1 273 16 of the difference between this triple point and absolute zero 20 though this definition changed in may 2019 21 unlike most other solids ice is difficult to superheat in an experiment ice at 3 c was superheated to about 17 c for about 250 picoseconds 22 subjected to higher pressures and varying temperatures ice can form in 19 separate known crystalline phases with care at least 15 of these phases one of the known exceptions being ice x can be recovered at ambient pressure and low temperature in metastable form 23 24 the types are differentiated by their crystalline structure proton ordering 25 and density there are also two metastable phases of ice under pressure both fully hydrogen disordered these are iv and xii ice xii was discovered in 1996 in 2006 xiii and xiv were discovered 26 ices xi xiii and xiv are hydrogen ordered forms of ices ih v and xii respectively in 2009 ice xv was found at extremely high pressures and 143 c 27 at even higher pressures ice is predicted to become a metal this has been variously estimated to occur at 1 55 tpa 28 or 5 62 tpa 29 as well as crystalline forms solid water can exist in amorphous states as amorphous ice asw of varying densities water in the interstellar medium is dominated by amorphous ice making it likely the most common form of water in the universe low density asw

two crystalline structures at pressures in excess of 500 000 bars 7 300 000 psi such superionic ice would take on a body centered cubic structure however at pressures in excess of 1 000 000 bars 15 000 000 psi the structure may shift to a more stable face centered cubic lattice it is speculated that superionic ice could compose the interior of ice giants such as uranus and neptune 31 log lin

of a small amount of ice ic ice ic a metastable cubic crystalline variant of ice the oxygen atoms are arranged in a diamond structure it is produced at temperatures between 130 and 220 k and can exist up to 240 k 33 34 when it transforms into ice ih it may occasionally be present in the upper atmosphere 35 more recently it has been shown that many samples which were described as cubic ice were actually stacking disordered ice with trigonal symmetry 36 the first samples of ice i with cubic symmetry i e cubic ice were only reported in 2020 37 ice ii a rhombohedral crystalline form with highly ordered structure formed from ice ih by compressing it at temperature of 190 210 k when heated it undergoes transformation to ice iii ice iii a tetragonal crystalline ice formed by cooling water down

dense crystalline form of water topologically equivalent to the empty structure of sii clathrate hydrates square ice square ice crystals form at room temperature when squeezed between two layers of graphene the material was a new crystalline phase of ice when it was first reported in 2014 45 46 the research derived from the earlier discovery that water vapor and liquid water could pass through laminated sheets of graphene oxide unlike smaller molecules such as helium the effect is thought to be driven by the van der waals force which may involve more than 10 000 atmospheres of pressure 45 ice xvii a porous hexagonal crystalline phase with helical channels with density near that of ice xvi 47 48 49 formed by placing hydrogen filled ice in a vacuum and increasing the temperature until the hydrogen molecules escape 47 ice xviii a form of water also known as superionic water or superionic ice in which oxygen ions develop a crystalline structure while hydrogen ions move freely ice xix another phase related to ice vi formed by cooling water to around 100 k at approximately 2 gpa 16 friction properties frozen waterfall in southeast new york the low coefficient of friction slipperiness of ice has been attributed to the pressure of an object coming into contact with the ice melting a thin layer of the ice and allowing the object to glide across the surface 50 for example the blade of an ice skate upon exerting pressure on the ice would melt a thin layer providing lubrication between the ice and the blade this explanation called pressure melting originated in the 19th century however it does not account for skating on ice temperatures lower than 4 c 25 f 269 k which is often skated upon also the effect of pressure melting is too small to account for the reduced friction as commonly experienced 51 a second theory describing the coefficient of friction of ice suggested that ice molecules at the interface cannot properly bond with the molecules of the mass of ice beneath and thus are free to move like molecules of liquid water these molecules remain in a semi liquid state providing lubrication regardless of pressure against the ice exerted by any object however the significance of this hypothesis is disputed by experiments showing a high coefficient of friction for ice using atomic force microscopy 51 a third theory is friction heating which suggests that friction of the material is the cause of the ice layer melting however this theory does not sufficiently explain why ice is slippery when standing still even at below zero temperatures 50 a comprehensive theory of ice friction takes into account all the above mentioned friction mechanisms 52 this model allows quantitative estimation of the friction coefficient of ice against various materials as a function of temperature and sliding speed in typical conditions related to winter sports and tires of a vehicle on ice melting of a thin ice layer due to the frictional heating is the primary reason for the slipperiness citation needed the mechanism controlling the frictional properties of ice is still an active area of scientific study 53 natural formation feather ice on the plateau near alta norway the crystals form at temperatures below 30 c 22 f the term that collectively describes all of the parts of the earth s surface where water is in frozen form is the cryosphere ice is an important component of the global climate particularly in regard to the water cycle glaciers and snowpacks are an important storage mechanism for fresh water over time they may sublimate or melt snowmelt is an important source of seasonal fresh water the world meteorological organization defines several kinds of ice depending on origin size shape influence and so on 54 clathrate hydrates are forms of ice that contain gas molecules trapped within its crystal lattice on the oceans main article sea ice ice that is found at sea may be in the form of drift ice floating in the water fast ice fixed to a shoreline or anchor ice if attached to the sea bottom ice which calves breaks off from an ice shelf or glacier may become an iceberg sea ice can be forced together by currents and winds to form pressure ridges up to 12 metres 39 ft tall navigation through areas of sea ice occurs in openings called polynyas or leads or requires the use of a special ship called an icebreaker on land and structures ice on deciduous tree after freezing rain ice on land ranges from the largest type called an ice sheet to smaller ice caps and ice fields to glaciers and ice streams to the snow line and snow fields aufeis is layered ice that forms in arctic and subarctic stream valleys ice frozen in the stream bed blocks normal groundwater discharge and causes the local water table to rise resulting in water discharge on top of the frozen layer this water then freezes causing the water table to rise further and repeat the cycle the result is a stratified ice deposit often several meters thick freezing rain is a type of winter storm called an ice storm where rain falls and then freezes producing a glaze of ice ice can also form icicles similar to stalactites in appearance or stalagmite like forms as water drips and re freezes the term ice dam has three meanings others discussed below on structures an ice dam is the buildup of ice on a sloped roof which stops melt water from draining properly and can cause damage from water leaks in buildings on rivers and streams a small frozen rivulet ice which forms on moving water tends to be less uniform and stable than ice which forms on calm water ice jams sometimes called ice dams when broken chunks of ice pile up are the greatest ice hazard on rivers ice jams can cause flooding damage structures in or near the river and damage vessels on the river ice jams can cause some hydropower industrial facilities to completely shut down an ice dam is a blockage from the movement of a glacier which may produce a proglacial lake heavy ice flows in rivers can also damage vessels and require the use of an icebreaker to keep navigation possible ice discs are circular formations of ice surrounded by water in a river 55 pancake ice is a formation of ice generally created in areas with less calm conditions on lakes ice forms on calm water from the shores a thin layer spreading across the surface and then downward ice on lakes is generally four types primary secondary superimposed and agglomerate 56 57 primary ice forms first secondary ice forms below the primary ice in a direction parallel to the direction of the heat flow superimposed ice forms on top of the ice surface from rain or water which seeps up through cracks in the ice which often settles when loaded with snow shelf ice occurs when floating pieces of ice are driven by the wind piling up on the windward shore candle ice is a form of rotten ice that develops in columns perpendicular to the surface of a lake an ice shove occurs when ice movement caused by ice expansion and or wind action occurs to the extent that ice pushes onto the shores of lakes often displacing sediment that makes up the shoreline 58 in the air ice formation on exterior of vehicle windshield rime rime is a type of ice formed on cold objects when drops of water crystallize on them this can be observed in foggy weather when the temperature drops during the night soft rime contains a high proportion of trapped air making it appear white rather than transparent and giving it a density about one quarter of that of pure ice hard rime is comparatively dense pellets main article ice pellets an accumulation of ice pellets ice pellets are a form of precipitation consisting of small translucent balls of ice this form of precipitation is also referred to as sleet by the united states national weather service 59 in british english sleet refers to a mixture of rain and snow ice pellets are usually smaller than hailstones 60 they often bounce when they hit the ground and generally do not freeze into a solid mass unless mixed with freezing rain the metar code for ice pellets is pl 61 ice pellets form when a layer of above freezing air is located between 1 500 and 3 000 metres 4 900 and 9 800 ft above the ground with sub freezing air both above and below it this causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer as they fall back into the sub freezing layer closer to the surface they re freeze into ice pellets however if the sub freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small the precipitation will not have time to re freeze and freezing rain will be the result at the surface a temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season 62 but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front hail main article hail a large hailstone about 6 cm 2 4 in in diameter like other precipitation hail forms in storm clouds when supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with condensation nuclei such as dust or dirt the storm s updraft blows the hailstones to the upper part of the cloud the updraft dissipates and the hailstones fall down back into the updraft and are lifted up again hail has a diameter of 5 millimetres 0 20 in or more 63 within metar code gr is used to indicate larger hail of a diameter of at least 6 4 millimetres 0 25 in and gs for smaller 61 stones just larger than golf ball sized are one of the most frequently reported hail sizes 64 hailstones can grow to 15 centimetres 6 in and weigh more than 0 5 kilograms 1 1 lb 65 in large hailstones latent heat released by further freezing may melt the outer shell of the hailstone the hailstone then may undergo wet growth where the liquid outer shell collects other smaller hailstones 66 the hailstone gains an ice layer and grows increasingly larger with each ascent once a hailstone becomes too heavy to be supported by the storm s updraft it falls from the cloud 67 hail forms in strong thunderstorm clouds particularly those with intense updrafts high liquid water content great vertical extent large water droplets and where a good portion of the cloud layer is below freezing 0 c 32 f 63 hail producing clouds are often identifiable by their green coloration 68 69 the growth rate is maximized at about 13 c 9 f and becomes vanishingly small much below 30 c 22 f as supercooled water droplets become rare for this reason hail is most common within continental interiors of the mid latitudes as hail formation is considerably more likely when the freezing level is below the altitude of 11 000 feet 3 400 m 70 entrainment of dry air into strong thunderstorms over continents can increase the frequency of hail by promoting evaporational cooling which lowers the freezing level of thunderstorm clouds giving hail a larger volume to grow in accordingly hail is actually less common in the tropics despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid latitudes because the atmosphere over the tropics tends to be warmer over a much greater depth hail in the tropics occurs mainly at higher elevations 71 snow main articles snow and snowflake snowflakes by wilson bentley 1902 snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets about 10 μm in diameter freeze these droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than 18 c 255 k 0 f because to freeze a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice then the droplet freezes around this nucleus experiments show that this homogeneous nucleation of cloud droplets only occurs at temperatures lower than 35 c 238 k 31 f 72 in warmer clouds an aerosol particle or ice nucleus must be present in or in contact with the droplet to act as a nucleus our understanding of what particles make efficient ice nuclei is poor what we do know is they are very rare compared to that cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form clays desert dust and biological particles may be effective 73 although to what extent is unclear artificial nuclei are used in cloud seeding 74 the droplet then grows by condensation of water vapor onto the ice surfaces diamond dust main article diamond dust so called diamond dust also known as ice needles or ice crystals forms at temperatures approaching 40 c 40 f due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder surface based air 75 the metar identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is ic 61 ablation main article ablation ablation of ice refers to both its melting and its dissolution the melting of ice means entails the breaking of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules the ordering of the molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid melts to become a liquid this is achieved by increasing the internal energy of the ice beyond the melting point when ice melts it absorbs as much energy as would be required to heat an equivalent amount of water by 80 c while melting the temperature of the ice surface remains constant at 0 c the rate of the melting process depends on the efficiency of the energy exchange process an ice surface in fresh water melts solely by free convection with a rate that depends linearly on the water temperature t when t is less than 3 98 c and superlinearly when t is equal to or greater than 3 98 c with the rate being proportional to t 3 98 c α with α 5 3 for t much greater than 8 c and α 4 3 for in between temperatures t 76 in salty ambient conditions dissolution rather than melting often causes the ablation of ice for example the temperature of the arctic ocean is generally below the melting point of ablating sea ice the phase transition from solid to liquid is achieved by mixing salt and water molecules similar to the dissolution of sugar in water even though the water temperature is far below the melting point of the sugar thus the dissolution rate is limited by salt transport whereas melting can occur at much higher rates that are characteristic for heat transport clarification needed 77 role in human activities humans have used ice for cooling and food preservation for centuries relying on harvesting natural ice in various forms and then transitioning to the mechanical production of the material ice also presents a challenge to transportation in various forms and a setting for winter sports cooling ice has long been valued as a means of cooling in 400 bc iran persian engineers had already mastered the technique of storing ice in the middle of summer in the desert the ice was brought in during the winters from nearby mountains in bulk amounts and stored in specially designed naturally cooled refrigerators called yakhchal meaning ice storage this was a large underground space up to 5000 m3 that had thick walls at least two meters at the base made of a special mortar called sarooj composed of sand clay egg whites lime goat hair and ash in specific proportions and which was known to be resistant to heat transfer this mixture was thought to be completely water impenetrable the space often had access to a qanat and often contained a system of windcatchers which could easily bring temperatures inside the space down to frigid levels on summer days the ice was used to chill treats for royalty harvesting main article ice cutting harvesting ice on lake st clair in michigan c 1905 there were thriving industries in 16th 17th century england whereby low lying areas along the thames estuary were flooded during the winter and ice harvested in carts and stored inter seasonally in insulated wooden houses as a provision to an icehouse often located in large country houses and widely used to keep fish fresh when caught in distant waters this was allegedly copied by an englishman who had seen the same activity in china ice was imported into england from norway on a considerable scale as early as 1823 78 in the united states the first cargo of ice was sent from new york city to charleston south carolina in 1799 78 and by the first half of the 19th century ice harvesting had become a big business frederic tudor who became known as the ice king worked on developing better insulation products for long distance shipments of ice especially to the tropics this became known as the ice trade trieste sent ice to egypt corfu and zante switzerland to france and germany sometimes was supplied from bavarian lakes 78 the hungarian parliament building used ice harvested in the winter from lake balaton for air conditioning ice houses were used to store ice formed in the winter to make ice available all year long and an early type of refrigerator known as an icebox was cooled using a block of ice placed inside it in many cities it was not unusual to have a regular ice delivery service during the summer the advent of artificial refrigeration technology has since made delivery of ice obsolete ice is still harvested for ice and snow sculpture events for example a swing saw is used to get ice for the harbin international ice and snow sculpture festival each year from the frozen surface of the songhua river 79 mechanical production layout of a late 19th century ice factory ice is now produced on an industrial scale for uses including food storage and processing chemical manufacturing concrete mixing and curing and consumer or packaged ice 80 most commercial icemakers produce three basic types of fragmentary ice flake tubular and plate using a variety of techniques 80 large batch ice makers can produce up to 75 tons of ice per day 81 in 2002 there were 426 commercial ice making companies in the united states with a combined value of shipments of 595 487 000 82 home refrigerators can also make ice with a built in icemaker which will typically make ice cubes or crushed ice stand alone icemaker units that make ice cubes are often

forming on roads is a dangerous winter hazard black ice is very difficult to see because it lacks the expected frosty surface whenever there is freezing rain or snow which occurs at a temperature near the melting point it is common for ice to build up on the windows of vehicles driving safely requires the removal of the ice build up ice scrapers are tools designed to break the ice free and clear the windows though removing the ice can be a long and laborious process far enough below the freezing point a thin layer of ice crystals can form on the inside surface of windows this usually happens when a vehicle has been left alone after being driven for a while but can happen while driving if the outside temperature is low enough moisture from the driver s breath is the source of water for the crystals it is troublesome to remove this form of ice so people often open their windows slightly when the vehicle is parked in order to let the moisture dissipate and it is now common for cars to have rear window defrosters to solve the problem a similar problem can happen in homes which is one reason why many colder regions require double pane windows for insulation when the outdoor temperature stays below freezing for extended periods very thick layers of ice can form on lakes and other bodies of water although places with flowing water require much colder temperatures the ice can become thick enough to drive onto with automobiles and trucks doing this safely requires a thickness of at least 30 cm one foot water borne travel channel through ice for ship traffic on lake huron with ice breakers in background for ships ice presents two distinct hazards first spray and freezing rain can produce an ice build up on the superstructure of a vessel sufficient to make it unstable and to require it to be hacked off or melted with steam hoses second icebergs large masses of ice floating in water typically created when glaciers reach the sea can be dangerous if struck by a ship when underway icebergs have been responsible for the sinking of many ships the most famous being the titanic for harbors near the poles being ice free ideally all year long is an important advantage examples are murmansk russia petsamo russia formerly finland and vardø norway harbors which are not ice free are opened up using icebreakers air travel main article icing conditions rime ice on the leading edge of an aircraft wing partially released by the black pneumatic boot for aircraft ice can cause a number of dangers as an aircraft climbs it passes through air layers of different temperature and humidity some of which may be conducive to ice formation if ice forms on the wings or control surfaces this may adversely affect the flying qualities of the aircraft during the first non stop flight across the atlantic the british aviators captain john alcock and lieutenant arthur whitten brown encountered such icing conditions brown left the cockpit and climbed onto the wing several times to remove ice which was covering the engine air intakes of the vickers vimy aircraft they were flying one vulnerability effected by icing that is associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines is the carburetor as air is sucked through the carburetor into the engine the local air pressure is lowered which causes adiabatic cooling thus in humid near freezing conditions the carburetor will be colder and tend to ice up this will block the supply of air to the engine and cause it to fail for this reason aircraft reciprocating engines with carburetors are provided with carburetor air intake heaters the increasing use of fuel injection which does not require carburetors has made carb icing less of an issue for reciprocating engines jet engines do not experience carb icing but recent evidence indicates that they can be slowed stopped or damaged by internal icing in certain types of atmospheric conditions much more easily than previously believed in most cases the engines can be quickly restarted and flights are not endangered but research continues to determine the exact conditions which produce this type of icing and find the best methods to prevent or reverse it in flight recreation and sports main article ice sports skating fun by 17th century dutch painter hendrick avercamp ice also plays a central role in winter recreation and in many sports such as ice skating tour skating ice hockey bandy ice fishing ice climbing curling broomball and sled racing on bobsled luge and skeleton many of the different sports played on ice get international attention every four years during the winter olympic games a sort of sailboat on blades gives rise to ice yachting another sport is ice racing where drivers must speed on lake ice while also controlling the skid of their vehicle similar in some ways to dirt track racing the sport has even been modified for ice rinks other uses as thermal ballast ice is used to cool and preserve food in iceboxes ice cubes or crushed ice can be used to cool drinks as the ice melts it absorbs heat and keeps the drink near 0 c 32 f ice can be used as part of an air conditioning system using battery or solar powered fans to blow hot air over the ice this is especially useful during heat waves when power is out and standard electrically powered air conditioners do not work ice can be used like other cold packs to reduce swelling by decreasing blood flow and pain by pressing it against an area of the body 83 as structural material ice pier during 1983 cargo operations mcmurdo station antarctica

temporary structure made primarily from snow in cold climates roads are regularly prepared on iced over lakes and archipelago areas temporarily even a railroad has been built on ice 85 during world war ii project habbakuk was an allied programme which investigated the use of pykrete wood fibers mixed with ice as a possible material for warships especially aircraft carriers due to the ease with which a vessel immune to torpedoes and a large deck could be constructed by ice a small scale prototype was built 86 but the need for such a vessel in the war was removed prior to building it in full scale ice has even been used as the material for a variety of musical instruments for example by percussionist terje isungset 87 non water main article volatiles the solid phases of several other volatile substances are also referred to as ices generally a volatile is classed as an ice if its melting point lies above or around 100 k the best known example is dry ice the solid form of carbon dioxide a magnetic analogue of ice is also realized in some insulating magnetic materials in which the magnetic moments mimic the position of protons in water ice and obey energetic constraints similar to the bernal fowler ice rules arising from the geometrical frustration of the proton configuration in water ice these materials are called spin ice see also water portal density of ice versus

haney and lee elias 3 4 fictional character biography edit originally eclipso was written as a generic villain with average superpowers who would routinely enact an elaborate plot to fulfill his hedonistic motivations however the 1992 darkness within miniseries modified the character to be an evil and megalomaniacal entity eclipso s character laments the power he once had as a spirit of divine vengeance eclipso would frequently seek to possess beings of incredible power like superman lar gand and captain marvel to achieve his ends bruce gordon edit eclipso s early comics debut is tied to his first modern host bruce gordon named after bruce wayne and commissioner gordon as an inside joke 5 a scientist specializing in solar energy while in the jungle to view a solar eclipse gordon was attacked by a tribal sorcerer named mophir before plunging to his death off a cliff mophir wounded gordon with a black diamond afterwards gordon transformed into the villainous eclipso whenever an eclipse occurred a blue gray or purple circle covered the rightmost two thirds of his face resembling a partial eclipse 6 gordon experienced many jekyll and hyde transformations and misadventures in the house of secrets during this period eclipso was portrayed as a conventional villain possessing super strength partial invulnerability and eye blasts aided by his black diamond eclipso s transformations were later altered so that any type of natural eclipse lunar or solar would cause eclipso and gordon to split from one another while an artificial eclipse an object blocking out a light source would merely transform gordon to eclipso any bright flash of light would banish eclipso back into bruce gordon s body or reverse the change 7 eclipso the darkness within edit main article eclipso the darkness within wonder woman possessed by eclipso art by joe quesada in the early 1990s dc retconned eclipso in a company wide crossover built around the miniseries eclipso the darkness within eclipso was revealed not simply to be bruce gordon s dark half but a vengeance demon who had possessed gordon eclipso s soul had originally been bound inside a giant black diamond called the heart of darkness in africa a treasure hunter found it in the late 19th century and brought it to london in 1891 where he had a jeweler cut it into 1 000 shards this weakened the binding spell allowing eclipso to possess anyone who became angry while in contact with one of the shards he was no longer limited to possessing gordon during an eclipse but pretended otherwise so that gordon would not know the truth about the black diamonds 3 over the next 100 years the eclipso entity gathered the diamond shards with the intention of destroying them all freeing his true power when lar

american comic books published by dc comics blackrock is a recurring enemy of superman first appearing in action comics 458 april 1976 27 blackrock was the creation of dr peter silverstone in an attempt to increase ratings for the united broadcasting television network 28 silverstone hypnotized ub president sam tanner and later tanner s nephew les vegas to fill the role a third blackrock an energy construct was created by tanner s command not much later eventually silverstone assumed the mantle of blackrock himself using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight energy blasts and superhuman strength and fought superman several times this rock while a technological artifact has the appearance of a polished gem that is as black as coal it was appropriately dubbed the blackrock the post crisis version was stated in batman superman adventures to be a symbiotic alien life form rather than a creation of dr silverstone its appearance and abilities are approximately the same silverstone is the only pre crisis user of the stone that has been mentioned in post crisis continuity overuse of the blackrock s powers blinded silverstone and left him insane he was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex convict named samuel benjamin who beat silverstone to death with the blackrock and took it for himself despite its power his inexperience with the blackrock led to his defeat and superman took the stone and threw it towards the sun 29 a short time later alexander luthor jr disguised as lex luthor dispatched bizarro to retrieve the blackrock from the sun 30 before passing it on to a south american woman named lucia 31 a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by superman before her intense feelings of hatred towards the man of steel matched those of the blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it however her skills were not enough to defeat superman and the blackrock withdrew into itself 32 it was eventually shown that the blackrock had been kept by superman who locked it away in his fortress of solitude the blackrock escaped and bonded with plastic man shortly after the blackrock was removed from plastic man and found its way into the hands of batman who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently rampaging superman superman had fallen under the influence of despero as he attempted to turn earth s alien superheroes against humans although it remained on batman after superman threw off despero s influence superman was able to force it to leave batman by threatening to kill him informing the blackrock that he knew batman would rather die than live like this in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline blackrock is bradley glenn an ex con who was hired to star in a reality television show called badass nation about the life of a supervillain 33 the tv company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft they intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the pre flashpoint superman had to intervene 34 the post crisis wielders of the blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities all seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance flight and energy projection abilities the blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder dr silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from tv and radio signals samuel benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness lucia s abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain superman s power while the stone had bonded to plastic man he was not shown using its abilities much batman used it in much the same way that lucia did but batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than lucia did jimmy olsen and several other humans were bonded to the blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on earth these people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by lucia etc but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was bradley glenn s armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch blackwing edit blackwing charles charlie bullock is a superhero appearing in american comic books published by dc comics he was created by paul levitz joe staton and joey

all american comics 16 july 1940 art by sheldon moldoff martin nodell initially using the pen name mart dellon created the first green lantern in collaboration with bill finger he first appeared in the golden age of comic books in all american comics 16 july 1940 published by all american publications one of three companies that would eventually merge to form dc comics 3 this green lantern s real name was alan scott a railroad engineer who after a railway crash came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power from this he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers the limitations of the ring were that it had to be charged every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood alan scott fought mostly ordinary human villains but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal vandal savage and the zombie solomon grundy most stories took place in new york as a popular character in the 1940s the green lantern featured both in anthology books such as all american comics and comic cavalcade as well as his own book green lantern he also appeared in all star comics as a member of the superhero team known as the justice society of america after world war ii the popularity of superheroes in general declined the green lantern comic book was cancelled with issue 38 may june 1949 and all star comics 57 1951 was the character s last golden age appearance when superheroes came back in fashion in later decades the character alan scott was revived but he was forever marginalized by the new hal jordan character who had been created to supplant him see below initially he made guest appearances in other superheroes books but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the justice society he never got another solo series although he did star in individual stories and in the single issue 2002 comic book brightest day blackest night 4 between 1995 and 2003 dc comics changed alan scott s superhero codename to sentinel in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fictional green lanterns in 2011 the alan scott character was revamped his costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature referred to in the stories as the green silver age edit in 1959 julius schwartz reinvented the green lantern character as a science fiction hero named hal jordan hal jordan s powers were more or less the same as alan scott s but otherwise this character was completely different than the green lantern character of the 1940s he had a new name a redesigned costume and a rewritten origin story hal jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the green lantern corps an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the guardians of the universe 5 cover to showcase 22 october 1959 the first appearance of hal jordan hal jordan was introduced in showcase 22 september october 1959 gil kane and sid greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years along with writer john broome his initial physical appearance according to kane was patterned after his one time neighbor actor paul newman 6 later developments edit with issue 76 april 1970 the series made a radical stylistic departure editor schwartz in one of the company s earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy worked with the writer artist team of denny o neil and neal adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance they added the character green arrow with the cover but not the official name retitled green lantern co starring green arrow and had the pair travel through america encountering real world issues to which they reacted in different ways green lantern as fundamentally a lawman green arrow as a liberal iconoclast additionally during this run the groundbreaking snowbirds don t fly story was published issues 85 86 in which green arrow s teen sidekick speedy the later grown up hero red arrow developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit the stories were critically acclaimed with publications such as the new york times the wall street journal and newsweek citing it as an example of how comic books were growing up 7 however the o neil adams run was not a commercial success and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as back ups in the flash 217 219 8 the title saw a number of revivals and cancellations it changed to green lantern corps at one point as the popularity rose and waned during a time there were two regular titles each with a green lantern and a third member in the justice league a new character kyle rayner was created to become the feature while hal jordan first became the villain parallax then died and came back as the spectre

edit dc comics has been involved in two disputes concerning green lantern trade marks before the united states patent and trade mark office the first in 2012 and the second in 2016 16 fictional character biographies edit golden age green lantern edit alan scott edit main article alan scott alan scott s green lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical green flame meteor fell to earth in ancient china the voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times once to bring death a lamp maker named luke fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp in fear and as punishment for what they thought to be sacrilege the local villagers killed him only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame once to bring life in modern times the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life and once to bring power by 1940 the lantern passed into the possession of alan scott a young engineer following a railroad bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor the flame instructed scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero green lantern he adopted a colorful costume and became a crimefighter alan was a founding member of the justice society of america after the crisis on infinite earths although the original origin story was still in continuity a later tales of the green lantern corps story was published that brought scott even closer to the corps ranks when it was revealed that alan scott was predated as earth s green lantern by a green lantern named yalan gur a resident of china not only had the corps now familiar green black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted but yalan gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen power ultimately corrupted this early green lantern as he attempted to rule over mankind which forced the guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood the material from which most earth weapons of the time were fashioned this allowed the chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted champion his ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the intelligence inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the guardians was damaged over time when it had occasion to manifest itself this intelligence became known as the mystical starheart of fable centuries later it was explained when scott found the mystical lantern it had no memory of its true origins save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master this was the origin of scott s distinctive costume due to its damaged link to them the guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record thus scott was never noticed by the guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the corps sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood honoring this separate history the guardians never moved to force scott to relinquish the ring formally join the corps or adopt its colors some sort of link between scott and the corps however was hinted at in a silver age crossover story which depicts scott and hal jordan charging their rings at the same power battery while both reciting the brightest day oath during the rann thanagar war it was revealed that scott is an honorary member of the corps on june 1 2012 dc comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of alan scott as a gay man in the title earth 2 the new 52 issue was released on june 6 2012 17 in its story alan scott and his partner sam were both passengers aboard a train but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad bridge collapse that scott alone survived a magical green flame found alan amongst the rubble telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame s great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend becoming green lantern this alternate version is not a member of the green lantern corps which does not exist in earth 2 but rather adopts the name green lantern for himself for his mystical powers derive from the green the elemental force which connects all plant life on earth silver age green lantern edit hal jordan edit main article hal jordan the character of harold hal jordan was a second generation test pilot having followed in the footsteps of his father he was given the power ring and battery lantern by a dying alien named abin sur whose spaceship crashed on earth abin sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was utterly honest and born without fear to take his place as a member of the corps at one point when hal jordan was incapacitated it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on earth the other being guy gardner and the ring chose jordan solely because of his proximity to abin sur gardner then became listed as hal s backup even though he had a strong friendship with barry allen the flash gardner would fill in if jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated later when gardner was put into a coma it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task john stewart who was designated as the earth sector s backup lantern jordan as green lantern became a founding member of the justice league of america and as of the mid 2000 s is along with john stewart one of the two active duty lanterns in earth s sector of space jordan also automatically became a member of the green lantern corps a galactic police force which bears some similarities to the lensmen from the science fiction series written by e e smith although both creators julius schwartz and john broome denied ever reading smith s stories 18 nevertheless the early 1980s miniseries green lantern corps honors the similarity with two characters in the corps eddore of tront and arisia following the rebirth of superman and the destruction of green lantern s hometown of coast city in the early 1990s hal jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the green lantern corps and the central power battery now calling himself parallax hal jordan would devastate the dc universe on and off for the next several years however after earth s sun was threatened by a sun eater jordan sacrificed his life expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the spectre the divine spirit of god s vengeance whom jordan attempted to transform into a spirit of redemption which ended in failure in green lantern rebirth it is revealed that jordan was under the influence of a creature known as parallax when he turned renegade parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the central power battery by the guardians of the universe in the distant past imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten becoming known merely as the yellow impurity in the power rings sinestro was able to wake parallax and encourage it to seek out hal jordan as a host although parallax had been trying to corrupt jordan via his ring for some time it was not until after the destruction of coast city that it was able to succeed it took advantage of jordan s weakened emotional state to lure him to oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way after killing several green lanterns jordan finally entered the central power battery and absorbed all the power unwittingly freeing the parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul the spectre bonded with jordan in the hopes of freeing the former green lantern s soul from parallax s taint but was not strong enough to do so in green lantern rebirth parallax began to assert control of the parallax spectre jordan composite thanks to a supreme effort of will jordan was able to free himself from parallax rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring the newly revived and rejuvenated jordan awoke just in time to save kyle rayner and the green arrow from sinestro after the korugarian s defeat jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow green lanterns in battle against parallax and with help from guardians sayd and ganthet imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of earth s lanterns rendering the green lantern s rings free of the yellow impurity provided they had the power of will to do so hal jordan is once again a member of both the justice league and the green lantern corps and along with john stewart is one of the two corps members assigned to sector 2814 personally defeating sinestro in the sinestro corps war jordan is designated as green lantern 2814 1 post sinestro corps war dc comics revisited the origin of hal jordan as a precursor to the blackest night storyline the next chapter in the geoff johns era on green lantern hal jordan is the green lantern portrayed by ryan reynolds in the 2011 green lantern film bronze age green lanterns edit guy gardner edit main article guy gardner character in the late 1960s guy gardner appeared as the second choice to replace abin sur as green lantern of sector 2814 gardner was a candidate to receive abin sur s ring but jordan was closer this placed him as the backup green lantern for jordan but early in his career as a green lantern tragedy struck gardner as a power battery blew up in his face putting him in a coma for years during the crisis on infinite earths the guardians split into factions one of which appointed a newly revived gardner as their champion as a result of his years in a coma guy was emotionally unstable although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly he has gone through many changes including wielding sinestro s yellow guardian power ring gaining and losing vuldarian powers and readmission to the corps during green lantern rebirth he later became part of the green lantern honor guard and oversees the training of new green lanterns gardner is designated as green lantern 2814 2 within the corps guy gardner helped lead the defense of oa during the events of blackest night following his outstanding acts of valour the guardians appoint guy to a unique role and highest rank in the green lantern corps sentinel answering directly to the guardians themselves john stewart edit main article john stewart character in the early 1970s john stewart an architect from detroit was selected by the guardians to replace a comatose guy gardner as the backup green lantern for jordan when jordan resigned from the corps for an extended period of time stewart served as the regular lantern coming into his own as he battled numerous green lantern villains and played a key role during the crisis on infinite earths during that time the guardians of the universe assigned katma tui to train stewart and the two developed romantic feelings for each other they married but katma was soon murdered by longtime green lantern villain star sapphire stewart was crushed by this and his life began to unravel he reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet xanshi from destruction during the cosmic odyssey john stewart redeemed himself during the mosaic crisis when an insane guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on oa when the guardian was defeated the cities remained as the other guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the central power battery to send them home while they gathered the resources john stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities using his intellect and unconventional thinking he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society he was aided by rose hardin a farmer from west virginia who was trapped on oa due to her town being abducted stewart once again found love with rose and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on earth stewart eventually deduced that the guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted and that they let them remain on oa as an experiment in cosmic integration and also as a test for john stewart stewart passed the test and

rebirth of the guardians and the re ignition of the central power battery essentially restoring all that jordan had destroyed as parallax kyle rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear and parallax had been released from the central power battery ganthet knew this and chose kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist parallax because parallax is a

life of a playboy television star after one particularly grueling night of partying charlie was too hung over to show up on set so his brother rodger had to go on as his stand in unfortunately for roger a group of various space criminals led by former earth criminal al magone mistook the television green lantern for the real thing and attacked during a live broadcast the criminals were ones previous imprisoned by the green lanterns on a special timeless criminal planet who had banded together and launched simultaneous attacks on green lanterns across the galaxy by the time the real green lantern hal jordan arrived on the scene the defenseless stand in was dead and the criminal responsible was gone charlie was overcome with grief and blamed himself for his brother s death he demanded that hal jordan bring him along in his hunt for the murderer responsible so that charlie could avenge his brother eventually the two along with the rest of the green lantern corps tracked the criminals down and brought their terror to an end during the battle green lantern gives vicker a power ring from one of the fallen green lanterns and appoints him a temporary green lantern vicker

teen lantern an unofficial green lantern quintela is an 11 year old from la paz bolivia who receives a green lantern power gauntlet similar to krona s from a dying green lantern that she then modifies and hacks to act like a green lantern power ring powers and abilities edit main article power ring dc comics the ring is powered by willpower each green lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities the full extent of the ring s ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light early green lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring from shrinking objects to turning people invisible later stories de emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs the signature power of all green lanterns is the ability to conjure constructs solid green objects that the green lantern can control telekinetically these can be anything such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe a shield to block an attack a sword to cut a rope or chains to bind a prisoner whatever their shape or size these constructs are always pure green in color unless a lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the em spectrum the construct emits hal jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under batman s guidance the rings of the green lantern corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe they allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment and also remove the need to eat sleep and pass waste the rings can translate practically any language in the universe they possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects lanterns are granted full access to all guardian knowledge by their rings through the book of oa a noteworthy power the rings do not have is the ability to automatically heal injuries though they can provide shielding in hal jordan s origin story abin sur passed on his ring to hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries if the green lantern happens to be a skilled physician then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool but it cannot do much for a lantern who lacks medical expertise when hal jordan breaks his arm the best he can do is conjure up a cast this is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one s injured body with constructs but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one s body and concentration enough to prolong the construct alan scott s ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly the rings of hal jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the central battery on oa more recent stories have removed this weakness the effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer s willpower a green lantern with strong willpower will beat a weaker willed lantern in a duel anything which weakens the green lantern s mind such as a telepathic attack may render his ring useless green lantern oath edit green lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring originally the oath was and i shall shed my light over dark evil for the dark things cannot stand the light the light of the green lantern alan scott this oath is also used by lanterns tomar re of sector 2814 and chief administrator salaak 26 in the mid 1940s this was revised into the form that became famous during the hal jordan era in brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight let those who worship evil s might beware my power green lantern s light hal jordan many current lanterns the oath in this form is credited to alfred bester 27 who wrote many green lantern stories in the 1940s this version of the oath was first spoken by alan scott in green lantern 9 from the fall of 1943 scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the silver age many green lanterns have a unique personal oath but some oaths are shared by several lanterns they are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of aaaa or aabb the pre crisis version of hal jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals in the first adventure he used his ring as radar to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash in the second he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence finally jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used medphyll the green lantern of the planet j586 seen in swamp thing 61 all flesh is grass a planet where a sentient plant

s origin as a security guard at a future superman museum was altered when writer artist john byrne was brought to dc to reboot superman s origin in the man of steel 9 legacy edit since his origin other characters within the dc universe have hinted that there is a greater purpose to booster gold than he knows during the millennium event harbinger reveals to martian manhunter that booster is descended from the chosen and that he must be protected it is revealed that booster is destined to come to the past to protect him from an unknown event in the future 10 in 52 comics rip states that the moment booster helped save the multiverse from mister mind would be remembered in the future as the start of gold s glory years 11 later in the new booster gold series rip hints at a carter heroic legacy 12 it is then revealed that booster is important to the time masters as he will train the greatest of them all 13 being the father and the teacher of rip hunter himself who willingly chose to protect his identity against other time travelers to pass through history as the only loser of the clan despite the general distrust of booster rip and his descendants apparently know the truth always honoring him 14 due to the complicated time travel mechanics booster s future self currently operating from an unknown era with his time travel educated wife still watches over his past self and his son making sure that rip hunter gives his past self proper schooling the older booster acts in total anonymity and has access to other time lost equipment than his suit such as superboy s seemingly destroyed super goggles 15 due to a predestination paradox the future booster is revealed to be a more experienced time master than his son rip hunter but also that he personally tasked rip to school

eikṓn image resemblance is a religious work of art most commonly a painting in the cultures of the eastern orthodox oriental orthodox the roman catholic and eastern catholic churches they are not simply artworks an icon is a sacred image used in religious devotion 1 the most common subjects include christ mary saints and angels although especially associated with portrait style images concentrating on one or two main figures the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by eastern christianity including narrative scenes usually from the bible or the lives of saints icons are most commonly painted on wood panels with egg tempera but they may also be cast in metal carved in stone embroidered on cloth done in mosaic or fresco work printed on paper or metal etc comparable images from western christianity can be classified as icons although iconic may also be used to describe a static style of devotional image in the greek language the term for icon painting uses the same word as for writing and orthodox sources often translate it into english as icon writing 2 eastern orthodox tradition holds that the production of christian images dates back to the very early days of christianity and that it has been a continuous tradition since then modern academic art history considers that while images may have existed earlier the tradition can be traced back only as far as the 3rd century and that the images which survive from early christian art often differ greatly from later ones the icons of later centuries can be linked often closely to images from the 5th century onwards though very few of these survive widespread destruction of images occurred during the byzantine iconoclasm of 726 842 although this did settle permanently the question of the appropriateness of images since then icons have had a great continuity of style and subject far greater than in the icons of the western church at the same time there

iconography in the interpretation of simon ushakov 1658 pre christian religions had produced and used art works 4 statues and paintings of various gods and deities were regularly worshiped and venerated it is unclear when christians took up such activities christian tradition dating from the 8th century identifies luke the evangelist as the first icon painter but this might not reflect historical facts 5 a general assumption that early christianity was generally aniconic opposed to religious imagery in both theory and practice until about 200 has been challenged by paul corby finney s analysis of early christian writing and material remains 1994 this distinguishes three different sources of attitudes affecting early christians on the issue first that humans could have a direct vision of god second that they could not and third that although humans could see god they were best advised not to look and were strictly forbidden to represent what they had seen these derived respectively from greek and near eastern pagan religions from ancient greek philosophy and from the jewish tradition and the old testament of the three finney concludes that overall israel s aversion to sacred images influenced early christianity considerably less than the greek philosophical tradition of invisible deity apophatically defined so placing less emphasis on the jewish background of most of the first christians than most traditional accounts 6 finney suggests that the reasons for the non appearance of christian art before 200 have nothing to do with principled aversion to art with other worldliness or with anti materialism the truth is simple and mundane christians lacked land and capital art requires both as soon as they began to acquire land and capital christians began to experiment with their own distinctive forms of art 7 aside from the legend that pilate had made an image of christ the 4th century eusebius of caesarea in his church history provides a more substantial reference to a first icon of jesus he relates that king abgar of edessa died c 50 ce sent a letter to jesus at jerusalem asking jesus to come and heal him of an illness this version of the abgar story does not mention an image but a later account found in the syriac doctrine of addai c 400 mentions a painted image of jesus in the story and even later in the 6th century account given by evagrius scholasticus the painted image transforms into an image that miraculously appeared on a towel when christ pressed the cloth to his wet face 8 further legends relate that the cloth remained in edessa until the 10th century when it was taken by general john kourkouas to constantinople it went missing in 1204 when crusaders sacked constantinople but by then numerous copies had firmly established its iconic type the 4th century christian aelius lampridius produced the earliest known written records of christian images treated like icons in a pagan or gnostic context in his life of alexander severus xxix that formed part of the augustan history according to lampridius the emperor alexander severus r 222 235 himself not a christian had kept a domestic chapel for the veneration of images of deified emperors of portraits of his ancestors and of christ apollonius orpheus and abraham saint irenaeus c 130 202 in his against heresies 1 25 6 says scornfully of the gnostic carpocratians they also possess images some of them painted and others formed from different kinds of material while they maintain that a likeness of christ was made by pilate at that time when jesus lived among them they crown these images and set them up along with the images of the philosophers of the world that is to say with the images of pythagoras and plato and aristotle and the rest they have also other modes of honouring these images after the same manner of the gentiles pagans on the other hand irenaeus does not speak critically of icons or portraits in a general sense only of certain gnostic sectarians use of icons another criticism of image veneration appears in the non canonical 2nd century acts of john generally considered a gnostic work in which the apostle john discovers that one of his followers has had a portrait made of him and is venerating it 27 he john went into the bedchamber and saw the portrait of an old man crowned with garlands and lamps and altars set before it and he called him and said lycomedes what do you mean by this matter of the portrait can it be one of thy gods that is painted here for i see that you are still living in heathen fashion later in the passage john says but this that you have now done is childish and imperfect you have drawn a dead likeness of the dead at least some of the hierarchy of the christian churches still strictly opposed icons in the early 4th century at the spanish non ecumenical synod of elvira c 305 bishops concluded pictures are not to be placed in churches so that they do not become objects of worship and adoration 9 bishop epiphanius of salamis wrote his letter 51 to john bishop of jerusalem c 394 in which he recounted how he tore down an image in a church and admonished the other bishop that such images are opposed to our religion 10 elsewhere in his church history eusebius reports seeing what he took to be portraits of jesus peter and paul and also mentions a bronze statue at banias paneas under mount hermon of which he wrote they say that this statue is an image of jesus h e 7 18 further he relates that locals regarded the image as a memorial of the healing of the woman with an issue of blood by jesus luke 8 43 48 because it depicted a standing man wearing a double cloak and with arm outstretched and a woman kneeling before him with arms reaching out as if in supplication john francis wilson 11 suggests the possibility that this refers to a pagan bronze statue whose true identity had been forgotten some who have thought it to represent aesculapius the greek god of healing but the description of the standing figure and the woman kneeling in supplication precisely matches images found on coins depicting the bearded emperor hadrian r 117 138 reaching out to a female figure symbolizing a province kneeling before him when asked by constantia emperor constantine s half sister for an image of jesus eusebius denied the request replying to depict purely the human form of christ before its transformation on the other hand is to break the commandment of god and to fall into pagan error 12 hence jaroslav pelikan calls eusebius the father of iconoclasm 1 after the emperor constantine i extended official toleration of christianity within the roman empire in 313 huge numbers of pagans became converts this period of christianization probably original research saw the use of christian images became very widespread among the faithful though with great differences from pagan habits robin lane fox states 13 by the early fifth century we know of the ownership of private icons of saints by c 480 500 we can be sure that the inside of a saint s shrine would be adorned with images and votive portraits a practice which had probably begun earlier when constantine himself r 306 337 apparently converted to christianity the majority of his subjects remained pagans the roman imperial cult of the divinity of the emperor expressed through the traditional burning of candles and the offering of incense to the emperor s image was tolerated by whom for a period because it would have been politically dangerous to attempt to suppress it citation needed indeed in the 5th century the courts of justice and municipal buildings of the empire still honoured the portrait of the reigning emperor in this way in 425 philostorgius an allegedly arian christian charged the orthodox christians in constantinople with idolatry because they still honored the image of the emperor constantine the great in this way dix notes that this occurred more than a century before we find the first reference to a similar honouring of the image of christ or of his apostles or saints but that it would seem a natural progression for the image of christ the king of heaven and earth to be paid similar veneration as that given to the earthly roman emperor 14 however the orthodox eastern catholics and other groups insist on explicitly distinguishing the veneration of icons from the worship of idols by pagans 15 see further below on the doctrine of veneration as opposed to worship theodosius to justinian edit christ and saint menas 6th century coptic icon from egypt musée du louvre after adoption of christianity as the only permissible roman state religion under theodosius i christian art began to change not only in quality and sophistication but also in nature this was in no small part due to christians being free for the first time to express their faith openly without persecution from the state in addition to the faith spreading to the non poor segments of society paintings of martyrs and their feats began to appear and early writers commented on their lifelike effect one of the elements a few christian writers criticized in pagan art the ability to imitate life the writers mostly criticized pagan works of art for pointing to false gods thus encouraging idolatry statues in the round were avoided as being too close to the principal artistic focus of pagan cult practices as they have continued to be with some small scale exceptions throughout the history of eastern christianity nilus of sinai d c 430 in his letter to heliodorus silentiarius records a miracle in which st plato of ankyra appeared to a christian in a dream the saint was recognized because the young man had often seen his portrait this recognition of a religious apparition from likeness to an image was also a characteristic of pagan pious accounts of appearances of gods to humans and was a regular topos in hagiography one critical recipient of a vision from saint demetrius of thessaloniki apparently specified that the saint resembled the more ancient images of him presumably the 7th century mosaics still in hagios demetrios another an african bishop had been rescued from arab slavery by a young soldier called demetrios who told him to go to his house in thessaloniki having discovered that most young soldiers in the city seemed to be called demetrios

mount sinai during this period the church began to discourage all non religious human images the emperor and donor figures counting as religious this became largely effective so that most of the population would only ever see religious images and those of the ruling class the word icon referred to any and all images not just religious ones but there was barely a need for a separate word for these luke s portrait of mary edit it is in a context attributed to the 5th century that the first mention of an image of mary painted from life appears though earlier paintings on catacomb walls bear resemblance to modern icons of mary theodorus lector in his 6th century history of the church 1 1 17 stated that eudokia wife of emperor theodosius ii d 460 sent an image of the mother of god named icon of the hodegetria from jerusalem to pulcheria daughter of arcadius the former emperor and father of theodosius ii the image was specified to have been painted by the apostle luke margherita guarducci relates a tradition that the original icon of mary attributed to luke sent by eudokia to pulcheria from palestine was a large circular icon only of her head when the icon arrived in constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the christ child and it is this composite icon that became the one historically known as the hodegetria she further states another tradition that when the last latin emperor of constantinople baldwin ii fled constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him this remained in the possession of the angevin dynasty who had it likewise inserted into a much larger image of mary and the christ child which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the benedictine abbey church of montevergine 18 19 unfortunately this icon has been over the subsequent centuries subjected to repeated repainting so that it is difficult to determine what the original image of mary s face would have looked like however guarducci also states that in 1950 an ancient image of mary 20 at the church of santa francesca romana was determined to be a very exact but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to rome where it has remained until the present 21 in later tradition the number of icons of mary attributed to luke would greatly multiply 22 the salus populi romani the theotokos of vladimir the theotokos iverskaya of mount athos the theotokos of tikhvin the theotokos of smolensk and the black madonna of częstochowa are examples and another is in the cathedral on st thomas mount which is believed to be one of the seven painted by st luke the evangelist and brought to india by st thomas 23 ethiopia has at least seven more 24 bissera v pentcheva concludes the myth of luke painting an icon was invented in order to support the legitimacy of icon veneration during the iconoclastic controversy 8th and 9th centuries much later than most art historians put it by claiming the existence of a portrait of the theotokos painted during her lifetime by the evangelist luke the iconodules fabricated evidence for the apostolic origins and divine approval of images 1 in the period before and during the iconoclastic controversy stories attributing the creation of icons to the new testament period greatly increased with several apostles and even the virgin herself believed to have acted as the artist or commissioner of images also embroidered in the case of the virgin iconoclast period edit main article byzantine iconoclasm 12th century icon of archangel gabriel from novgorod called the angel with golden hair currently exhibited in the state russian museum there was a continuing opposition to images and their misuse within christianity from very early times whenever images threatened to gain undue influence within the church theologians have sought to strip them of their power 25 further there is no century between the fourth and the eighth in which there is not some evidence of opposition to images even within the church 26 nonetheless popular favor for icons guaranteed their continued existence while no systematic apologia for or against icons or doctrinal authorization or condemnation of icons yet existed the use of icons was seriously challenged by byzantine imperial authority in the 8th century though by this time opposition to images was strongly entrenched in judaism and islam attribution of the impetus toward an iconoclastic movement in eastern orthodoxy to muslims or jews seems to have been highly exaggerated both by contemporaries and by modern scholars 27 though significant in the history of religious doctrine the byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in byzantine history few historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period 28 the iconoclastic period began when images were banned by emperor leo iii the isaurian sometime between 726 and 730 under his son constantine v a council forbidding image veneration was held at hieria near constantinople in 754 image veneration was later reinstated by the empress regent irene under whom another council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as seventh ecumenical council the council anathemized all who hold to iconoclasm i e those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry then the ban was enforced again by leo v in 815 and finally icon veneration was decisively restored by empress regent theodora in 843 from then on all byzantine coins had a religious image or symbol on the reverse usually an image of christ for larger denominations with the head of the emperor on the obverse reinforcing the bond of the state and the divine order 16 the theotokos of vladimir icon 12th century symbol of russia acheiropoieta edit main article acheiropoieta the tradition of acheiropoieta ἀχειροποίητα literally not made by hand accrued to icons that are alleged to have come into existence miraculously not by a human painter such images functioned as powerful relics as well as icons and their images were naturally seen as especially authoritative as to the true appearance of the subject naturally and especially because of the reluctance to accept mere human productions as embodying anything of the divine a commonplace of christian deprecation of man made idols like icons believed to be painted directly from the live subject they therefore acted as important references for other images in the tradition beside the developed legend of the mandylion or image of edessa was the tale of the veil of veronica whose very name signifies true icon or true image the fear of a false image remaining strong stylistic developments edit st peter encaustic on panel c 6th century saint catherine s monastery although there are earlier records of their use no panel icons earlier than the few from the 6th century preserved at the greek orthodox saint catherine s monastery in egypt survive 29 as the other examples in rome have all been drastically over painted the surviving evidence for the earliest depictions of christ mary and saints therefore comes from wall paintings mosaics and some carvings 30 they are realistic in appearance in contrast to the later stylization they are broadly similar in style though often much superior in quality to the mummy portraits done in wax encaustic and found at fayyum in egypt as we may judge from such items the first depictions of jesus were generic rather than portrait images generally representing him as a beardless young man it was some time before the earliest examples of the long haired bearded face that was later to become standardized as the image of jesus appeared when they did begin to appear there was still variation augustine of hippo 354 430 31 said that no one knew the appearance of jesus or that of mary however augustine was not a resident of the holy land and therefore was not familiar with the local populations and their oral traditions gradually paintings of jesus took on characteristics of portrait images at this time the manner of depicting jesus was not yet uniform and there was some controversy over which of the two most common icons was to be favored the first or semitic form showed jesus with short and frizzy hair the second showed a bearded jesus with hair parted in the middle the manner in which the god zeus was depicted theodorus lector remarked 32 that of the two the one with short and frizzy hair was more authentic to support his assertion he relates a story excerpted by john of damascus that a pagan commissioned to paint an image of jesus used the zeus form instead of the semitic form and that as punishment his hands withered though their development was gradual we can date the full blown appearance and general ecclesiastical as opposed to simply popular or local acceptance of christian images as venerated and miracle working objects to the 6th century when as hans belting writes 33 we first hear of the church s use of religious images as we reach the second half of the sixth century we find that images are attracting direct veneration and some of them are credited with the performance of miracles 34 cyril mango writes 35 in the post justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons some of them rather shocking to our eyes however the earlier references by eusebius and irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century symbolism edit in the icons of eastern orthodoxy and of the early medieval west very little room is made for artistic license almost everything within the image has a symbolic aspect christ the saints and the angels all have halos angels and often john the baptist have wings because they are messengers figures have consistent facial appearances hold attributes personal to them and use a few conventional poses archangels bear a thin staff and sometimes a mirror colour plays an important role as well gold represents the radiance of heaven red divine life blue is the colour of human life white is the uncreated light of god only used for resurrection and transfiguration of christ if you look at icons of jesus and mary jesus wears red undergarment with a blue outer garment god become human and mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment human was granted gifts by god thus the doctrine of deification is conveyed by icons letters are symbols too most icons incorporate some calligraphic text naming the person or event depicted even this is

vladimirskaya above in the eastern orthodox christian tradition there are reports of particular wonderworking icons that exude myrrh fragrant healing oil or perform miracles upon petition by believers when such reports are verified by the orthodox hierarchy they are understood as miracles performed by god through the prayers of the saint rather than being magical properties of the painted wood itself theologically all icons are considered to be sacred and are miraculous by nature being a means of spiritual communion between the heavenly and earthly realms however it is not uncommon for specific icons to be characterised as miracle working meaning that god has chosen to glorify them by working miracles through them such icons are often given particular names especially those of the virgin mary and even taken from city to city where believers gather to venerate them and pray before them islands like that of tinos are renowned for possessing such miraculous icons and are visited every year by thousands of pilgrims eastern orthodox teaching edit the eastern orthodox view of the origin of icons is generally quite different from that of most secular scholars and from some in contemporary roman catholic circles the orthodox church maintains and teaches that the sacred image has existed from the beginning of christianity léonid ouspensky has written 36 accounts that some non orthodox writers consider legendary are accepted as history within eastern orthodoxy because they are a part of church tradition thus accounts such as that of the miraculous image not made by hands and the weeping and moving mother of god of the sign of novgorod are accepted as fact church tradition tells us for example of the existence of an icon of the savior during his lifetime the icon made without hands and of icons of the most holy theotokos mary immediately after him 37 eastern orthodoxy further teaches that a clear understanding of the importance of icons was part of the church from its very beginning and has never changed although explanations of their importance may have developed over time this is because icon painting is rooted in the theology of the incarnation christ being the eikon of god which did not change though its subsequent clarification within the church occurred over the period of the first seven ecumenical councils also icons served as tools of edification for the illiterate faithful during most of the history of christendom thus icons are words in painting they refer to the history of salvation and to its manifestation in concrete persons in the orthodox church icons have always been understood as a visible gospel as a testimony to the great things given man by god the incarnate logos 38 in the council of 860 it was stated that all that is uttered in words written in syllables is also proclaimed in the language of colors 39 eastern orthodox find the first instance of an image or icon in the bible when god made man in his own image septuagint greek eikona in genesis 1 26 27 in exodus god commanded that the israelites not make any graven image but soon afterwards he commanded that they make graven images of cherubim and other like things both as statues and woven on tapestries later solomon included still more such imagery when he built the first temple eastern orthodox believe these qualify as icons in that they were visible images depicting heavenly beings and in the case of the cherubim used to indirectly indicate god s presence above the ark in the book of numbers 21 4 9 it is written that god told moses to make a bronze serpent nehushtan and hold it up so that anyone looking at the snake would be healed of their snake bites in john 3 jesus refers to the same serpent saying that he must be lifted up in the same way that the serpent was john of damascus also regarded the brazen serpent as an icon further jesus christ himself is called the image of the invisible god in colossians 1 15 and is therefore in one sense an icon as people are also made in god s images people are also considered to be living icons and are therefore censed along with painted icons during orthodox prayer services according to john of damascus anyone who tries to destroy icons is the enemy of christ the holy mother of god and the saints and is the defender of the devil and his demons this is because the theology behind icons is closely tied to the incarnational theology of the humanity and divinity of jesus so that attacks on icons typically have the effect of undermining or attacking the incarnation of jesus himself as elucidated in the ecumenical councils basil of caesarea in his writing on the holy spirit says the honor paid to the image passes to the prototype he also illustrates the concept by saying if i point to a statue of caesar and ask you who is that your answer would properly be it is caesar when you say such you do not mean that the stone itself is caesar but rather the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original the archetype caesar himself 40 so it is with an icon thus to kiss an icon of christ in the eastern orthodox view is to show love towards christ jesus himself not mere wood and paint making up the physical substance of the icon worship of the icon as somehow entirely separate from its prototype is expressly forbidden by the seventh ecumenical council 38 icons are often illuminated with a candle or jar of oil with a wick beeswax for candles and olive oil for oil lamps are preferred because they burn very cleanly although other materials are sometimes used the illumination of religious images with lamps or candles is an ancient practice pre dating christianity a fairly elaborate eastern orthodox icon corner as would be found

key piece of palaiologan era mannerism the annunciation icon from ohrid in north macedonia of the icon painting tradition that developed in byzantium with constantinople as the chief city we have only a few icons from the 11th century and none preceding them in part because of the iconoclastic reforms during which many were destroyed or lost and also because of plundering by the republic of venice in 1204 during the fourth crusade and finally the fall of constantinople in 1453 it was only in the komnenian period 1081 1185 that the cult of the icon became widespread in the byzantine world partly on account of the dearth of richer materials such as mosaics ivory and vitreous enamels but also because an iconostasis a special screen for icons was introduced then in ecclesiastical practice the style of the time was severe hieratic and distant in the late comnenian period this severity softened and emotion formerly avoided entered icon painting major monuments for this change include the murals at daphni monastery c 1100 and the church of st panteleimon near skopje 1164 the theotokos of vladimir c 1115 illustration right is probably the most representative example of the new trend towards spirituality and emotion the tendency toward emotionalism in icons continued in the paleologan period which began in 1261 palaiologan art reached its pinnacle in mosaics such as those of chora church in the last half of the 14th century palaiologan saints were painted in an exaggerated manner very slim and in contorted positions that is in a style known as the palaiologan mannerism of which ochrid s annunciation is a superb example after 1453 the byzantine tradition was carried on in regions previously influenced by its religion and culture in the balkans russia and other slavic

eventually a scuola di san luca or organized painter s guild the guild of saint luke on western lines cretan painting was heavily patronized both by catholics of venetian territories and by eastern orthodox for ease of transport cretan painters specialized in panel paintings and developed the ability to work in many styles to fit the taste of various patrons el greco who moved to venice after establishing his reputation in crete is the most famous artist of the school who continued to use many byzantine conventions in his works in 1669 the city of heraklion on crete which at one time

russian orthodox church the traditionalists the persecuted old ritualists or old believers continued the traditional stylization of icons while the state church modified its practice from that time icons began to be painted not only in the traditional stylized and nonrealistic mode but also in a mixture of russian stylization and western european realism and in a western european manner very

ottoman empire between at least 1645 44 and 1777 45 western christianity edit although the word icon is not generally used in western christianity there are religious works of art which were largely patterned on byzantine works and equally conventional in composition and depiction until the 13th century icon like depictions of sacred figures followed eastern patterns although very few survive from this early period italian examples are in a style known as italo byzantine from the 13th century the western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility and a more realist approach to the figures if only because there was a much smaller number of skilled artists the quantity of works of art in the sense of panel paintings was much smaller in the west and in most western settings a single diptych as an altarpiece or in a domestic room probably stood in place of the larger collections typical of orthodox icon corners only in the 15th century did production of painted works of art begin to approach eastern levels supplemented by mass produced imports from the cretan school in this century the use of icon like portraits in the west was enormously increased by the introduction of old master prints on paper mostly woodcuts which were produced in vast numbers although hardly any survive they were mostly sold hand coloured by churches and the smallest sizes often only an inch high were affordable even by peasants who glued or pinned them straight onto a wall with the reformation after an initial uncertainty among early lutherans who painted a few icon like depictions of leading reformers and continued to paint scenes from scripture protestants came down firmly against icon like portraits especially larger ones even of christ many protestants found these

regarding images there is some minor difference however in the catholic attitude to images from that of the orthodox following gregory the great catholics emphasize the role of images as the biblia

believing that whenever approached sacred images are to be shown reverence though using both flat wooden panel and stretched canvas paintings catholics traditionally have also favored images in the form of three dimensional statuary whereas in the east statuary is much less widely employed lutheran view edit a joint lutheran orthodox statement made in the 7th plenary of the lutheran orthodox joint commission in july 1993 in helsinki reaffirmed the ecumenical council decisions on the nature of christ and the veneration of images 7 as lutherans and orthodox we affirm that the teachings of the ecumenical councils are authoritative for our churches the ecumenical councils maintain the integrity of the teaching of the undivided church concerning the saving illuminating justifying and glorifying acts of god and reject heresies which subvert the saving work of god in christ orthodox and lutherans however have different histories lutherans have received the nicaeno constantinopolitan creed with the addition of the filioque the seventh ecumenical council the second council of nicaea in 787 which rejected iconoclasm and restored the veneration of icons in the churches was not part of the tradition received by the reformation lutherans however rejected the iconoclasm of the 16th century and affirmed the distinction between adoration due to the triune god alone and all other forms of veneration ca 21 through historical research this council has become better known nevertheless it does not have the same significance for lutherans as it does for the orthodox yet lutherans and orthodox are in agreement that the second council of nicaea confirms the christological teaching of the earlier councils and in setting forth the role of images icons in the lives of the faithful reaffirms the reality of the incarnation of the eternal word of god when it states the more frequently christ mary the mother of god and the saints are seen the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models and to pay these icons the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith which is properly paid only to the divine nature but it resembles that given to the figure of the honored and life giving cross and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred objects

extraterrestrial monarch published by dc comics she first appeared in justice league of america 3 february 1961 and was created by gardner fox and mike sekowsky in all her world s finest comics appearances she is referred to as hyanthis contents 1 fictional character biography 1 1 current status 2 powers and abilities 3 other versions 4 references 5 external links fictional character biography edit hyathis is the panala queen of alstair in the antares solar system alstair shares the solar system with four other planets dhor llarr and mosteel which is farthest from antares hyathis appears to be a plant elemental with empathic control over all plant life on alstair alstairans are all plant humanoid hybrids because they diverged from the common protozoan evolutionary branch linking flora and fauna much later on than life did on earth all plant based alstairans receive part of their nourishment from sunlight and have broad leaves instead of hair the mold based alstairans appear to pass on the mold infection with a vampiric bite they also prefer darkness and seem to have stringy hair hyathis is continuously at war with the three other planetary monarchs in the antares solar system kanjar ro insect like dictator of the planet dhor kromm the metal skinned ruler of the planet mosteel and sayyar the lizard like emperor of llarr a few years ago this four way conflict was temporarily ended when kanjar ro abducted members of the justice league of america and used his gamma gong to force them to defeat the rulers of alstair mosteel and llarr placing earth in a paralyzed state left to right sayyar hyathis and kromm from mystery in space 75 artist carmine infantino hyathis was defeated and captured by the combined power of wonder woman and aquaman eventually the entire justice league was able to trick and defeat kanjar ro and all four rulers were marooned on a small planet with a barrier created by green lantern s ring around it 1 after the four of them were able to use willpower to make a crack in the barrier kanjar ro escaped leaving the others behind later hyathis loyal alstairan followers rescued her from the prison world and took her to the planet thanagar hyathis adapted alstairan medicine to provide a workable cure for a deadly plague sweeping the planet she required that the thanagarians appoint her empress of thanagar before she would give them the cure hyathis transformed the thanagarian people into a warlike race this led the thanagarian empire to attempt conquest of the planet rann hawkman was able put an end to the conflict with the help of superman and batman hawkman was also successful in deposing hyathis 2 aggressive thanagarian factions later freed hyathis and then launched a shadow war against earth hawkman and hawkgirl were successful in halting these factions but hyathis escaped 3 hyathis later attempted to overthrow the government of rann by using her telepathy to turn an alien race called the zaredians against the interplanetary law enforcers known as the darkstars the zaredian attack created a diversion which allowed hyathis to kidnap aleea strange daughter of adam strange her plans were upset by the arrival of superboy and the ravers 4 current status edit alstair now appears to be a jungle planet whose architecture is influenced by aztec design hyathis recently met zauriel agent of the presence when the mystical helmet of fate landed on alstair and was discovered by okeontis the demon in the mold okeontis represented a group mind that evolved from sentient mold on alstair and she used the helmet of fate to infect the populace with the mold mind 5 additionally the government ruling its sentient plant based lifeforms seems intent upon launching invasions of other compatible worlds including earth 6 powers and abilities edit hyathis is a plant elemental from the planet alstair the people of alstair are all hybrid plant humanoids but she has a closer connection to the green she can command any plant on alstair to obey her will she is able to breathe underwater hyathis is a powerful telepath and often uses this power to steal the advanced technical knowledge of other alien races other versions edit hyathis appeared in the may 2000 creature commandos maxiseries by tim truman here she was slain by tazzala of korrl a woman who called herself the queen bee while the creature commandos series was said to take place within main dc universe continuity hyathis appeared alive in later comics thus the creature commandos version may be regarded as an alternate version alternate versions of kanjar ro kromm and sayyar also appear in this series shayera thal s hawkwoman maternal grandmother and thal provis ex wife was named hyanthis her only appearance was in

from the 3rd or 4th century a 16th century perception of the vandals illustrated in the manuscript théâtre de tous les peuples et nations de la terre avec leurs habits et ornemens divers tant anciens que modernes diligemment depeints au naturel which means theater of all the peoples and nations of the earth with their various clothes and ornaments both ancient and modern diligently depicted in nature painted by lucas de heere in the second half of the 16th century and preserved in the ghent university library 1 the vandals were a germanic people who first inhabited what is now southern poland they established vandal kingdoms on the iberian peninsula mediterranean islands and north africa in the fifth century 2 the vandals migrated to the area between the lower oder and vistula rivers in the second century bc and settled in silesia from around 120 bc 3 4 5 they are associated with the przeworsk culture and were possibly the same people as the lugii expanding into dacia during the marcomannic wars and to pannonia during the crisis of the third century the vandals were confined to pannonia by the goths around 330 ad where they received permission to settle from constantine the great around 400 raids by the huns from the east forced many germanic tribes to migrate west into the territory of the roman empire and fearing that they might be targeted next the vandals were also pushed westwards crossing the rhine into gaul along with other tribes in 406 6 in 409 the vandals crossed the pyrenees into the iberian peninsula where the hasdingi and the silingi settled in gallaecia northwest iberia and baetica south central iberia on the orders of the romans the visigoths invaded iberia in 418 they almost wiped out the alans and silingi vandals who voluntarily subjected themselves to the rule of hasdingian leader gunderic gunderic was then pushed from gallaecia to baetica by a roman suebi coalition in 419 in 429 under king genseric reigned 428 477 the vandals entered north africa by 439 they established a kingdom which included the roman province of africa as well as sicily corsica sardinia malta and the balearic islands they fended off several roman attempts to recapture the african province and sacked the city of rome in 455 their kingdom collapsed in the vandalic war of 533 34 in which emperor justinian i s forces reconquered the province for the eastern roman empire as the vandals plundered rome for fourteen days 7 renaissance and early modern writers characterized the vandals as prototypical barbarians this led to the use of the term vandalism to describe any pointless destruction particularly the barbarian defacing of artwork however some modern historians have emphasised the role of vandals as continuators of aspects of roman culture in the transitional period from late antiquity to the early middle ages 8 contents 1 name 2 classification 3 history 3 1 origins 3 1 1 early classical sources 3 1 2 lugii 3 1 3 przeworsk

further reading 13 external links name neck ring with plug clasp from the vandalic treasure of osztrópataka displayed at the kunsthistorisches museum in vienna austria the ethnonym is attested as wandali and wendilenses by saxo as vendill in old norse and as wend e las in old english all going back to a proto germanic form reconstructed as wanđilaz 9 10 the etymology of the name remains unclear according to linguist vladimir orel it may stem from the proto germanic adjective wanđaz turned twisted itself derived from the verb wenđanan or winđanan meaning to wind 10 alternatively it has been derived from a root wanđ meaning water based on the idea that the tribe was originally located near the limfjord a sea inlet in denmark 9 the stem can also be found in old high german wentilsēo and old english wendelsǣ both literally meaning vandal sea and designating the mediterranean sea 9 11 the germanic mythological figure of aurvandill has been interpreted by rudolf much to mean shining vandal much forwarded the theory that the tribal name vandal reflects worship of aurvandil or the divine twins possibly involving an origin myth that the vandalic kings were descended from aurvandil comparable to the case of many other germanic tribal names 12 some medieval authors equated two classical ethnonyms vandals and veneti and applied both to west slavs leading to the term wends which has been used for various slavic speaking groups and is still used for lusatians however modern scholars derive wend from veneti and do not equate the veneti and vandals 13 14 15 16 the name of the vandals has been connected to that of vendel the name of a province in uppland sweden which is also eponymous of the vendel period of swedish prehistory corresponding to the late germanic iron age leading up to the viking age the connection is considered tenuous at best and more plausibly the result of chance though scandinavia is considered the probable homeland of the tribe prior to the migration period 17 classification as the vandals eventually came to live outside of germania they were not considered germani by ancient roman authors neither another east germanic speaking group the goths nor norsemen early scandinavians were counted among the germani by the romans 18 since the vandals spoke a germanic language and belonged to early germanic culture they are classified as a germanic people by modern scholars 19 history origins germanic and proto slavic tribes of central europe around 3rd century bc tribes of central europe in the mid 1st century ad the vandals lugii are depicted in green in the area of modern poland early classical sources the earliest mention of the vandals is from pliny the elder who used the term vandili in a broad way to define one of the major groupings of all germanic peoples tribes within this category who he mentions are the burgundiones varini carini otherwise unknown and the gutones 20 tacitus mentioned the vandilii but only in a passage explaining legends about the origins of the germanic peoples he names them as one of the groups sometimes thought to be one of the oldest divisions of these peoples along with the marsi gambrivii suebi but does not say where they live or which peoples are within this category on the other hand tacitus and ptolemy give information about the position of varini burgundians and gutones in this period and these indications suggest that the vandals in this period lived between the oder and vistula rivers 21 ptolemy furthermore mentioned the silingi who were later counted as vandals as living south of the semnones who were suebians living on the elbe and stretching to the oder 22 the hasdingi who later led the invasion of carthage do not appear in written records until the 2nd century and the time of the marcomannic wars 23 the lacringi appear in 3rd century records 24 lugii main article lugii the lugii who were also mentioned in early classical sources in the same region are likely to have been the same people as the vandals 5 25 26 27 the lugii are mentioned by strabo tacitus and ptolemy as a large group of tribes between the vistula and the oder strabo and ptolemy do not mention the vandals at all only the lugii tacitus mentions them in a passage about the ancestry of the germanic peoples without saying where they lived and pliny the elder in contrast mentions the vandals but not the lugii 21 walter pohl and walter goffart have noted that ptolemy seems to distinguish the silingi from the lugii and in the 2nd century the hasdings when they appear in the roman record are also distinguished from the lugii 28 herwig wolfram notes that in all likelihood the lugians and the vandals were one cultic community that lived in the same region of the oder in silesia where it was first under celtic and then under germanic domination 26 this may account for the differentiation between the celtic lugii and their more germanic successors the vandals przeworsk culture main article przeworsk culture in archaeology the vandals are associated with the przeworsk culture but the culture probably extended over several central and eastern european peoples their origin ethnicity and linguistic affiliation are heavily debated 5 29 30 31 the bearers of the przeworsk culture mainly practiced cremation and occasionally inhumation 31 language main article vandalic language very little is known about the vandalic language itself but it is believed of the east germanic linguistic branch like gothic the goths have left behind the only text corpus of the east germanic language type especially a 4th century translation of the gospels 32 introduction into the roman empire the roman empire under hadrian ruled 117 38 showing the location of the vandilii east germanic tribes then inhabiting the upper vistula region poland in the 2nd century two or three distinct vandal peoples came to the attention of roman authors the silingi the hasdingi and possibly the lacringi who appear together with the hasdingi only the silingi had been mentioned in early roman works and are associated with silesia these peoples appeared during the marcomannic wars which resulted in widespread destruction and the first invasion of italy in the roman empire period 33 during the marcomannic wars 166 180 the hasdingi or astingi led by the kings raus and rapt or rhaus and raptus moved south entering dacia as allies of rome 34 however they eventually caused problems in dacia and moved further south towards the lower danube area together with the hasdingi were the lacringi who were possibly also vandals 35 36 in about 271 ad the roman emperor aurelian was obliged to protect the middle course of the danube against vandals they made peace and stayed on the eastern bank of the danube 34 in 278 zosimus 1 67 reported that emperor probus defeated vandals and burgundians near a river sometimes proposed to be the lech and sent many of them to britain during this same period the 11th panegyric to maximian delivered in 291 reported two different conflicts outside the empire wherein burgundians were associated with alamanni and other vandals probably hasdingi in the carpathian region were associated with gepids reconstruction of an iron age warrior s garments representing a vandalic man with his hair in a suebian knot 160 ad archaeological museum of kraków poland according to jordanes getica the hasdingi came into conflict with the goths around the time of constantine the great at the time these vandals were living in lands later inhabited by the gepids where they were surrounded on the east by the goths on the west by the marcomanni on the north by the hermanduri and on the south by the hister danube the vandals were attacked by the gothic king geberic and their king visimar was killed 37 the vandals then migrated to neighbouring pannonia where after constantine the great in about 330 granted them lands on the right bank of the danube they lived for the next sixty years 37 38 in the late 4th century and early 5th the famous magister militum stilicho died 408 the chief minister of the emperor honorius was described as being of vandal descent vandals raided the roman province of raetia in the winter of 401 402 from this historian peter heather concludes that at this time the vandals were located in the region around the middle and upper danube 39 it is possible that such middle danubian vandals were part of the gothic king radagaisus invasion of italy in 405 406 ad 40 while the hasdingian vandals were already established in the middle danube for centuries it is less clear where the silingian vandals had been living 41 though it may have been in silesia 42 43 44 in britannia in ad 278 the emperor probus defeated vandals and burgundians and sent many of them to britain it is unknown where they were settled though silchester seems to be a likely candidate the city bears the name of the silingi is only one of six that existed in roman britain that did not survive the sub roman era 45 and appears to have been ritually cursed likely by the anglo saxons before being abandoned 46 47 in gaul in 405 the vandals advanced from pannonia travelling west along the danube without much difficulty but when they reached the rhine they met resistance from the franks who populated and controlled romanized regions in northern gaul according to the frigeridus fragment cited by gregory of tours around 20 000 vandals including godigisel himself died in this vandal frankish war but then with the help of the alans they managed to defeat the franks and on december 31 405 48 the vandals crossed the rhine probably while it was frozen to invade gaul which they devastated terribly under godigisel s son gunderic the vandals plundered their way westward and southward through aquitaine 49 in hispania migrations of the vandals from scandinavia through dacia gaul iberia and into north africa grey roman empire on october 13 409 they crossed the pyrenees into the iberian peninsula there the hasdingi received land from the romans as foederati in asturia northwest and the silingi in hispania baetica south while the alans got lands in lusitania west and the region around carthago nova 50 the suebi also controlled part of gallaecia the visigoths who invaded iberia on the orders of the romans before receiving lands in septimania southern france crushed the silingi vandals in 417 and the alans in 418 killing the western alan king attaces 51 the remainder of his people and the remnants of the silingi who were nearly wiped out subsequently appealed to the vandal king gunderic to accept the alan crown later vandal kings in north africa styled themselves rex wandalorum et alanorum king of the vandals and alans in 419 ad the hasdingi vandals were defeated by a joint roman suebi coalition gunderic fled to baetica where he was also proclaimed king of the silingi vandals 5 in 422 gunderic decisively defeated a roman suebi gothic coalition led by the roman patrician castinus at the battle of tarraco 52 53 it is likely that many roman and gothic troops deserted to gunderic following the battle 53 for the next five years according to hydatius gunderic created widespread havoc in the western mediterranean 53 in 425 the vandals pillaged the balearic islands hispania and mauritania sacking cartagena and seville in 425 53 the capture of the maritime city of cartagena enabled the vandals to engage in widespread naval activities 53 in 428 gunderic captured seville for a second time but died while laying siege to the city s church 53 he was succeeded by his half brother genseric who although he was illegitimate his mother was a slave had held a prominent position at the vandal court rising to the throne unchallenged 54 in 429 the vandals departed spain which remained almost totally in roman hands until 439 when the sueves confined to gallaecia moved south and captured emerita augusta mérida the see city of roman administration for the whole peninsula 55 genseric is often regarded by historians as the most able barbarian leader of the migration period 56 michael frassetto writes that he probably contributed more to the destruction of rome than any of his contemporaries 56 although the barbarians controlled hispania they still comprised a tiny minority among a much larger hispano roman population approximately 200 000 out of 6 000 000 50 shortly after seizing the throne genseric was attacked from the rear by a large force of suebi under the command of heremigarius who had managed to take lusitania 57 this suebi army was defeated near mérida and its leader hermigarius drowned in the guadiana river while trying to flee 57 it is possible that the name al andalus and its derivative andalusia is derived from the arabic adoption of the name of the vandals 58 59 kingdom in north africa establishment main articles vandal kingdom and vandalic conquest of

genseric also known as geiseric crossed to africa in 429 61 although numbers are unknown and some historians debate the validity of estimates based on procopius assertion that the vandals and alans numbered 80 000 when they moved to north africa 62 peter heather estimates that they could have fielded an army of around 15 000 20 000 63 according to procopius the vandals came to africa at the request of bonifacius the military ruler of the region 64 seeking to establish himself as an independent ruler in africa or even become roman emperor bonifacius had defeated several roman attempts to subdue him until he was mastered by the newly appointed gothic count of africa sigisvult who captured both hippo regius and carthage 56 it is possible that bonifacius had sought genseric as an ally against sigisvult promising him a part of africa in return 56 advancing eastwards along the coast the vandals were confronted on the numidian border in may june 430 by bonifacius negotiations broke down and bonifacius was soundly defeated 65 66 bonifacius subsequently barricaded himself inside hippo regius with the vandals besieging the city 61 inside saint augustine and his priests prayed for relief from the invaders knowing full well that the fall of the city would spell conversion or death for many roman christians citation needed on 28 august 430 three months into the siege st augustine who was 75 years old died 67 perhaps from starvation or stress as the wheat fields outside the city lay dormant and unharvested the death of augustine shocked the regent of the western roman empire galla placidia who feared the consequences if her realm lost its most important source of grain 66 she raised a new army in italy and convinced her nephew in constantinople the eastern roman emperor theodosius ii to send an army to north africa led by aspar 66 around july august 431 genseric raised the siege of hippo regius 65 which enabled bonifacius to retreat from hippo regius to carthage where he was joined by aspar s army during the summer of 432 genseric soundly defeated the joint forces of both bonifacius and aspar which enabled him to seize hippo regius unopposed 66 genseric and aspar subsequently negotiated a peace treaty of some sorts 65 upon seizing hippo regius genseric made it the first capital of the vandal kingdom 68 the romans and the vandals concluded a treaty in 435 giving the vandals control of the mauretania and the western half of numidia genseric chose to break the treaty in 439 when he invaded the province of africa proconsularis and seized carthage on october 19 69 the city was captured without a fight the vandals entered the city while most of the inhabitants were attending the races at the hippodrome genseric made it his capital and styled himself the king of the vandals and alans to denote the inclusion of the alans of northern africa into his alliance citation needed his forces also occupied sardinia corsica and the balearic islands his siege of palermo in 440 was a failure as was the second attempt to invade sicily near agrigento in 442 the vandals occupied the island from 468 to 476 when it was ceded to odovacer 70 historian cameron suggests that the new vandal rule may not have been unwelcomed by the population of north africa as the great landowners were generally unpopular 71 the impression given by ancient sources such as victor of vita quodvultdeus and fulgentius of ruspe was that the vandal take over of carthage and north africa led to widespread destruction however recent archaeological investigations have challenged this assertion although carthage s odeon was destroyed the street pattern remained the same and some public buildings were renovated the political centre of carthage was the byrsa hill new industrial centres emerged within towns during this period 72 historian andy merrills uses the large amounts of african red slip ware discovered across the mediterranean dating from the vandal period of north africa to challenge the assumption that the vandal rule of north africa was a time of economic instability 73 when the vandals raided sicily in 440 the western roman empire was too preoccupied with war with gaul to react theodosius ii emperor of the eastern roman empire dispatched an expedition to deal with the vandals in 441 however it only progressed as far as sicily the western empire under valentinian iii secured peace with the vandals in 442 74 under the treaty the vandals gained byzacena tripolitania and the eastern half of numidia and were confirmed in control of proconsular africa 75 as well as the vandal kingdom as the first barbarian kingdom was officially recognized as an independent kingdom in former roman territory instead of foederati 76 the empire retained western numidia and the two mauretanian provinces until 455 sack of rome main article sack of rome 455 the sack of rome karl briullov 1833 1836 during the next thirty five years with a large fleet genseric looted the coasts of the eastern and western empires vandal activity in the mediterranean was so substantial that the sea s name in old english was wendelsæ i e sea of the vandals 77 after attila the hun s death however the romans could afford to turn their attention back to the vandals who were in control of some of the richest lands of their former empire in an effort to bring the vandals into the fold of the empire valentinian iii offered his daughter s hand in marriage to genseric s son before this treaty could be carried out however politics again played a crucial part in the blunders of rome petronius maximus killed valentinian iii and claimed the western throne petronius then forced valentinian iii s widow empress licinia eudoxia to marry him 78 diplomacy between the two factions broke down and in 455 with a letter from licinia eudoxia begging genseric s son to rescue her the vandals took rome along with the empress and her daughters eudocia and placidia the chronicler prosper of aquitaine 79 offers the only fifth century report that on 2 june 455 pope leo the great received genseric and implored him to abstain from murder and destruction by fire and to be satisfied with pillage whether the pope s influence saved rome is however questioned the vandals departed with countless valuables eudoxia and her daughter eudocia were taken to north africa 75 consolidation barbarian kingdoms and tribes after the end of the western roman empire in 476 in 456 a vandal fleet of 60 ships threatening both gaul and italy was ambushed and defeated at agrigentum and corsica by the western roman general ricimer 80 in 457 a mixed vandal berber army returning with loot from a raid in campania were soundly defeated in a surprise attack by western emperor majorian at the mouth of the garigliano river 81 as a result of the vandal sack of rome and piracy in the mediterranean it became important to the roman empire to destroy the vandal kingdom in 460 majorian launched an expedition against the vandals but was defeated at the battle of cartagena in 468 the western and eastern roman empires launched an enormous expedition against the vandals under the command of basiliscus which reportedly was composed of 100 000 soldiers and 1 000 ships the vandals defeated the invaders at the battle of cap bon capturing the western fleet and destroying the eastern through the use of fire ships 74 following up the attack the vandals tried to invade the peloponnese but were driven back by the maniots at kenipolis with heavy losses 82 in retaliation the vandals took 500 hostages at zakynthos hacked them to pieces and threw the pieces overboard on the way to carthage 82 in 469 the vandals gained control of sicily but were forced by odoacer to relinquish it in 477 except for the western port of lilybaeum lost in 491 after a failed attempt on their part to re take the island 83 in the 470s the romans abandoned their policy of war against the vandals the western general ricimer reached a treaty with them 74 and in 476 genseric was able to conclude a perpetual peace with constantinople relations between the two states assumed a veneer of normality 84 from 477 onwards the vandals produced their own coinage restricted to bronze and silver low denomination coins the high denomination imperial money was retained demonstrating in the words of merrills reluctance to usurp the imperial prerogative 85 although the vandals had fended off attacks from the romans and established hegemony over the islands of the western mediterranean they were less successful in their conflict with the berbers situated south of the vandal kingdom the berbers inflicted two major defeats on the vandals in the period 496 530 74 domestic religious tensions a denarius of the reign of hilderic legends d ominus n ostris hildirix rex kart a g ine felix differences between the arian vandals and their trinitarian subjects including both catholics and donatists were a constant source of tension in their african state catholic bishops were exiled or killed by genseric and laymen were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their property 86 he protected his catholic subjects when his relations with rome and constantinople were friendly as during the years 454 57 when the catholic community at carthage being without a head elected deogratias bishop the same was also the case during the years 476 477 when bishop victor of cartenna sent him during a period of peace a sharp refutation of arianism and suffered no punishment 87 huneric genseric s successor issued edicts against catholics in 483 and 484 in an effort to marginalise them and make arianism the primary religion in north africa 88 generally most vandal kings except hilderic persecuted trinitarian christians to a greater or lesser extent banning conversion for vandals exiling bishops and generally making life difficult for trinitarians citation needed decline according to the 1913 catholic encyclopedia genseric one of the most powerful personalities of the era of the migrations died on 25 january 477 at the great age of around 88 years according to the law of succession which he had promulgated the oldest male member of the royal house was to succeed thus he was succeeded by his son huneric 477 484 who at first tolerated catholics owing to his fear of constantinople but after 482 began to persecute manichaeans and catholics 87 gunthamund 484 496 his cousin and successor sought internal peace with the catholics and ceased persecution once more externally the vandal power had been declining since genseric s death and gunthamund lost early in his reign all but a small wedge of western sicily to the ostrogoths which was lost in 491 and had to withstand increasing pressure from the autochthonous moors according to the 1913 catholic encyclopedia while thrasamund 496 523 owing to his religious fanaticism was hostile to catholics he contented himself with bloodless persecutions 87 turbulent end main article vandalic war belisarius may be this bearded figure on the right of emperor justinian i in the mosaic in the church of san vitale ravenna which celebrates the reconquest of italy by the byzantine army under the skillful leadership of belisarius hilderic 523 530 was the vandal king most tolerant towards the catholic church he granted it religious freedom consequently catholic synods were once more held in north africa however he had little interest in war and left it to a family member hoamer when hoamer suffered a defeat against the moors the arian faction within the royal family led a revolt raising the banner of national arianism and his cousin gelimer 530 534 became king hilderic hoamer and their relatives were thrown into prison 89 byzantine emperor justinian i declared war with the stated intention of restoring hilderic to the vandal throne the deposed hilderic was murdered in 533 on gelimer s orders 89 while an expedition was en route a large part of the vandal army and navy was led by tzazo gelimer s brother to sardinia to deal with a rebellion as a result the armies of the byzantine empire commanded by belisarius were able to land unopposed 10 miles 16 km from carthage gelimer quickly assembled an army 90 and met belisarius at the battle of ad decimum the vandals were winning the battle until gelimer s brother ammatas and nephew gibamund fell in battle gelimer then lost heart and fled belisarius quickly took carthage while the surviving vandals fought on 91 on december 15 533 gelimer and belisarius clashed again at the battle of tricamarum some 20 miles 32 km from carthage again the vandals fought well but broke this time when gelimer s brother tzazo fell in battle belisarius quickly advanced to hippo second city of the vandal kingdom and in 534 gelimer surrendered to the byzantine conqueror ending the kingdom of the vandals vandal cavalryman c ad 500 from a mosaic pavement at bordj djedid near carthage north africa comprising north tunisia and eastern algeria in the vandal period became a roman province again from which the vandals were expelled many vandals went to saldae today called béjaïa in north algeria where they integrated themselves with the berbers many others were put into imperial service or fled to the two gothic kingdoms ostrogothic kingdom and visigothic kingdom some vandal women married byzantine soldiers and settled in north algeria and tunisia the choicest vandal warriors were formed into five cavalry regiments known as vandali iustiniani stationed on the persian frontier some entered the private service of belisarius 92 the 1913 catholic encyclopedia states that gelimer was honourably treated and received large estates in galatia he was also offered the rank of a patrician but had to refuse it because he was not willing to change his arian faith 87 in the words of historian roger collins the remaining vandals were then shipped back to constantinople to be absorbed into the imperial army as a distinct ethnic unit they disappeared 90 some of the few vandals remained at north africa while more migrated back to spain 6

little work of the poets of vandal north africa survives but what does is found in the latin anthology apart from their names little is known about the poets themselves not even when they were writing their work drew on earlier roman traditions modern scholars generally hold the view that the vandals allowed the romans in north africa to carry on with their way of life with only occasional interference 96 legacy further information vandalism the vandals traditional reputation a coloured steel engraving of the sack of rome 455 by heinrich leutemann 1824 1904 c 1860 80 since the middle ages kings of denmark were styled king of denmark the goths and the wends the wends being a group of west slavs formerly living in mecklenburg and eastern holstein in modern germany the title king of the wends is translated as vandalorum rex in latin the title was shortened to king of denmark in 1972 97 starting in 1540 swedish kings following denmark were styled suecorum gothorum et vandalorum rex king of the swedes geats and wends 98 carl xvi gustaf dropped the title in 1973 and now styles himself simply as king of sweden the modern term vandalism stems from the vandals reputation as the barbarian people who sacked and looted rome in ad 455 the vandals were probably not any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times but writers who idealized rome often blamed them for its destruction for example english restoration poet john dryden wrote till goths and vandals a rude northern race did all the matchless monuments deface 99 the term vandalisme was coined in 1794 by henri grégoire bishop of blois to describe the destruction of artwork following the french revolution the term was quickly adopted across europe this new use of the term was important in colouring the perception of the vandals from later late antiquity popularizing the pre existing idea that they were a barbaric group with a taste for destruction vandals and other barbarian groups had long been blamed for the fall of the roman empire by writers and historians 100 robin hemley wrote a short story the liberation of rome in which a professor of ancient history mainly roman is confronted by a

woman with a series of increasingly clever schemes that involved angles the angle man was created by robert kanigher and harry g peter and first appeared in wonder woman 70 november 1954 he reappeared now wearing a yellow and green costume and wielding the angler a penrose triangle which could warp time and space in a variety of ways a text page in that issue explained that he had been recruited and outfitted by the secret society of super villains s founder darkseid only to use the angler to warp ahead in time to a point after darkseid had been exposed and deposed as the society s secret leader 37 he also began appearing in the wonder woman title once more at one point he fights wonder woman s friend etta candy 38 this angle man died in the 1985 12 issue maxiseries crisis on infinite earths 39 apparently as a result of attempting to use his angler during the massive dimensional upheavals caused by that event after the events of crisis on infinite earths the entire dc universe history was erased and restarted again with the same familiar characters but with all new backgrounds and histories in the angle man s case a still living un costumed angle man initially appeared briefly in the flash comic book series as one of several villains whose equipment was appropriated by the weapon absorbing replicant 40 later during phil jimenez s run on the wonder woman title he was revamped into angelo bend an italian master gentleman thief for hire who uses his special angler to escape authorities 41 he was caught by donna troy while trying to steal an ancient artifact from a museum even though donna as troia was trying to stop the villain the angle man formed a bit of a crush on the amazon he became so enamored with her that he instinctively transported himself to themyscira seeking donna s help when he was savagely attacked by a fury possessed barbara ann minerva later it was learned that he had been hired by barbara the previous cheetah who had lost her powers to sebastian ballesteros and needed the stolen artifacts to regain them he was also seen grieving at donna troy s funeral after she was briefly killed by a superman robot 42 the next time he was shown was among a large team of supervillains formed by the wonder woman villain devastation 43 an enemy of cassie sandsmark devastation formed the group to battle the now disbanded young justice the sophisticated thief re imagined by jimenez was subsequently written as an entirely different personality much deadlier and obsessive bend appeared during the infinite crisis storyline as a member of the secret society of super villains who were operating in the east end of gotham city catwoman infiltrated the team pretending to be a villain again to get close to the society bend discovered her discussing her plan to double cross the society and attacked her shooting her in the stomach and stabbing her in the head with a triangle shaped blade however the catwoman the angle man killed was in fact a new clayface whom catwoman had recently encountered and asked for help the real catwoman appeared and during her attack on the villains beat bend savagely with a baseball bat 44 one year later selina kyle has given up her identity as catwoman after having a child her associate and friend holly robinson has taken over the identity of catwoman bend now obsessed with catwoman and bent on revenge has targeted holly not realizing that he is going after the wrong person he has since been defeated by holly once the brutal fight was caught on tape but has been approached by a new villain calling himself the film freak apparently a successor to the deceased batman villain of the same name when the film freak deduces selina s secret identity the two villains launch an attack on her apartment in the wake of this he even threatens to kill selina s baby and to give her secret identity away to other supervillains these plans are however thwarted when selina calls in zatanna who

actually euthanized her and repressed the memory amadeus arkham decided then as the sole heir to the arkham estate to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill so others might not suffer as his mother had prior to the period of the hospital s remodeling arkham treated patients at the state psychiatric hospital in metropolis where he his wife constance and daughter

plans to lobotomize harley and attempt to kill joker in his sleep which is thwarted by the scarecrow if batman scans all the tablets and comes back to the security office where he left quincy sharp he will find in his place a final message telling batman to continue his work amadeus cell can also be found in the game the entirety of its walls and floor covered with binding circles as in arkham asylum a serious house on serious earth in the video game batman arkham city it is revealed that sharp s delusions of being arkham s reincarnation were the result of drugs and hypnotherapy delivered by dr hugo strange with the help of mad hatter scanning items related to certain inmates reveal that sharp had treated the inmates abusively notably by locking mad hatter in the physically lowest cell in the asylum with the clear intent of him never getting out whether he meant to kill him is unclear and again trying to murder poison ivy by locking her in a cell and letting her die of her titan overdose caused by the joker only for a priest covered in pollen to give ivy the needed ingredients from the pollen to heal herself listening to the blackgate inmates shows that some of them are aware

lana lang francine langstrom edit francine lee langstrom was the fiancée of scientist kirk langstrom at the time that she first encountered batman it was batman who first revealed to francine that kirk had mutated himself into the feral man bat at one point batman had captured the man bat and tried to give him an antidote to his condition but the man bat fought him at every turn he even tried bringing francine to the batcave in the hopes that she could convince langstrom to take the antidote willingly kirk escaped however and when he next reunited with francine forced her to take the same bat gland extract that he had taken as proof of her love and devotion to him although francine was terrified she knew that somewhere within the man bat s insanity lay the soul of the man she loved francine took the serum and like kirk mutated into a creature with bat like qualities the two man bats decided to marry one another at their wedding they donned latex masks to disguise their features but batman interrupted the ceremony and exposed them in front of all their guests batman fought against francine and kirk and was finally able to defeat them by using the cathedral s bells to incapacitate them upon doing so batman administered his cure to both of them turning them back to normal a few months later the langstroms traveled to las vegas nevada to study a rare breed of vampire bat that had surfaced following underground nuclear tests in new mexico while examining one of the bats francine pricked her finger on a fang and the toxin activated the dormant man bat gene that still resided in her body she transformed into a monster once again but this time with more vampiric characteristics including enhanced strength in this iteration francine could only transform into a she bat during the nights of the full moon an uncontrollable savage francine began terrorizing the streets of las vegas biting victims upon the neck and drinking their blood when news of her rampage reached gotham city batman believed that it was kirk langstrom who had become the man bat he flew out to vegas and fought the she bat on the roof of a vegas casino after the initial fight batman deduced that his opponent was not kirk langstrom at all but francine finding kirk the two tracked francine to a cave where batman ensnared her with his batrope he then administered the same antidote he had used in the past and francine was once again cured this treatment did not last long however a year later a professor of medieval history from antioke university known as baron tyme used his sorcery to take control of francine turning her back into the she bat he had francine attack and kill a former colleague of his named professor raymond arthur kirk langstrom became the man bat again and used hypnosis to break baron tyme s hold over her kirk defeated tyme and the sorcerer apparently died in his tower chamber when the room caught on fire batman consulted with langstrom about his wife s condition and insisted that he give francine a full blood transfusion kirk brought francine to his home town of chicago where she lived with him at the lakeshore manor apartments he kept a steady vigil over her condition and fortunately for them both the blood transfusion appeared to have cured her the langstroms had two children rebecca and aaron while rebecca was a normal human excluding the times when her whole family was mutated into man bats aaron was born a mutant bat creature due to the serum in his parents systems she also served as the lead scientist for the outsiders to help them with their missions in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe francine langstrom is reimagined as a more villainous character in this new timeline she met kirk as a research assistant and supposedly loved him for his conviction in developing the man bat serum for curing deafness when kirk transformed into the man bat to help cure the city of the man bat epidemic she decided to bring kirk back so he could perfect the formula for its original purpose then she would take the formula herself and transform into the she bat with some reported deaths kirk began to think that he lacked control over the beast but he discovered that francine s man bat formula differentiated from his as the bat she used was a south american vampire bat it is revealed that francine only married kirk to ensure the company that he would complete the serum and then have him killed so she could inherit a large sum of money she developed her own serum after kirk turned into the man bat in order to keep her job kirk tried to help cure her but she preferred her new form and attacked kirk but ultimately refused to kill him kirk combined the two serums in order to become a stronger beast and defeat francine and francine mocked him by acknowledging that he could only beat her by becoming like her she is later charged for the murders that she committed as the she bat 20 she is later released from arkham by the penguin and sent to attack harley quinn demonstrating that she has much better control over her transformation than kirk does she injects the man bat formula into harley and her friend tony to turn them into man bats however harley ultimately regains control over herself after francine threatens harley s friends and defeats the she bat 21 francine langstrom in other

edit main article lex luthor lillian luthor edit lillian luthor was the mother of alexander luthor and julian luthor as well as the wife of lionel luthor smallville edit lillian portrayed by alisen down had a long and prolific role in the tv series smallville lillian came from a wealthy family how she met lionel is unclear but they were married sometime before the 1980s by all accounts lillian was a caring beautiful and sophisticated person as well as comments made by lex and lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality had ambitions of her own and often stood up to lionel eventually lillian began to wonder about the special projects that lionel had she searched for answers and found something called veritas however alexander saw her going through his father s briefcase so lillian asked him not to tell anyone when lionel found out he immediately blamed alexander and forced him to tell the truth when alexander did lillian insisted lionel explain what veritas was but lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again lillian felt angered and disgusted by alexander s betrayal sometime later lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life lionel hired a nurse named rachel dunleavy to assist her rachel and lionel subsequently had an affair resulting in the birth of lionel s illegitimate son lucas it is unclear whether lillian knew of the affair or the child lillian was helped by a nanny pamela jenkins who alexander regarded as a second mother lionel was often absent from home and lillian insisted that he take alexander on one of his business trips to smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 lionel s resulting shame and constant critique of alexander bothered lillian greatly sometime in the early 1990s lionel insisted that they have another child an idea that lillian was highly opposed to presumably because of her poor health however when alexander was 11 lillian became pregnant again she insisted that alexander be allowed to come home for school from excelsior academy and lionel complied her pregnancy was strenuous and lillian was bedridden for much of it on alexander s disastrous 12th birthday which no one attended lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of st george which he kept into adulthood and later gave to clark kent after baby julian s birth lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually one evening lionel sent the baby s nanny home and insisted that lillian bond with the child lillian expressed her concern that lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce a threat that she had apparently made many times and that lionel had called tiresome on returning home from work one night lionel discovered alexander in the baby s nursery alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing julian while trying to stop him from crying lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck alexander their relationship never recovered even after he became an adult it was not until years later after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories that he remembered that lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions hoping to spare him from lionel s maltreatment alexander took the blame correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife sometime before her death lillian along with lex and lionel went to a ranch in montana to spend time together during that time a snake spooked lillian s horse prompting lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better after julian s death lillian s health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when alexander was 13 he later confessed to clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her lex also told lana lang that he was away at boarding school when lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school lillian left her shares of luthorcorp to her son and pamela lillian s death was extremely influential in the adult lex s life he had visions of his mother on many occasions when lex was shot and ended up in a coma he had a near death experience in it lillian visited him and showed lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from lionel and luthorcorp however at the end of the vision lana his dream wife suffered complications during childbirth because of lex s lack of resources and estrangement from his father he was unable to transfer lana to a better facility and she died this led lex to believe that lana died because he lacked enough money and power with these everything else in life could be secured as a result lex ignored his mother s warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption after realizing this lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son s choice when lex was injected with the limbo drug which placed its users in a state of clinical death he met lillian again who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice when lex was shot and went into a coma clark kent and lionel used a machine that allowed clark to enter lex s mind in order to find lois lane and kara kent in lex s mind clark met a young version of lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult lex in the memory featuring lillian snooping in lionel s briefcase clark witnessed lionel s verbal and physical abuse of both lex and lillian as well as watched lex try to help his mother up but lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him lillian luthor in comics edit in dc comics lex luthor s mother is named arlene luthor in later incarnations her name was changed to leticia even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances lillian luthor in other media edit lillian luthor known as the doctor appeared in supergirl portrayed by brenda strong dr lillian luthor is a scientist the leader of project cadmus the wife of the late lionel luthor the mother of lex luthor and the adoptive

achilles milo to make steroids for him that could not be detected or traced milo gave romulus what he wanted the main ingredient of the drug was a type of wolf estrogen taken from two alaskan timber wolves the steroids allowed him to win the gold medal but he would eventually become a werewolf milo used the promise of a cure to blackmail anthony into doing his dirty work romulus eventually ran afoul of batman when milo sent him to kill zoo security guard john hamner who had allowed milo to steal the alaskan timber wolves from the zoo some time later anthony will have a large charity

that causes him to spin out of control become human and rip apart 79 batman later revived him with a black lantern ring 80 powers and abilities edit red tornado is an android and his creator t o morrow designed him with strength durability and thought processing powers many orders of magnitude greater than a human in terms of raw physical strength his artificial body has been depicted moving objects weighing 20 tons under optimal conditions and his body has survived both extremes of space and deep sea pressures it additionally possesses the ability to self repair anything less than catastrophic damage his senses are similarly computerized allowing him to hear and see events far exceeding human perception in an extreme example he used his vision to observe justice league teammates attempting a low orbit rescue of challenger astronauts inside a damaged space shuttle from sea level though the images were out of focus and at the limit of his range red tornado also frequently monitors wireless communication frequencies for signs of distress though he has likened this to listening to background chatter in a crowd remaining indistinct until someone or something draws his attention to it as a gestalt entity born of the tornado tyrant merging with morrow s programming he possesses attributes of both natural and artificial intelligence he is both self aware and growing intellectually with feelings and emotions analogous to human consciousness in comparison to the metal men another group of ai heroes kathy sutton notes that red tornado s emotional depth and personality were much more sophisticated than theirs since he possessed a sense of humor and ability to appreciate puns in terms of emotional depth red tornado has been capable of forming and maintaining a romantic relationship with kathy sutton as well as a foster father relationship with traya t o morrow noted with both chagrin and admiration that red tornado s processing power was strong enough to both develop free will and promptly reject his programming in favor of becoming a hero this same spontaneous generation of a rudimentary ethical code became the foundation for his gynoid sister tomorrow woman s transformation into a hero as well who was similarly programmed by morrow with the justice league red tornado has used his computing power on occasion though this requires diverting internal resources away from physical and interactive participation giving the impression of intense concentration while his raw computing power exceeds any known supercomputer available to the league the majority of his internal resources are devoted to autonomic physical functions and his depth of personality both his artificial structure and unique combination of complex reasoning and empathy have made him immune to overt telepathic mind control even so he has on occasion been susceptible to malicious coding which has attacked his computerized subconscious and to standard psychological attacks that target his affections and aspirations unlike the flash or superman who can create high speed winds through physical motion such as running or spinning red tornado is aerokinetic with the ability to spontaneously and regularly generate wind motion in excess of a category 5 tropical storm hurricane force for winds exceeding 136 knots 157 mph 252 km h over a sustained period at lower speeds these enable personal flight through soft levitation of people and objects enhance his speed and create storms within his field of control these gusts take on a light crimson hue making them perceivable to the naked eye this effect is inherent with his signature ability and became the iconic basis for his name further this ability is an immutable part of his being and uniquely connected to his soul even when transferred into an unused clone of the villain multiplex he retained his aerokinetic abilities and transferred it yet again when reverted to an android body regardless of his physical state his maximum output has never been identified for example when under extreme duress and critically injured in a mortal human body red tornado was still able to generate f5 tornado winds exceeding 276 knots 318 mph 512 km h which was powerful enough to snap solomon grundy in half as an android red tornado can generate and maintain his winds at those speeds indefinitely never tiring physically or mentally from the exertion red tornado has undergone several major upgrades in his existence several of which improved his physical form most recently an upgrade infused his body with microscopic nanites with the ability to alter his appearance and body composition at will the intended change allows him to more closely mimic human skin warmth and touch sensations and revert to the more combat oriented exterior and appearance when desired citation needed enemies edit in his comic books red tornado had enemies of his own construct a villain composed

appearancepolice comics 13 november 1942 created byjack colein story informationfull namewolfgang winkspartnershipsplastic man wolfgang woozy winks is a fictional supporting character in comic books published by quality comics and later dc comics he is the comic relief sidekick to the superhero plastic man and first appeared in police comics 13 november 1942 1 winks has appeared as an on again off again sideckick to plastic man ever since and has been called the apotheosis of a kind of stock character of theatrical buffoons that has existed since the time of william shakespeare 2 in icons of the american comic book from captain america to wonder woman winks is named one of the most unique sic sidekicks in comics and the authors note that his portly shape and bumbling idiocy allowed for more comedy in plastic man stories 3 fictional character biography edit woozy winks is a bumbling inept overweight and slobbish man who served primarily as a comic relief much like other golden age sidekicks such as doiby dickles in his first appearance woozy is a small time crook with a unique superpower after saving a wizard from drowning he is rewarded via a spell that causes the forces of nature to protect him whenever he is in danger later stories would ignore this ability one story attempted to explain it by saying that the spell wore off after a while and woozy simply became plastic man s inept assistant his personality was based on the comedy of lou costello while his appearance was based on hugh herbert although a comic figure in both appearance and aptitude woozy does have his heroic moments thanks to his own dabbling in illegal activity he can recognize perpetrators on sight and recall their arrest history he also offers sage opinion occasionally by accident on finding and trapping criminals such as noticing a scene s tire track resembles a suspect s tread design winks also is able to hold his own in a fist fight sometimes taking on several opponents one history of woozy which appeared in the plastic man special in 1999 gave him an alternative origin in this tale he was an extremely competent and intelligent agent known as green cobra whose only oddities were his dress sense and a tendency to steal office supplies after being paired together for the first time he was trapped in a poorly ventilated locker with a wounded plastic man the fumes from plastic man s blood which was similar in composition to airplane glue damaged winks s brain making him woozy forevermore this is contradicted both by his golden age and modern origins in which he is depicted as having always been dimwitted a later modern age appearance shows woozy being consulted by plastic man now a member of the justice league for advice this was when many members of the league plas included were having identity crises 4 woozy features in countdown to mystery assisting the eclipso corrupted plastic man in committing crimes he seems to have gone back to his original origin and mentions that he never really gave up being a criminal in other media edit woozy winks appears in the batman the brave and the bold episode death race to oblivion voiced by stephen root impersonating charlie callas he appears in mongul s race with plastic man as the race car both he and plastic man are the first to be eliminated he is also shown to have a crush on catwoman in the episode long arm of the law he appeared again with plastic man and his family including baby plas from the old series the plastic man comedy adventure show in this episode plastic man formally swears him in as a

eest 2 3 4 ˈvɪl vil 4 dəb also called gnu njuː new or nuː noo 5 6 7 are antelopes of the genus connochaetes and native to eastern and southern africa they belong to the family bovidae which includes true antelopes cattle goats sheep and other even toed horned ungulates there are two species of wildebeest the black wildebeest or white tailed gnu c gnou and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu c taurinus fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago resulting in a northern and a southern species the blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species while the black wildebeest changed more as adaptation to its open grassland habitat in the south the most obvious ways of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are oriented 8 in east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd a fact necessary for their survival nevertheless some fall prey to large carnivores especially the spotted hyena wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators they are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle illegal hunting does take place but the population trend is fairly stable wildebeest can also be

bees cattle while connochaetes derives from the ancient greek words κόννος kónnos beard 9 and χαίτη khaítē flowing hair mane 10 11 some sources claim the name gnu originates from the khoekhoe name for these animals t gnu 12 others contend the name and its pronunciation in english go back to the word nu used for the black wildebeest by the san people 13 classification edit taxonomy and evolution edit the wildebeest genus connochaetes is placed under the family bovidae and subfamily alcelaphinae where its closest relatives are the hartebeest alcelaphus spp the hirola beatragus hunteri and species in the genus damaliscus such as the topi the tsessebe the blesbok and the bontebok 14 the name connochaetes was given by german zoologist hinrich lichtenstein in 1812 14 15 dutch settlers first discovered wildebeest in about 1700 on their way to the interior of south africa due to their resemblance to wild cattle these people called them wild ox or wildebeest the blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of south africa a century later in the 1800s 16 in the early 20th century one species of the wildebeest c albojubatus was identified in eastern africa in 1914 two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced namely gorgon a albojubatus athi white bearded wildebeest and g a mearnsi loita white bearded wildebeest however in 1939 the two were once again merged into a single race connochaetes taurinus albojubatus in the mid 20th century two separate forms were recognised gorgon taurinus hecki and g t albojubatus 16 finally two distinct types of wildebeest the blue and black wildebeest were identified the blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus gorgon 17 18 while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus connochaetes today they are united in the single genus connochaetes with the black wildebeest being named c gnou and the blue wildebeest c taurinus 14 according to a mitochondrial dna analysis the black wildebeest are estimated to have diverged from the main lineage during the middle pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago 19 a divergence rate around 2 has been calculated 18 the split does not seem to have been driven by competition for resources but instead because each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level 20 failed verification blue wildebeest fossils dating back some 2 5 million years ago are common and widespread they have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the cradle of humankind north of johannesburg elsewhere in south africa they are plentiful at such sites as elandsfontein cornelia and florisbad 21 the earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in cornelia in the free state and dated back about 800 000 years 20 today five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies 22 23 genetics and hybrids edit the diploid number of chromosomes in the wildebeest is 58 24 chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest in the female all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes were found to be acrocentric metaphases were studied in the male s chromosomes and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well similar to those in the female both in size and morphology other chromosomes were acrocentric the x chromosome is a large acrocentric and the y chromosome a minute one 15 25 the two species of the wildebeest are known to hybridise male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa 26 the differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species but hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area the resulting offspring are usually fertile a study of these hybrid animals at spioenkop dam nature reserve in south africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth horns and the wormian bones in the skull 27 another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents in some animals the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused 28 characteristics of the species edit wildebeestblue wildebeestblack wildebeest both species of wildebeest are even toed horned greyish brown ungulates resembling cattle males are larger than females and both have heavy forequarters compared to their hindquarters they have broad muzzles roman noses and shaggy manes and tails 29 the most striking morphological differences between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horns and the colour of their coats the blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two species in males blue wildebeest stand 150 cm 59 in tall at the shoulder and weigh around 250 kg 550 lb while the black wildebeest stands 111 120 cm 44 47 in tall 30 and weighs about 180 kg 400 lb in females blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of 135 cm 53 in and weigh 180 kg 400 lb while black wildebeest females stand 108 cm 43 in at the shoulder and weigh 155 kg 342 lb the horns of blue wildebeest protrude to the side then curve downwards before curving up back towards the skull while the horns of the black wildebeest curve forward then downward before curving upwards at the tips blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey colour with stripes but may have a bluish sheen the black wildebeest has brown coloured hair with a mane that ranges in colour from cream to black and a cream coloured tail the blue wildebeest lives in a wide variety of habitats including woodlands and grasslands while the black wildebeest tends to reside exclusively in open grassland areas 22 in some areas the blue wildebeest migrates over long distances in the winter whereas the black wildebeest does not 31 the milk of the female black wildebeest contains a higher protein lower fat and lower lactose content than the milk of the blue wildebeest 32 wildebeest can live more than 40 years though their average lifespan is around 20 years 33 distribution and habitat edit wildebeest inhabit the plains and open woodlands of parts of africa south of the sahara the black wildebeest is native to the southernmost parts of the continent 34 its historical range included south africa eswatini and lesotho but in the latter two countries it was hunted to extinction in the 19th century it has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to namibia where it has become well established 35 it inhabits open plains grasslands and karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills at altitudes varying between 1 350 and 2 150 m 4 430 and 7 050 ft 36 in the past it inhabited the highveld temperate grasslands during the dry winter season and the arid karoo region during the rains however as a result of widespread hunting the black wildebeest no longer occupies its historical range or makes migrations and is now largely limited to game farms and protected reserves 37 the blue wildebeest is native to eastern and southern africa its range includes kenya tanzania botswana zambia zimbabwe mozambique south africa eswatini and angola 38 it is no longer found in malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into namibia blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush covered acacia savannas thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too dry they can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains 36 in east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species both in population and biomass 29 it is a notable feature of the serengeti national park in tanzania the maasai mara national reserve in kenya and the liuwa plain national park in zambia 33 migration edit see also serengeti great migration migration in wildebeestwildebeest herding and following zebra in the serengeti national parkwildebeest in masai mara during the great migrationwildebeest leaping into the mara river during their great migration not all wildebeest are migratory black wildebeest herds are often nomadic or may have a regular home range of 1 km2 0 39 sq mi bulls may occupy territories usually about 100 to 400 m 300 to 1 300 ft apart but this spacing varies according to the quality of the habitat in favourable conditions they may be as close as 9 m 30 ft or they may be as far apart as 1 600 m 5 200 ft in poor habitat 17 female herds have home ranges of about 250 acres 100 ha 0 39 sq mi in size herds of nonterritorial bachelor males roam at will and do not seem to have any restrictions on where they wander 39 blue wildebeest have both migratory and sedentary populations in the ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain a network of territories throughout the year though breeding is seasonal in nature females and young form groups of about 10 individuals or join in larger aggregations and nonterritorial males form bachelor groups 40 in the serengeti and tarangire ecosystems populations are mostly migratory with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving but resident subpopulations also exist 41 during the rutting season the males may form temporary territories for a few hours or a day or so and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate but soon they have to move on often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory 40 in the maasai mara game reserve a non migratory population of blue wildebeest had dwindled from about 119 000 animals in 1977 to about 22 000 in 1997 the reason for the decline is thought to be the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices and possibly fluctuations in rainfall 42 each year some east african populations of blue wildebeest have a long distance migration seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth 43 the timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably by months from year to year at the end of the wet season may or june in east africa wildebeest migrate to dry season areas in response to a lack of surface drinking water when the rainy season begins again months later animals quickly move back to their wet season ranges factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance surface water availability predators and phosphorus content in grasses phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms particularly for lactating female bovids as a result during the rainy season wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels 29 one study found in addition to phosphorus wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content 44 aerial photography has revealed that a level of organisation occurs in the movement of the herd that cannot be apparent to each individual animal for example the migratory herd exhibits a wavy front and this suggests that some degree of local decision making is taking place 45 numerous documentaries feature wildebeest crossing rivers with many being eaten by crocodiles or drowning in the attempt while having the appearance of a frenzy recent research has shown a herd of wildebeest possesses what is known as a swarm intelligence whereby the animals systematically explore and overcome the obstacle as one 46 ecology edit predators edit major predators that feed on wildebeest include the lion hyena african wild dog cheetah leopard and crocodile which seem to favour the wildebeest over other prey 33 wildebeest however are very strong and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion wildebeest have a maximum running speed of around 80 km h 50 mph 47 48 the primary defensive tactic is herding where the young animals are protected by the older larger ones while the herd runs as a group typically the predators attempt to isolate a young or ill animal and attack without having to worry about the herd wildebeest have developed additional sophisticated cooperative behaviours such as animals taking turns sleeping while others stand guard against a night attack by invading predators wildebeest migrations are closely followed by vultures as wildebeest carcasses are an important source of food for these scavengers the vultures consume about 70 of the wildebeest carcasses available decreases in the number of migrating wildebeest have also had a negative effect on the vultures 49 in the serengeti ecosystem tanzania wildebeest may help facilitate the migration of other smaller bodied grazers such as thomson s gazelles eudorcas thomsonii which eat the new growth grasses stimulated by wildebeest foraging 50 interactions with nonpredators edit zebras and wildebeest group together in open savannah environments with high chances of predation this grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual s chance of being hunted and predators are more easily seen in open areas 51 the seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves resulting in greater survival of giraffes 52 wildebeest can also listen in on the alarm calls of other species and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation one study showed along with other ungulates wildebeests responded more strongly to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls though both types of calls had similar patterns amplitudes and durations the alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred 53 wildebeest compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle 54 breeding and reproduction edit video of wildebeest feeding its calf wildebeest do not form permanent pair bonds and during the mating season or rut the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them these small territories are about 3 000 square metres 32 000 sq ft 0 74 acres with up to 300 territories per 1 square kilometre 0 39 sq mi 250 acres the males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into oestrus the males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness 29 this usually occurs between may and july and birthing usually takes place between january and march at the start of the wet season wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously 55 the estrous cycle is about 23 days and the gestation period lasts 250 to 260 days the calves weigh about 21 kg 46 lb at birth 11 and scramble to their feet within minutes being able to move with the herd soon afterwards 33 a fact on which their survival relies 56 the main predator of the calves is the spotted hyena the calving peak period lasts for 2 3 weeks and in small subpopulations and isolated groups mortality of calves may be as high as 50 however in larger aggregations or small groups living near large herds mortality rates may be under 20 57 groups of wildebeest females and young live in the small areas established by the male when groups of wildebeest join the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose to move to the areas held by a smaller number of males 51 this female dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting 58 threats and conservation edit the black wildebeest has been classified as a least concern species by the international union for conservation of nature in the iucn red list the populations of this species are on an increase now more than 18 000 individuals are believed to remain 7 000 of which are in namibia outside their natural range and where it is farmed around 80 of the wildebeest occurs in private areas while the other 20 is confined in protected areas its introduction into namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from 150 in 1982 to 7 000 in 1992 35 bag made with wildebeest skin the blue wildebeest has also been rated as of least concern the population trend is stable and their numbers are estimated to be around 1 500 000 mainly due to the increase of the populations in serengeti national park tanzania to 1 300 000 as of 1998 59 however the numbers of one of the subspecies the eastern white bearded wildebeest c t albojubatus have seen a steep decline 41 population density ranges from 0 15 km2 in hwange and etosha national parks to 35 km2 in ngorongoro conservation area and serengeti national park 36 overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes which are increasingly difficult to maintain particularly over the long term when human demands on the landscape compete the most acute threat comes from migration barriers such as fences and roads in one of the more striking examples of the consequences of fence building on terrestrial migrations botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10 of its previous size 60 illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas along with natural threats posed by main predators which include lions leopards african hunting dogs cheetahs and hyenas where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range the two can hybridise and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest 26 uses and interaction with humans edit taxidermied lion and blue wildebeest namibia wildebeest provide several useful animal products the hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse dry and rather hard 17 wildebeest are killed for food especially to make biltong in southern africa this dried game meat is a delicacy and an important food item in africa 29 the meat of females is more tender than that of males and is the most tender during the autumn season 31 wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into 11 pieces the estimated price for wildebeest meat was about us 0 47 per 1 kilogram 2 2 lb around 2008 61 the silky flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make fly whisks or chowries 17 wildebeest benefit the ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta they are economically important for human beings as they are a major tourist attraction they also provide important products such as leather to humans 62 wildebeest however can also have a negative impact on humans wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock and can transmit diseases and cause epidemics among animals particularly domestic cattle they can also spread ticks lungworms tapeworms flies and paramphistome flukes 16 cultural depictions edit the wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arms of the province of natal and later kwazulu natal in south africa over the years the south african authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the south african mint has struck a two cent piece with a prancing black wildebeest 63 movies and television shows also feature wildebeests including khumba mama v the wild kazar and his minions all hail king julien vigman wildebeest phineas and ferb newton the gnu the great space coaster newscaster gary gnu and the lion king the wildebeest stampede that resulted in mufasa s death michael flanders wrote a humorous song called the gnu which was very popular when he performed it with donald swann in a revue called at the drop of a hat which opened in london on 31 december 1956 in the 1970s british tea brand typhoo ran a series of television advertisements featuring an animated anthropomorphic gnu character the wildebeest is the mascot of the free software project gnu the wildebeest is the mascot of the gnu project 64 and gnu operating system in the llama llama picture book series by anna dewdney an

all other species in canini foxes are small to medium sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae they have a flattened skull upright triangular ears a pointed slightly upturned snout and a long bushy tail or brush twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus vulpes approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american foxes or of the outlying group which consists of the bat eared fox gray fox and island fox 1 foxes live on every continent except antarctica the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes with about 47 recognized subspecies 2 the global distribution of foxes together with their widespread reputation for cunning has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds long an established

which derived from proto germanic fuhsaz nb 1 this in turn derives from proto indo european puḱ meaning thick haired tail nb 2 male foxes are known as dogs tods or reynards females as vixens and young as cubs pups or kits though the last name is not to be confused with a distinct species called kit foxes vixen is one of very few words in modern english that retain the middle english southern

illustration of skulls of a true fox left and gray fox right with differing temporal ridges and subangular lobes indicated within the canidae the results of dna analysis shows several phylogenetic divisions the fox like canids which include the kit fox vulpes velox red fox vulpes vulpes cape fox vulpes chama arctic fox vulpes lagopus and fennec fox vulpes zerda 6 the wolf like canids genus canis cuon and lycaon including the dog canis lupus familiaris gray wolf canis lupus red wolf canis rufus eastern wolf canis lycaon coyote canis latrans golden jackal canis aureus ethiopian wolf canis

cinereoargenteus and raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides 6 biology fox skeleton general morphology foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family canidae such as wolves and jackals while they may be larger than some within the family such as raccoon dogs in the largest species the red fox males weigh on average between 4 1 and 8 7 kilograms 9 and 19 1 4 pounds 7 while the smallest species the fennec fox weighs just 0 7 to 1 6 kg 1 1 2 to 3 1 2 lb 8 fox features typically include a triangular face pointed ears an elongated rostrum and a bushy tail they are digitigrade meaning they walk on their toes unlike most members of the family canidae foxes have partially retractable claws 9 fox vibrissae or whiskers are black the whiskers on the muzzle known as mystacial vibrissae average 100 110 millimetres 3 7 8 4 3 8 inches long while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length whiskers carpal vibrissae are also on the forelimbs and average 40 mm 1 5 8 in long pointing downward and backward 2 other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and adaptive significance pelage fox species differ in fur color length and density coat colors range from pearly white to black and white to black flecked with white or grey on the underside fennec foxes and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert such as kit foxes for example have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool 2 9 arctic foxes on the other hand have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick insulating fur which aid in keeping the body warm 10 red foxes by contrast have a typical auburn pelt the tail normally ending with a white marking 11 a fox s coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months to get rid of the dense winter coat foxes moult once a year around april the process begins from the feet up the legs and then along the back 9 coat color may also change as the individual ages 2 dentition a fox s dentition like all other canids is i 3 3 c 1 1 pm 4 4 m 3 2 42 bat eared foxes have six extra molars totalling in 48 teeth foxes have pronounced carnassial pairs which is characteristic of a carnivore these pairs consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar and work together to shear tough material like flesh foxes canines are pronounced also characteristic of a carnivore and are excellent in gripping prey 12 behaviour arctic fox curled up in snow in the wild the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years although individuals may live up to ten years unlike many canids foxes are not always pack animals typically they live in small family groups but some such as arctic foxes are known to be solitary 2 9 foxes are omnivores 13 14 their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds they may also eat eggs and vegetation many species are generalist predators but some such as the crab eating fox have more specialized diets most species of fox consume around 1 kg 2 2 lb of food every day foxes cache excess food burying it for later consumption usually under leaves snow or soil 9 15 while hunting foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey 2 using their pronounced canine teeth they can then grip the prey s neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled 2 the gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees the other is the raccoon dog 16 sexual characteristics the male fox s scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend like other canines the male fox has a baculum or penile bone 2 17 18 the testes of red foxes are smaller than those of arctic foxes 19 sperm formation in red foxes begins in august september with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in december february 20 vixens are in heat for one to six days making their reproductive cycle twelve months long as with other canines the ova are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating once the egg is fertilized the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from 52 to 53 days foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant 2 21 litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environment the arctic fox for example can have up to eleven kits 22 the vixen usually has six or eight mammae 23 each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts which connect the mammary gland to the nipple allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple citation needed vocalization the fox s vocal repertoire is vast and includes whine made shortly after birth occurs at a high rate when kits are hungry and when their body temperatures are low whining stimulates the mother to care for her young it also has been known to stimulate the male fox into caring for his mate and kits yelp made about 19 days later the kits whining turns into infantile barks yelps which occur heavily during play explosive call at the age of about one month the kits can emit an explosive call which is intended to be threatening to intruders or other cubs a high pitched howl combative call in adults the explosive call becomes an open mouthed combative call during any conflict a sharper bark growl an adult fox s indication to their kits to feed or head to the adult s location bark adult foxes warn against intruders and in defense by barking 2 24 in the case of domesticated foxes the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners 2 classification canids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species 2 genus species

species several fox species are endangered in their native environments pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts other trade or control 25 due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals 26 contrastingly foxes while often considered pests themselves have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact 27 island fox urocyon littoralis the island fox though considered a near threatened species throughout the world is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the california channel islands 28 a population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space food and shelter 29 island populations are therefore highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather 29 on the california channel islands it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000 30 as well as predation by non native golden eagles 31 since 1993 the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95 30 because of the low number of foxes the population went through an allee effect an effect in which at low enough densities an individual s fitness decreases 28 conservationists had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild 30 nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles 31 darwin s fox pseudalopex fulvipes darwin s fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution 32 on the chilean mainland the population is limited to nahuelbuta national park and the surrounding valdivian rainforest 32 similarly on chiloé island their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwesternmost part of the island 32 though the nahuelbuta national park is protected 90 of the species live on chiloé island 33 a major issue the species faces is their dwindling limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests 32 because of deforestation the darwin s fox habitat is shrinking allowing for their competitor s chilla fox preferred habitat of open space to increase the darwin s fox subsequently is being outcompeted 34 another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs 32 to conserve these animals researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the nahuelbuta national park to the coast of chile and in turn chiloé island and its forests to be protected 34 they also suggest that other forests around chile be examined to determine whether darwin s foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise 34 and finally the researchers advise for the creation of a captive breeding program in chile because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild 34 relationships with humans a red fox on the porch of a house dead foxes in carbunup foxes are often considered pests or nuisance creatures for their opportunistic attacks on poultry and other small livestock fox attacks on humans are not common 35 many foxes adapt well to human environments with several species classified as resident urban carnivores for their ability to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries 36 foxes in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than foxes in non urban areas 36 urban foxes are ubiquitous in europe where they show altered behaviors compared to non urban foxes including increased population density smaller territory and pack foraging 37 foxes have been introduced in numerous locations with varying effects on indigenous flora and fauna 38 in some countries foxes are major predators of rabbits and hens population oscillations of these two species were the first nonlinear oscillation studied and led to the derivation of the lotka volterra equation 39 40 fox hunting main article fox hunting fox hunting originated in the united kingdom in the 16th century hunting with dogs is now banned in the united kingdom 41 42 43 44 though hunting without dogs is still permitted red foxes were introduced into australia in the early 19th century for sport and have since become widespread through much of the country they have caused population decline among many native species and prey on livestock especially new lambs 45 fox hunting is practiced as recreation in several other countries including canada france ireland italy russia united states and australia domestication a tame fox in talysarn wales see also domesticated silver fox and red fox taming and domestication there are many records of domesticated red foxes and others but rarely of sustained domestication a recent and notable exception is the russian silver fox 46 which resulted in visible and behavioral changes and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs the current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the soviet union and russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox this selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats dogs and other animals such as pigmentation changes floppy ears and curly tails 47 notably the new foxes became more tame allowing themselves to be petted whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers 48 attacks on humans main article animal attack in the united kingdom a number of cases of non fatal attacks on humans have been reported they often involved children or if there were gaps in homes through which foxes could pass 49 urban foxes see also red fox urban red foxes foxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban mostly suburban human environments their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection despite their larger size urban foxes have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environments 50 the san joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered species that has ironically become adapted to urban living in the san joaquin valley and salinas valley of southern california its diet includes mice ground squirrels rabbits hares bird eggs and insects and it has claimed habitats in open areas golf courses drainage basins and school grounds 50 in culture plate in the shape of two peaches depicting two foxes tang dynasty main article foxes in popular culture films and literature the fox appears in many cultures usually in folklore however there are slight variations in their depictions in western and persian folklore foxes are symbols of cunning and trickery a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters this is usually represented as a character possessing these traits these traits are used on a wide variety of characters either making them a nuisance to the story a misunderstood hero or a devious villain in asian folklore foxes are depicted as familiar spirits possessing magic powers similar to in western folklore foxes are portrayed as mischievous usually tricking other people with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human however there are other depictions of foxes as mystical sacred creatures that can either bring wonder or ruin 51 nine tailed foxes appear in chinese folklore literature and mythology in which depending on the tale they can be a good or a bad omen 52 the motif was eventually introduced from chinese to japanese and korean cultures 53 the constellation vulpecula represents a fox 54 notes cf west frisian foks dutch vos and german fuchs cf

subclass elasmobranchii infraclass euselachii superorder selachimorpha orders carcharhiniformes heterodontiformes hexanchiformes lamniformes orectolobiformes pristiophoriformes squaliformes squatiniformes synonyms pleurotremata selachii sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head modern sharks are classified within the clade selachimorpha or selachii and are the sister group to the rays however the term shark is also used to refer to extinct shark like members of the subclass elasmobranchii such as hybodonts that lie outside the modern group modern sharks first appeared and diversified during the jurassic period 1 since then sharks have diversified into over 500 species they range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark etmopterus perryi a deep sea species that is only 17 centimetres 6 7 in in length to the whale shark rhincodon typus the largest fish in the world which reaches approximately 12 metres 40 ft in length 2 sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths up to 2 000 metres 6 600 ft they generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can be found in both seawater and freshwater 3 sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth 4 several species are apex predators which are organisms that are at the top of their food chain select examples include the tiger shark blue shark great white shark mako shark thresher shark and hammerhead shark sharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup many shark populations are threatened by human activities since 1970 shark populations have been reduced by 71 mostly from overfishing 5 contents 1 etymology 2 evolutionary history 2 1

threats 11 conservation 12 see also 13 further reading 14 references etymology until the 16th century 6 sharks were known to mariners as sea dogs 7 this is still evidential in several species termed dogfish or the porbeagle the etymology of the word shark is uncertain the most likely etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of predator one who preys on others from the dutch schurk meaning villain scoundrel cf card shark loan shark etc which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour 8 a now disproven original research theory is that it derives from the yucatec maya word xook pronounced ʃoːk meaning shark 9 evidence for this etymology came from the oxford english dictionary which notes shark first came into use after sir john hawkins sailors exhibited one in london in 1569 and posted sharke to refer to the large sharks of the caribbean sea however the middle english dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word shark referring to a sea fish in a letter written by thomas beckington in 1442 which rules out a new world etymology 10 original research evolutionary history fossil shark tooth size over 9 cm or 3 5 inches with crown shoulder root and root lobe a collection of cretaceous shark teeth see also evolution of fish fossil record evidence for the existence of shark like chondrichthyans dates from the ordovician period 450 420 million years ago before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents 11 only scales have been recovered from the first supposed elasmobranchians and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans 12 the oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago in the silurian period 12 those animals looked very different from modern sharks 13 at this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident apparently to help catch fish the majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago 14 most fossils are of teeth often in large numbers partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime which explains the abundant fossils the teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate an apatite when a shark dies the decomposing skeleton breaks up scattering the apatite prisms preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments among the most ancient and primitive shark like fish is cladoselache from about 370 million years ago 13 which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio kentucky and tennessee at that point in earth s history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large shallow ocean which stretched across much of north america cladoselache was only about 1 metre 3 3 ft long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws 13 its teeth had several pointed cusps which wore down from use from the small number of teeth found together it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos the presence of whole fish arranged tail first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility most fossil shark like fish from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups the xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments 15 16 by the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago they had spread worldwide the other group the hybodonts appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans but also in freshwater citation needed the results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well preserved 325 million year old fossil suggested that sharks are not living fossils but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around 17 modern sharks belonging to selachimorpha first appeared and began diversifying during the jurassic with the appearance of most modern orders by the end of the period with diversification continuing until the end of the cretaceous 1 18 in the aftermath of the k pg extinction sharks became less abundant in the open ocean than ray finned fish which radiated subsequent to the event 19 early miocene extinction event see also miocene and list of extinction events a study published in 2021 provided evidence for a major shark extinction event that occurred 19 million years ago this is 5 million years before the established middle miocene disruption the cause of this extinction event is not yet known however the study suggests that pelagic shark diversity decreased by over 70 and abundance by over 90 and that modern sharks never recovered from this event the authors also state that prior to the extinction event sharks played a much larger role in the open ocean ecosystem than they do today in present times only 53 open ocean shark species remains 20 21 22 taxonomy elasmobranchii batoidea selachimorpha galeomorphii lamniformes carcharhiniformes orectolobiformes heterodontiformes squalomorphii squatiniformes pristiophoriformes squaliformes hexanchiformes phylogeny of living shark orders based on mitochondrial dna 23 shark fossil lebachacanthus senckenbergianus at permian period sharks belong to the superorder selachimorpha in the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes the elasmobranchii also include rays and skates the chondrichthyes also include chimaeras it was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks 24 but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids 25 26 the superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea or galeomorphii and squalea or squalomorphii the galeans are the heterodontiformes orectolobiformes lamniformes and carcharhiniformes lamnoids and carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade but recent studies show the lamnoids and orectoloboids are a clade some scientists now think that heterodontoids may be squalean the squaleans are divided into hexanchiformes and squalomorpha the former includes cow shark and frilled shark though some authors propose both families to be moved to separate orders the squalomorpha contains the squaliformes and the hypnosqualea the hypnosqualea may be invalid it includes the squatiniformes and the pristorajea which may also be invalid but includes the pristiophoriformes and the batoidea 24 27 there are more than 500 species of sharks split across thirteen orders including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct 27 28 carcharhiniformes commonly known as ground sharks the order includes the blue tiger bull grey reef blacktip reef caribbean reef blacktail reef whitetip reef and oceanic whitetip sharks collectively called the requiem sharks along with the houndsharks catsharks and hammerhead sharks they are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack heterodontiformes they are generally referred to as the bullhead or horn sharks hexanchiformes examples from this group include the cow sharks and frilled sharks which somewhat resembles a marine snake lamniformes they are commonly known as the mackerel sharks they include the goblin shark basking shark megamouth shark the thresher sharks shortfin and longfin mako sharks and great white shark they are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction the lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon otodus megalodon orectolobiformes they are commonly referred to as the carpet sharks including zebra sharks nurse sharks wobbegongs and the whale shark pristiophoriformes these are the sawsharks with an elongated toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey squaliformes this group includes the dogfish sharks and roughsharks squatiniformes also known as angel sharks they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to stingrays and skates echinorhiniformes this group includes the prickly shark and bramble shark phylogenetic placement of this group has been ambiguous in scientific studies 29 they are sometimes given their own order echinorhiniformes 28 cladoselachiformes hybodontiformes symmoriida xenacanthida xenacantiformes anatomy general anatomical features of sharks main article shark anatomy teeth main article shark tooth the teeth of tiger sharks are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw and are constantly replaced throughout life multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt some sharks lose 30 000 or more teeth in their lifetime the rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months in most species teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row which is observed in the cookiecutter shark 30 tooth shape depends on the shark s diet those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing those that feed on fish have needle like teeth for gripping and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting the teeth of plankton feeders such as the basking shark are small and non functional 31 skeleton shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates sharks and other cartilaginous fish skates and rays have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue cartilage is flexible and durable yet is about half the normal density of bone this reduces the skeleton s weight saving energy 32 because sharks do not have rib cages they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land 33 jaw the jaws of sharks like those of rays and skates are not attached to the cranium the jaw s surface in comparison to the shark s vertebrae and gill arches needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength it has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called tesserae which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic 34 this gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae but the jaws of large specimens such as the bull shark tiger shark and the great white shark have two to three layers or more depending on body size the jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers 32 in the rostrum snout the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts fins fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers 35 most sharks have eight fins sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail first direction 33 dermal denticles further information fish scale placoid scales the dermal denticles of a lemon shark viewed through a scanning electron microscope unlike bony fish sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body this works as an outer skeleton providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy 36 their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming 37 some species of shark have pigmented denticles that form complex patterns like spots e g zebra shark and stripes e g tiger shark these markings are important for camouflage and help sharks blend in with their environment as well as making them difficult for prey to detect 38 for some species dermal patterning returns to healed denticles even after they have been removed by injury 39 tails tails provide thrust making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species due to their evolution in separate environments sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion this is because the shark s vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish by contrast most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin 40 tiger sharks have a large upper lobe which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed the tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet whereas the porbeagle shark which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast swimming prey 41 other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly such as the thresher shark s usage of its powerful elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid physiology buoyancy unlike bony fish sharks do not have gas filled swim bladders for buoyancy instead sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene and their cartilage which is about half the normal density of bone 36 their liver constitutes up to 30 of their total body mass 42 the liver s effectiveness is limited so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs using it as a form of swim bladder bottom dwelling sharks like the nurse shark have negative buoyancy allowing them to rest on the ocean floor some sharks if inverted or stroked on the nose enter a natural state of tonic immobility researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely 43 respiration like other fish sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills unlike other fish shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind the head a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom dwelling sharks spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks 31 while the shark is moving water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as ram ventilation while at rest most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water a small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest these species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species 44 45 the respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark s two chambered heart here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries which come together to form the dorsal aorta the blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body the deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses from there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats 46 thermoregulation most sharks are cold blooded or more precisely poikilothermic meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment members of the family lamnidae such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water in these sharks a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile miraculous net the common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature 47 osmoregulation in contrast to bony fish with the exception of the coelacanth 48 the blood and other tissue of sharks and chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea up to 2 5 49 and trimethylamine n oxide tmao allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater this adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater and they are therefore confined to marine environments a few exceptions exist such as the bull shark which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea 42 when a shark dies the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia 50 51 research in 1930 by homer w smith showed that sharks urine doesn t contain sufficient sodium to avoid hypernatremia and it was postulated that there must be an additional mechanism for salt secretion in 1960 it was discovered at the mount desert island biological laboratory in salsbury cove maine that sharks have a type of salt gland located at the end of the intestine known as the rectal gland whose function is the secretion of chlorides 52 digestion digestion can take a long time the food moves from the mouth to a j shaped stomach where it is stored and initial digestion occurs 53 unwanted items may never get past the stomach and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth 54 one of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines this short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube like intestine the valve provides a long surface area requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca 53 fluorescence a few sharks appear fluorescent under blue light such as the swell shark and the chain catshark where the fluorophore derives from a metabolite of kynurenic acid 55 senses smell the shape of the hammerhead shark s head may enhance olfaction by spacing the nostrils further apart sharks have keen olfactory senses located in the short duct which is not fused unlike bony fish between the anterior and posterior nasal openings with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater 56 the size of the olfactory bulb varies across different shark species with size dependent on how much a given species relies on smell or vision to find their prey 57 in environments with low visibility shark species generally have larger olfactory bulbs 57 in reefs where visibility is high species of sharks from the family carcharhinidae have smaller olfactory bulbs 57 sharks found in deeper waters also have larger olfactory bulbs 58 sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril 59 this is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound they are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls some species such as nurse sharks have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey sight eye of a bigeyed sixgill shark hexanchus nakamurai shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates including similar lenses corneas and retinas though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum this tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters the effectiveness of the tissue varies with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils like humans something no teleost fish can do sharks have eyelids but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes to protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes this membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked however some species including the great white shark carcharodon carcharias do not have this membrane but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey the importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated some believe that electro and chemoreception are more significant while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important presumably the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant the use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions the shark s field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time 60 a micro spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind the remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and seeing only in shades of grey and green are believed to be effectively colorblind the study indicates that an object s contrast against the background rather than colour may be more important for object detection 61 62 63 hearing although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away 64 the hearing sensitivity for most shark species lies between 20 and 1000 hz 65 a small opening on each side of their heads not the spiracle leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel the lateral line shows a similar arrangement and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores this is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration and sound detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico lateralis system in bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost electromagnetic field receptors ampullae of lorenzini and motion detecting canals in the head of a shark electroreception main article electroreception the ampullae of lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs they number in the hundreds to thousands sharks use the ampullae of lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce 66 this helps sharks particularly the hammerhead shark find prey the shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation 67 lateral line main article lateral line this system is found in most fish including sharks it is a tactile sensory system which allows the organism to detect water speed and pressure changes near by 68 the main component of the system is the neuromast a cell similar to hair cells present in the vertebrate ear that interact with the surrounding aquatic environment this helps sharks distinguish between the currents around them obstacles off on their periphery and struggling prey out of visual view the shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 hz 69 life history the claspers of male spotted wobbegong shark egg the spiral egg case of a port jackson shark shark lifespans vary by species most live 20 to 30 years the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years 70 whale sharks rhincodon typus may also live over 100 years 71 earlier estimates suggested the greenland shark somniosus microcephalus could reach about 200 years but a recent study found that a 5 02 metre long 16 5 ft specimen was 392 120 years old i e at least 272 years old making it the longest lived vertebrate known 72 73 reproduction unlike most bony fish sharks are k selected reproducers meaning that they produce a small number of well developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle 74 sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish for example lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13 15 75 sexual sharks practice internal fertilization 76 the posterior part of a male shark s pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers analogous to a mammalian penis of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female 77 mating has rarely been observed in sharks 78 the smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female in less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female s oviduct females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating the bite marks may also come from courtship behavior the male may bite the female to show his interest in some species females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites 77 asexual there have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis 79 80 the details of this process are not well understood but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution ruling out sperm storage the extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare and probably a last ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity which helps build defenses against threats to the species species that rely solely on it risk extinction asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark s decline off the irish coast 81 brooding sharks display three ways to bear their young varying by species oviparity viviparity and ovoviviparity 82 83 ovoviviparity most sharks are ovoviviparous meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother s body and that the egg s yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos the young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct s fluids as in viviparity the young are born alive and fully functional lamniforme sharks practice oophagy where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs taking this a step further sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos the survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth the whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas including bays river mouths and shallow reefs they choose such areas for protection from predators mainly other sharks and the abundance of food dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark at 18 to 24 months basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods but accurate data are lacking 82 oviparity some species are oviparous laying their fertilized eggs in the water in most oviparous shark species an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo s these cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection the egg case is commonly called a mermaid s purse oviparous sharks include the horn shark catshark port jackson shark and swellshark 82 84 viviparity viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg and results in live birth 85 viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental 85 young are born fully formed and self sufficient 85 hammerheads the requiem sharks such as the bull and blue sharks and smoothhounds are viviparous 74 82 behavior the classic view describes a solitary hunter ranging the oceans in search of food however this applies to only a few species most live far more social sedentary benthic lives and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities 86 even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year 87 shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds with many sharks covering entire ocean basins sharks can be highly social remaining in large schools sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands e g in the gulf of california 42 cross species social hierarchies exist for example oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding 74 when approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display this usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements and can vary in intensity according to the threat level 88 speed in general sharks swim cruise at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour 5 0 mph but when feeding or attacking the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour 12 mph the shortfin mako shark the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour 31 mph 89 the great white shark is also capable of speed bursts these exceptions may be due to the warm blooded or homeothermic nature of these sharks physiology sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day 90 intelligence sharks possess brain to body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds 91 and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild 92 93 there is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment 94 sleep all sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe however not all species need to be moving to do this those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water it has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them 95 and as such they are not truly asleep species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming in which the shark is essentially unconscious it is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord rather than its brain coordinates swimming so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping and this also may be the case in larger shark species 95 in 2016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming 96 ecology feeding this section is about shark feeding for the sport of shark feeding see shark baiting most sharks are carnivorous 97 basking sharks whale sharks and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton basking sharks practice ram feeding whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean this type of feeding requires gill rakers long slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales the shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding 97 unlike many other sharks the great white shark is not actually an apex predator in all of its natural environments as it is sometimes hunted by orcas other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal s size the lower teeth are particularly sharp although they have never been observed feeding they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal twisting their bodies to rip off flesh 42 some seabed dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths 98 many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth other sharks feed on squid or fish which they swallow whole the viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact the great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth studded rostra many sharks including the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey these social sharks are often migratory traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools these migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources 99 range and habitat sharks are found in all seas they generally do not live in fresh water with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater 100 sharks are common down to depths of 2 000 metres 7 000 ft and some live even deeper but they are almost entirely absent below 3 000 metres 10 000 ft the deepest confirmed report of a shark is a portuguese dogfish at 3 700 metres 12 100 ft 101 relationship with humans attacks a sign warning about the presence of sharks in salt rock south africa snorkeler swims near a blacktip reef shark in rare circumstances involving poor visibility blacktips may bite a human mistaking it for prey under normal conditions they are harmless and shy main article shark attack in 2006 the international shark attack file isaf undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks the average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4 3 102 contrary to popular belief only a few sharks are dangerous to humans out of more than 470 species only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans the great white oceanic whitetip tiger and bull sharks 103 104 these sharks are large powerful predators and may sometimes attack and kill people despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage 105 the perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks such as the jersey shore shark attacks of 1916 and through popular fictional works about shark attacks such as the jaws film series jaws author peter benchley as well as jaws director steven spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man eating monsters 106 to help avoid an unprovoked attack humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much 107 in general sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey such as seals 108 109 in captivity main article sharks in captivity until recently only a few benthic species of shark such as hornsharks leopard sharks and catsharks had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more this gave rise to the belief that sharks as well as being difficult to capture and transport were difficult to care for more knowledge has led to more species including the large pelagic sharks living far longer in captivity along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation 110 the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until september 2004 when the monterey bay aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her a whale shark in georgia aquarium most species are not suitable for home aquaria and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria 111 uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria 111 public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing some owners have been tempted to release them 111 species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet 90 cm and can live up to 25 years 111 in culture shark themed nose art made popular by the flying tigers pictured is commonly seen on military aircraft in hawaii sharks figure prominently in hawaiian mythology stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form a common theme was that a shark man would warn beach goers of sharks in the waters the beach goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark man who warned them hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods among a fishing people the most popular of all aumakua or deified ancestor guardians are shark aumakua kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark the body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe struck family to the markings on the shark s body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved s body had been wrapped such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet receiving food and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies the ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery many native hawaiian families claim such an aumakua who is known by name to the whole community 112 kamohoali i is the best known and revered of the shark gods he was the older and favored brother of pele 113 and helped and journeyed with her to hawaii he was able to assume all human and fish forms a summit cliff on the crater of kilauea is one of his most sacred spots at one point he had a heiau temple or shrine dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of molokai kamohoali i was an ancestral god not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself 114 115 in fijian mythology dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls in american samoa on the island of tutuila in american samoa a u s territory there is a location called turtle and shark laumei ma malie which is important in samoan culture the location is the site of a legend called o le tala i le laumei ma le malie in which two humans are said to have transformed into a turtle and a shark 116 117 118 according to the u s national park service villagers from nearby vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at turtle and shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call 116 in popular culture main article sharks in popular culture in contrast to the complex portrayals by hawaiians and other pacific islanders the european and western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence 119 sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines notably in the jaws novel and the film of the same name along with its sequels 120 sharks are threats in other films such as deep blue sea the reef and others although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in finding nemo and the austin powers series sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean such examples include the tom and jerry cartoons jabberjaw and other shows produced by hanna barbera they also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters citation needed popular misconceptions a popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer but this is not scientifically supported sharks have been known to get cancer 121 122 both diseases and parasites affect sharks the evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few if any scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease 123 other apparently false claims are that fins prevent cancer 124 and treat osteoarthritis 125 no scientific proof supports these claims at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment 126 threats to sharks further information list of threatened sharks and shark sanctuary the annual shark catch has increased rapidly over the last 60 years the value of shark fins for shark fin soup has led to an increase in shark catches where usually only the fins are taken while the rest of the shark is discarded typically into the sea health concerns about bmaa in the fins now exists regarding consumption of the soup a 4 3 metre 14 ft 540 kilogram 1 200 lb tiger shark caught in kāne ohe bay oahu in 1966 fishery in 2008 it was estimated that nearly 100 million sharks were being killed by people every year due to commercial and recreational fishing 127 128 in 2021 it was estimated that the population of oceanic sharks and rays had dropped by 71 over the previous half century 5 shark finning yields are estimated at 1 44 million metric tons 1 59 million short tons for 2000 and 1 41 million metric tons 1 55 million short tons for 2010 based on an analysis of average shark weights this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000 and about 97 million sharks in 2010 with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year 129 130 sharks are a common seafood in many places including japan and australia in the australian state of victoria shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips citation needed in which fillets are battered and deep fried or crumbed and grilled in fish and chip shops shark is called flake in india small sharks or baby sharks called sora in tamil language telugu language are sold in local markets since the flesh is not developed cooking the flesh breaks it into powder which is then fried in oil and spices called sora puttu sora poratu the soft bones can be easily chewed they are considered a delicacy in coastal tamil nadu icelanders ferment greenland sharks to produce a delicacy called hákarl 131 during a four year period from 1996 to 2000 an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets 132 sharks are often killed for shark fin soup fishermen capture live sharks fin them and dump the finless animal back into the water shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade 128 the resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators 133 shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world fins sell for about 300 lb in 2009 134 poachers illegally fin millions each year few governments enforce laws that protect them 130 in 2010 hawaii became the first u s state to prohibit the possession sale trade or distribution of shark fins 135 from 1996 to 2000 an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins 132 it is estimated by traffic that over 14 000 tonnes of shark fins were exported into singapore between 2005 2007 and 2012 2014 136 shark fin soup is a status symbol in asian countries and is erroneously considered healthy and full of nutrients scientific research has revealed however that high concentrations of bmaa are present in shark fins 137 because bmaa is a neurotoxin consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills therefore may pose a health risk 138 bmaa is under study for its pathological role in neurodegegerative diseases such as als alzheimer s disease and parkinson s disease sharks are also killed for meat european diners consume dogfishes smoothhounds catsharks makos porbeagle and also skates and rays 139 however the u s fda lists sharks as one of four fish with swordfish king mackerel and tilefish whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women sharks generally reach sexual maturity only after many years and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish harvesting sharks before they reproduce severely impacts future populations capture induced premature birth and abortion collectively called capture induced parturition occurs frequently in sharks rays when fished 76 capture induced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12 of live bearing sharks and rays 88 species to date 76 the majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management the rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries 43 major declines in shark stocks have been recorded some species have been depleted by over 90 over the past 20 30 years with population declines of 70 not unusual 140 a study by the international union for conservation of nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered 141 142 shark culling main article shark culling in 2014 a shark cull in western australia killed dozens of sharks mostly tiger sharks using drum lines 143 until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the western australia epa from 2014 to 2017 there was an imminent threat policy in western australia in which sharks that threatened humans in the ocean were shot and killed 144 this imminent threat policy was criticized by senator rachel siewart for killing endangered sharks 145 the imminent threat policy was cancelled in march 2017 146 in august 2018 the western australia government announced a plan to re introduce drum lines though this time the drum lines are smart drum lines 147 from 1962 to the present 148 the government of queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines under a shark control program this program has also inadvertently killed large numbers of other animals such as dolphins it has also killed endangered hammerhead sharks 149 150 151 152 queensland s drum line program has been called outdated cruel and ineffective 152 from 2001 to 2018 a total of 10 480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in queensland including in the great barrier reef 153 from 1962 to 2018 roughly 50 000 sharks were killed by queensland authorities 154 the government of new south wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets 151 155 the current net program in new south wales has been described as being extremely destructive to marine life including sharks 156 between 1950 and 2008 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in new south wales also during this period a total of 15 135 marine animals were killed in the nets including dolphins whales turtles dugongs and critically endangered grey nurse sharks 157 there has been a very large decrease in the number of sharks in eastern australia and the shark killing programs in queensland and new south wales are partly responsible for this decrease 154 kwazulu natal an area of south africa has a shark killing program using nets and drum lines these nets and drum lines have killed turtles and dolphins and have been criticized for killing wildlife 158 during a 30 year period more than 33 000 sharks have been killed in kwazulu natal s shark killing program during the same 30 year period 2 211 turtles 8 448 rays and 2 310 dolphins were killed in kwazulu natal 158 authorities on the french island of réunion kill about 100 sharks per year 159 killing sharks negatively affects the marine ecosystem 160 161 jessica morris of humane society international calls shark culling a knee jerk reaction and says sharks are top order predators that play an important role in the functioning of marine ecosystems we need them for healthy oceans 162 george h burgess the former 163 director of the international shark attack file describes shark culling as a form of revenge satisfying a public demand for blood and little else 164 he also said shark culling is a retro type move reminiscent of what people would have done in the 1940s and 50s back when we didn t have an ecological conscience and before we knew the consequences of our actions 164 jane williamson an associate professor in marine ecology at macquarie university says there is no scientific support for the concept that culling sharks in a particular area will lead to a decrease in shark attacks and increase ocean safety 165 other threats other threats include habitat alteration damage and loss from coastal development pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species 166 the 2007 documentary sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction 167 conservation further information list of threatened sharks and shark sanctuary in 1991 south africa was the first country in the world to declare great white sharks a legally protected species 168 however the kwazulu natal sharks board is allowed to kill great white sharks in its shark control program in eastern south africa 158 intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea the united states congress passed the shark finning prohibition act in 2000 169 two years later the act saw its first legal challenge in united states v approximately 64 695 pounds of shark fins in 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas 170 seeking to close the loophole the shark conservation act was passed by congress in december 2010 and it was signed into law in january 2011 171 172 in 2003 the european union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states 173 this prohibition was amended in june 2013 to close remaining loopholes 174 in 2009 the international union for conservation of nature s iucn red list of endangered species named 64 species one third of all oceanic shark species as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning 175 176 in 2010 the convention on international trade in endangered species cites rejected proposals from the united states and palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks the majority but not the required two thirds of voting delegates approved the proposal china by far the world s largest shark market and japan which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species led the opposition 177 178 in march 2013 three endangered commercially valuable sharks the hammerheads the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix 2 of cites bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation 179 in 2010 greenpeace international added the school shark shortfin mako shark mackerel shark tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries 180 advocacy group shark trust campaigns to limit shark fishing advocacy group seafood watch directs american consumers to not eat sharks 181 under the auspices of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals cms also known as the bonn convention the memorandum of understanding on the conservation of migratory sharks was concluded and came into effect in march 2010 it was the first global instrument concluded under cms and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection conservation and management of migratory sharks through multilateral intergovernmental discussion and scientific research in july 2013 new york state a major market and entry point for shark fins banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the united states and the three pacific u s territories in providing legal protection to sharks 182 in the united states as of january 16 2019 12 states massachusetts maryland delaware california illinois hawaii oregon nevada rhode island washington new york and texas along with three u s territories american samoa guam and the northern mariana islands have passed laws against the sale or possession of shark fins 183 184 several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing these regions include american samoa the bahamas the cook islands french polynesia guam the maldives the marshall islands micronesia the northern mariana islands and palau 185 186 187 in april 2020 researchers reported to have traced the origins of shark fins of endangered hammerhead sharks from a retail market in hong kong back to their source populations and therefore the approximate locations where the sharks were first caught using dna analysis 188 189 in july 2020 scientists reported results of a survey of 371 reefs in 58 nations estimating the conservation status of reef sharks globally no sharks have been observed on almost 20 of the surveyed reefs and shark depletion was strongly associated with both socio economic conditions and conservation measures 190 191 sharks are considered to be a vital part of the ocean ecosystem according to a 2021 study in nature 192 overfishing has resulted in a 71 global decline in the number of oceanic sharks and rays over the preceding 50 years the oceanic whitetip and both the scalloped hammerhead and great hammerheads are now classified as critically endangered 193 sharks in tropical waters have declined more rapidly than those in temperate zones during the period studied 194 a 2021 study published in current biology

strength cera kesh telekinesis the emerald empress is the name of several fictional super villains appearing american comic books published by dc comics the characters associated with the name name are often portrayed as a prominent adversary of the legion of super heroes the first incarnation of the character appeared in adventure comics 352 january 1967 1 the first and mainstream version of the character is sarya of venegar whom discovered the emerald eye of ekron and was corrupted by the artifact awakening the evil dormant within the young woman and making her a conqueror sarya turned to a life of piracy and began to gain a following before later founding the fatal five and becoming an enemy of the legion of super heroes the second incarnation of the character cera kesh is instead portrayed as a teenaged fan of the legion of super heroes whom auditioned to be a part of the team only to be turned away and mocked for her overweight and unattractive appearance sensing her anger and jealousy the emerald eye of ekron corrupts her into the second emerald empress granting her both powers and the ability to become an idealized version of herself the third incarnation of the character falyce is a native of the planet orando and victim of the planet s duke wishing for the power to slay her torturer the emerald eye of ekron makes the third emerald empress but drives her insane versions of the emerald empress has been adapted the sarya incarnation having appeared in justice league unlimited as part of the dc animated universe sarya also appeared in the legion of super heroes animated series voiced by jennifer hale in season one and tara strong in later seasons in the latter series an original incarnation also appeared in the young justice animated series featuring

the menace of the sun eater once the sun eater was defeated she joined the fatal five with tharok validus mano and the persuader 2 the empress had no innate super powers rather she employed a powerful mystical item called the emerald eye of ekron an approximately 2 diameter sphere that obeyed her mental commands 3 the eye could fly and emit blasts of energy and allowed the empress to fly as well as survive in space the eye s residual energy also gave her on at least one occasion super strength it caused her to grow to gigantic stature during one battle the eye could also reform itself if shattered the eye is an item of immense power it defeated superboy who is susceptible to magic generally more than once though it seemed to have more trouble with mon el perhaps because he was immune to green kryptonite and its blasts may have contained elements of it despite this for unknown reasons the eye does not like green kryptonite and being exposed to a chunk of it has made the eye flee on more than one occasion leaving the empress behind temporarily the emerald empress died when at her request legionnaire sensor girl used her powers of illusion to mask sarya s presence from the emerald eye of ekron as the empress body quickly withered and decomposed she expressed relief to be free from the eye s control indicating both that their symbiotic relationship was unwilling and that the empress was far older than she appeared 4 final crisis edit during final crisis the emerald empress alongside the other fatal five members was among the supervillains in superboy prime s legion of super villains dc rebirth edit the emerald empress appears as one of max lord s super villains in justice league vs suicide squad during dc rebirth empress was part of the first suicide squad along with lobo johnny sorrow rustam and doctor polaris the empress was manipulated by amanda waller by potential information about saturn girl when the first mission ended in disaster empress and the others were imprisoned they were later freed by maxwell as part of his own plan for domination empress escaped this multi layered plan with her eye severely damaged this endangered her plan to stay in the current time realizing she might need help she pondered recruiting four other allies 5 cera kesh edit cera kesh first appears in legionnaires 2 slightly overweight and with poor skin she was also telekinetic and sought to join the legion through their open audition program mocked by legion member inferno for whom she harbored an infatuation for her appearance kesh fled in embarrassment and anger and was found by the emerald eye transformed by it into an idealized version of herself and with all the powers of the eye boosting her own she succumbed to the eye s influence and turned to a life of crime with the other members of the fatal five at the same time leland mccauley found a second emerald eye with which he hoped to turn ingria olav into the new emerald empress instead cera killed her and gained the power of both eyes she was not seen again as the timeline she was a part of ended shortly thereafter falyce edit in legion of super heroes vol 6 annual 1 2011 the eye finds a new empress on the planet of orando this young girl fights shrinking violet light lass sun boy sensor girl and gates of the legion before being defeated by violet the girl was released from the eye s control but the eye itself managed to flee the planet emerald eye of ekron edit starfire wielding the emerald eye in 52 52 origin edit according to the year spanning maxiseries 52 2006 the eye was once a real eye for the cosmic entity called ekron 6 but somehow emerald empress got the eye and got it to work for her 7 8 in the present the emerald eye has appeared in the pages of 52 in the possession of lobo and in the brave and the bold back in the hands of the emerald empress lobo kept the item in a small chest under his supervision unwilling to use its powers when starfire used the eye to save the population of sector 3500 from a swarm of strange creatures lobo revealed that he knew something about the origins of the eye an emerald head of ekron also existed and was searching for its lost eyeball ekron is apparently a member of the green lantern corps but has been driven insane by the destruction of the space sector under his protection by lady styx the emerald eye itself is later revealed as a precursor of the technology that later led to the power ring worn by all green lanterns with less functionality but nevertheless a formidable weapon other origins edit when the eye was reintroduced in the legion of super heroes vol 6 annual of 2011 none of this was acknowledged rather ekron was referred to as a world where the eye had once been worshipped as a god the 52 explanation also neglects any existence of the eye wielded by garryn bek of l e g i o n in the 21st century powers and abilities edit standalone abilities edit the first incarnation of the emerald empress sarya possessed limited independent abilities possessing greater than average human strength a trait possessed by inhabitants of venagar much of her abilities are centered upon the emerald eye of ekron in which she controls through her own mind and willpower having a symbiotic relationship with the artifact she draws power from it while the eye draws focus and both are more powerful the closer they are 9 10 cera kesh the second incarnation of the emerald empress possessed telekinesis powers through the emerald eye of ekron edit each user of the emerald eye of ekron gains access to its nearly unlimited levels of emerald willpower energies the same power source used by the green lantern corps making the artifact both indestructible and considered uncontainable due to its usage of the same willpower emerald energy sources it is considered related to the oan s power battery used by the green lantern corps 9 10 its powers include granting its users the ability to fly and survive in the vacuum of space generate protective force fields project blasts strong enough to hurt kryptonians create energy constructs hypnotize others and teleport over short distances it can also grant superhuman strength size manipulation cast illusions alter reality see through every spectrum and wavelength instantly reform itself if shattered enhance any innate skills that its current user has and keep its user young and beautiful other versions edit ingria olav edit ingria olav was a short lived emerald empress who was the girlfriend of legion of super heroes foe leland mccauley iv having discovered the second eye of ekron he recreated a fatal five team with ingria serving as the team s new emerald empress however ingria proved to be more cowardly and an unskilled user of the eye of ekron being unable to stomach the life of a super villainess she is later tracked down by cera kesh the other emerald empress and is vaporized by the woman whom then takes the second eye of ekron for herself the empress post zero hour edit after the zero hour event and the subsequent reboot of the legion s continuity a character simply called the empress appeared unconnected to the emerald eye of ekron which appeared separately later although she had no powers she was as dangerous as the rest of the fatal five being a sadistic murderess who had taught herself how to kill any known lifeform the eye itself was in possession of the supervillain scavenger but was discovered by shrinking violet who fell under its control with the legion s help violet managed to break the eye s hold on her but not before she had sent half the team into the past and attracted the attention of the ancient sorcerer mordru eventually the eye came into the hands of the empress the empress seemed to have broken the eye s will leaving her unequivocally in control this version of the legion is still in continuity but now established as taking place on a parallel world which means that this eye is not the same as the one the original legion encountered but the eye of an alternate universe reception edit emerald empress was ranked 38th in comics buyer s guide s 100 sexiest women in comics list 11 russ burlingame of comicbook com described her as a big player in the dc universe of late and that she s one of the most identifiable legion villains with a cool gimmick and a great visual noting her appearance in justice league vs suicide squad and in a story that crossed supergirl over with batgirl 12 in other media edit television edit the cara kesh version of emerald empress appeared in the episode far from home of justice league unlimited voiced by joanne whalley 13 in that episode the eye s power proved to be stronger than a green lantern power ring emerald empress from the legion of super heroes the sarya version of emerald empress appears in legion of super heroes voiced by jennifer hale in season one and tara strong from then on as in the comics the emerald eye of ekron is the source of her mystic powers some clues to this version s relationship with the eye can be observed in the first season finale sundown she had been separated from it for some time during her imprisonment and hugged it when it was returned to her suffered no physical effects when shrinking violet damaged its circuitry from within once the fatal five betrayed the legion nor when matter eater lad took a bite out of it in the season two premiere though its destruction has left her powerless biting into it damaged matter eater lad s mind leaving him in a near comatose state for most of the season though not appearing in batman the brave and the bold the emerald empress is referenced in the super batman of planet x batman mentions to green arrow that the space pirates they are chasing are stealing the emerald eye of ekron in young justice ursa zod became the emerald empress in the 21st century when she was chosen by the emerald eye of ekron which had been stolen from the vault of the new god metron by her future son lor zod unlike other versions the emerald eye of ekron is considered a magical artifact instead of oan technology 14 film edit a version of emerald empress made a cameo appearance with the other villains in justice league the new frontier a version of emerald empress appears as the main antagonist in justice league vs the fatal five voiced by sumalee montano 15 in this version she is mano s lover she and validus were sent back into the 21st century to be imprisoned on oa since the green lanterns no longer existed to hold criminals of their power she and validus are freed by mano and conceives a plan to rid the future of all their enemies by having the eye of ekron drain the energy of the green lantern central battery and use it to destroy earth s sun this would wipe out the justice league the martians the legion of super heroes and the united planets leaving no one to oppose them in the 31st century green lantern jessica cruz defeats her by throwing mano in her direction causing his burning touch to badly disfigure her face and then buries the gang alive by bringing an entire mountain down on them references edit wells

statistics cookie statemention wikipedia ion from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search particle atom or molecule with a net electrical charge for other uses see ion disambiguation an ion ˈaɪ ɒn ən 1 is an atom or molecule with a net electrical charge the charge of an electron is considered to be negative by convention and this charge is equal and opposite to the charge of a proton which is considered to be positive by convention the net charge of an ion is not zero because its total number of electrons is unequal to its total number of protons a cation is a positively charged ion with fewer electrons than protons 2 while an anion is a negatively charged ion with more electrons than protons 3 opposite electric charges are pulled towards one another by electrostatic force so cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or monatomic ions while two or more atoms form molecular ions or polyatomic ions in the case of physical ionization in a fluid gas or liquid ion pairs are created by spontaneous molecule collisions where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion 4 ions are also created by chemical interactions such as the dissolution of a salt in liquids or by other means such as passing a direct current through a conducting solution dissolving an anode via ionization contents 1 history of discovery 2 characteristics 2 1 anions and cations 2 2 natural occurrences 3 related technology 3 1 detection of ionizing radiation 4 chemistry 4 1 denoting the charged state 4 2 sub classes 4 3 formation 4 3 1 formation of monatomic ions 4 3 2 formation of polyatomic and molecular ions 4 3 3 ionization potential 4 4 ionic bonding 4 5 common ions 5 see also 6 references history of discovery the word ion was coined from greek neuter present participle of ienai greek ἰέναι meaning to go a cation is something that moves down greek κάτω pronounced kato meaning down and an anion is something that moves up greek ano ἄνω meaning up they are so called because ions move toward the electrode of opposite charge this term was introduced after a suggestion by the english polymath william whewell 5 by english physicist and chemist michael faraday in 1834 for the then unknown species that goes from one electrode to the other through an aqueous medium 6 7 faraday did not know the nature of these species but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode that some kind of substance has moved through the solution in a current this conveys matter from one place to the other in correspondence with faraday whewell also coined the words anode and cathode as well as anion and cation as ions that are attracted to the respective electrodes 5 svante arrhenius put forth in his 1884 dissertation the explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts dissociate into paired charged particles when dissolved for which he would win the 1903 nobel prize in chemistry 8 arrhenius explanation was that in forming a solution the salt dissociates into faraday s ions he proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current 9 10 11 characteristics ions in their gas like state are highly reactive and will rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents for example water to produce solvated ions which are more stable for reasons involving a combination of energy and entropy changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid these stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures a common example is the ions present in seawater which are derived from dissolved salts as charged objects ions are attracted to opposite electric charges positive to negative and vice versa and repelled by like charges when they move their trajectories can be deflected by a magnetic field electrons due to their smaller mass and thus larger space filling properties as matter waves determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all thus anions negatively charged ions are larger than the parent molecule or atom as the excess electron s repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion because its size is determined by its electron cloud cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud one particular cation that of hydrogen contains no electrons and thus consists of a single proton much smaller than the parent hydrogen atom anions and cations anion redirects here not to be confused with the quasiparticle anyon hydrogen atom center contains a single proton and a single electron removal of the electron gives a cation left whereas the addition of an electron gives an anion right the hydrogen anion with its loosely held two electron cloud has a larger radius than the neutral atom which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the cation hydrogen forms the only charge 1 cation that has no electrons but even cations that unlike hydrogen retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons an anion ˈænˌaɪ ən ann eye ən from the greek word ἄνω ánō meaning up 12 is an ion with more electrons than protons giving it a net negative charge since electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged 13 a cation ˈkætˌaɪ ən kat eye ən from the greek word κάτω káto meaning down 14 is an ion with fewer electrons than protons giving it a positive charge 15 there are additional names used for ions with multiple charges for example an ion with a 2 charge is known as a dianion and an ion with a 2 charge is known as a dication a zwitterion is a neutral molecule with positive and negative charges at different locations within that molecule 16 cations and anions are measured by their ionic radius and they differ in relative size cations are small most of them less than 10 10 m 10 8 cm in radius but most anions are large as is the most common earth anion oxygen from this fact it is apparent that most of the space of a crystal is occupied by the anion and that the cations fit into the spaces between them 17 the terms anion and cation for ions that respectively travel to the anode and cathode during electrolysis were introduced by michael faraday in 1834 following his consultation with william whewell natural occurrences further information list of oxidation states of the elements ions are ubiquitous in nature and are responsible for diverse phenomena from the luminescence of the sun to the existence of the earth s ionosphere atoms in their ionic state may have a different color from neutral atoms and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the color of gemstones in both inorganic and organic chemistry including biochemistry the interaction of water and ions is extremely important citation needed an example is energy that drives the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate atp clarification needed the following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently these are arranged in decreasing physical length scale from the astronomical to the microscopic related technology ions can be non chemically prepared using various ion sources usually involving high voltage or temperature these are used in a multitude of devices such as mass spectrometers optical emission spectrometers particle accelerators ion implanters and ion engines as reactive charged particles they are also used in air purification by disrupting microbes and in household items such as smoke detectors as signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across membranes the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death this is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial biocides including the ion channels gramicidin and amphotericin a fungicide inorganic dissolved ions are a component of total dissolved solids a widely known indicator of water quality detection of ionizing radiation schematic of an ion chamber showing drift of ions electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass 4 avalanche effect between two electrodes the original ionization event liberates one electron and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron so two electrons emerge from each collision the ionizing electron and the liberated electron the ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as alpha beta gamma and x rays the original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an ion pair a positive ion and a free electron by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules the ionization chamber is the simplest of these detectors and collects all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas through the application of an electric field 4 the geiger müller tube and the proportional counter both use a phenomenon known as a townsend avalanche to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact chemistry denoting the charged state equivalent notations for an iron atom fe that lost two electrons referred to as ferrous when writing the chemical formula for an ion its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule atom the net charge is written with the magnitude before the sign that is a doubly charged cation is indicated as 2 instead of 2 however the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules atoms for example the sodium cation is indicated as na and not na1 an alternative and acceptable way of showing a molecule atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times this is often seen with transition metals chemists sometimes circle the sign this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning all three representations of fe2 fe and fe shown in the figure are thus equivalent mixed roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion the oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted roman numerals whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with roman numerals particularly in spectroscopy for example the fe2 example seen above is referred to as fe ii or feii the roman numeral designates the formal oxidation state of an element whereas the superscripted indo arabic numerals denote the net charge the two notations are therefore exchangeable for monatomic ions but the roman numerals cannot be applied to polyatomic ions however it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex as shown by the uranyl ion example sub classes if an ion contains unpaired electrons it is called a radical ion just like uncharged radicals radical ions are very reactive polyatomic ions containing oxygen such as carbonate and sulfate are called oxyanions molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called organic ions if the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon it is termed a carbocation if positively charged or carbanion if negatively charged formation formation of monatomic ions monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the valence shell the outer most electron shell in an atom the inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged atomic nucleus and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction the process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ionization atoms can be ionized by bombardment with radiation but the more usual process of ionization encountered in chemistry is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules this transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable closed shell electronic configurations atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy for example a sodium atom na has a single electron in its valence shell surrounding 2 stable filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons since these filled shells are very stable a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration becoming a sodium cation in the process na na e displaystyle ce na na e on the other hand a chlorine atom cl has 7 electrons in its valence shell which is one short of the stable filled shell with 8 electrons thus a chlorine atom tends to gain an extra electron and attain a stable 8 electron configuration becoming a chloride anion in the process cl e cl displaystyle ce cl e cl this driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction wherein the extra electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine forming sodium cations and chloride anions being oppositely charged these cations and anions form ionic bonds and combine to form sodium chloride nacl more commonly known as table salt na cl nacl displaystyle ce na cl nacl formation of polyatomic and molecular ions an electrostatic potential map of the nitrate ion 2no 3 the 3 dimensional shell represents a single arbitrary isopotential polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton h in neutral molecules for example when ammonia nh3 accepts a proton h a process called protonation it forms the ammonium ion nh 4 ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same electronic configuration but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge forming the ion nh 3 however this ion is unstable because it has an incomplete valence shell around the nitrogen atom making it a very reactive radical ion due to the instability of radical ions polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as h rather than gaining or losing electrons this allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge ionization potential main article ionization potential the energy required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ionization potential or ionization energy the nth ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its nth electron after the first n 1 electrons have already been detached each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last particularly great increases occur after any given block of atomic orbitals is exhausted of electrons for this reason ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks for example sodium has one valence electron in its outermost shell so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron as na on the other side of the periodic table chlorine has seven valence electrons so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron as cl caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest 18 in general the ionization energy of metals is much lower than the ionization energy of nonmetals which is why in general metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions ionic bonding main article ionic bond ionic bonding is a kind of chemical bonding that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions ions of like charge repel each other and ions of opposite charge attract each other therefore ions do not usually exist on their own but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a crystal lattice the resulting compound is called an ionic compound and is said to be held together by ionic bonding in ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the ionic radius of individual ions may be derived the most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals except noble gases which rarely form chemical compounds metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable closed shell electronic configuration as such they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration this property is known as electropositivity non metals on the other hand are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration as such they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration this tendency is known as electronegativity when a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron deficient nonmetal atoms this reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions which are attracted to each other to form a salt common ions common cations 19 common name formula historic name monatomic

comics created by editor julius schwartz writer john broome and artist carmine infantino once a minor character in the dc comics canon he occupies an almost unique position in dc comics history as a superhero who was created between the two great superhero comics periods the golden age and the silver age his early stories fall into a no man s land sometimes referred to as the atomic age because of the recurrent science fiction themes of most comics of the period when very few superheroes comics were published and fewer than 12 short lived superhero characters were introduced along with marvel comics namor the sub mariner and toro sidekick of the original human torch he is among the first mutant metahuman superheroes meaning he was born with his powers predating x men by 12 years

page tale the origin of captain comet in the flagship science fiction title strange adventures 9 june 1951 published by national comics now known as dc comics 1 he was created by strange adventures editor julius schwartz 2 john broome and artist carmine infantino and the story was written by john broome under the alias edgar ray merritt drawn by carmine infantino and inked by bernard sachs the character was based on the pulp fiction character captain future 3 4 his first appearance was actually a two part story continued in the air bandits from space in strange adventures 10 july 1951 from issue 12 september 1951 murphy anderson took over as artist and he drew all captain comet s further appearances in strange adventures until 46 july 1954 5 sy barry and gil kane drew the last two stories john broome wrote every issue captain comet appeared in 38 issues of strange adventures missing only issues 45 47 and 48 and ending in strange adventures 49 october 1954 from the beginning captain comet appeared on most of the covers mainly drawn by murphy anderson or gil kane stories ranged in length from six to 10 pages dropping from 10 pages in 1951 to eight pages in 1952 and finally six pages from may 1953 he next appeared in 1976 when writer gerry conway and co writer david anthony kraft reintroduced him as a supporting character in secret society of super villains starting with no man shall call me master secret society of super villains 2 july august 1976 he appeared in most issues of that title together with the associated secret society of super villains special 1 october 1977 until it was cancelled with issue 15 june july 1978 during this run he also appeared in super team family giant 13 september 1977 a story directly linked to the secret society of super villains series and as lead character for the first time since 1954 in an extended story danger dinosaurs at large in dc special 27 april may 1977 by bob rozakis and artist rich buckler secret society of super villains was cancelled as part of the dc implosion captain comet was a popular character at the time he came second in a poll for potential justice league membership and writer bob rozakis presented dc comics with a proposal for captain comet s first self titled series 6 7 after the cancellation of secret society of super villains captain comet entered another hiatus his appearances limited to guest spots in other dc titles during the 1980s four of these were cameo appearances crisis on infinite earths 5 august 1985 10 january 1986 and 12 march 1986 and all star squadron 53 january 1986 two were team ups with superman dc comics presents 22 june 1980 and 91 march 1986 the fourth was a retelling of his origin by roy thomas in secret origins vol 2 annual 1 1987 he also appeared in the non canonical series dc challenge 1986 he then became a supporting character in the l e g i o n series from issue 16 june 1990 captain comet was actually a late replacement for fellow 1950s space traveler adam strange who was due to become a regular character as otherwise it would have clashed with the adam strange limited series published around the same time 8 he was then part of the r e b e l s series which continued from l e g i o n that series was cancelled with r e b e l s 96 17 march 1996 and he had a solo story in showcase 96 10 november 1996 after which another hiatus followed in 2005 under the writer jim starlin captain comet had his highest profile in dc comics publications since the 1950s featuring in the rann thanagar war miniseries 2005 starring in the eight issue miniseries mystery in space vol 2 2006 9 and co starring in rann thanagar holy war 2008 and strange adventures vol 3 2009 as well as appearing briefly in the 52 2006 and final crisis 2008 events following that he became a regular character in the ongoing r e b e l s series 2009 in 2011 a revamped version of captain comet renamed simply comet featured in grant morrison s run on action comics fictional character biography edit strange adventures 9 art by carmine infantino 1950s strange adventures edit captain comet the first man of the future is a mutant metahuman born a hundred thousand years before his time in 1931 to john and martha blake a farming couple from the american midwest 10 his metagene was triggered by a comet passing overhead at birth 11 adam blake discovered his unique abilities as he grew up at the age of four he instantly found a ring his mother had lost i just knew it was there and by eight years old demonstrated photographic memory by rapidly reading a whole encyclopedia and retaining the information other skills manifested almost instantly he could play musical instruments without training and was secretly expert at sports to olympic record level in high school he saved a schoolmate from falling to her death by mental force but despite his powers he felt isolated from other humans because of his differences from them after leaving school he became a librarian in midwest city where he sought the help of a renowned physicist professor emery zackro who tested him and discovered adam was a mutant postulating he was the reverse of an evolutionary throwback an accidental specimen of future man 12 a his captain comet persona began when adam used his powers to intervene when criminals attempted to steal an advanced scientific device invented by professor zackro immediately after this blake and the professor agreed blake should become a superhero on a full time basis and he made his first appearance in public as captain comet combating giant terraforming robot tops belonging to an alien race looking for a world to colonize during this task adam built a working version of a prototype spaceship professor zackro had designed which would become his personal spaceship the cometeer and took up a costume spacesuit and stun gun also invented by the professor 12 b over the next three years he saved earth from multiple alien invasions and explored space in the cometeer saving other civilizations and meeting beautiful alien damsels in distress during this period he largely used intelligence and his mind reading skills to help solve problems seldom resorting to physical solutions among his weirder adventures captain comet battled mad greek gods from space 13 fought dinosaurs and alien creatures and came up against an evil super powered ape several times 14 15 sometime after 1954 he disappeared into space in the cometeer on another expedition of discovery but this time he would not return for over 20 years 1970s 1980s edit in 1976 captain comet returned to earth having not aged with a new protective costume instead of a spacesuit and enhanced skills controlling his appearance mentally although dressing in 1950s style and with a powerful physical punch as well as a mental force super speed and an ability to manipulate objects he also had an explanation for his absence having always felt alienated from normal humans because of his abilities he has been over 20 years in space 16 after misreading a battle between green lantern and gorilla grodd and some trickery by grodd he ended up joining the secret society of super villains and battled darkseid and the forces of apokolips with them 17 later he turned down full membership in the justice league but became an honorary member and took up residence in their satellite headquarters 18 after fighting chronos and dinosaurs in gotham city 19 the captain continued his crusade against the secret society of super villains despite a number of setbacks orchestrated by gorilla grodd 20 although present at the marriage of ray palmer and jean loring several months later 21 captain comet remained off radar for nearly two years eventually contacting superman when the effect of the comet that mutated him wore off turning him into a human comet whose powers fluctuated wildly 22 with superman s help he tracked down the comet and stabilized his powers superman s help was needed again six years later when the villain brain storm attempted to augment his waning powers by stealing captain comet s power which accidentally evolved him to a more advanced form temporarily 23 1990s l e g i o n r e b e l s edit he spent the next few years roaming the stars just drifting 24 before being captured by the space outlaw dagon ra 25 despite his new powers including near invulnerability telekinesis and increased strength rescued by l e g i o n he recuperated in their headquarters hospital and was invited to join them soon after 26 and did so a year later 27 his involvement with l e g i o n was in a supporting role he fell in love with fellow member scientist marij n bek who nursed him back to health and studied the massive headaches he frequently suffered these were the result of his possession by a psi creature in space before meeting l e g i o n it was eventually purged by vril dox leaving the captain once again hospitalised for months 28 soon after he was apparently killed by lady quark who had been possessed by the same parasite buried under a mountain on ith kaa 29 he eventually dug himself out 30 and used his knowledge to manipulate the savage indigenous population to achieve the technological level to build him a spaceship explaining later without irony that it took six months to industrialize the tribal society because they were slow learners 31 returning to r e b e l s homeworld of cairn he learned that vril dox s son lyrl had brainwashed most of the l e g i o n made the key l e g i o n members fugitives and taken control of cairn he and maryj n formed a resistance movement to free the population and overthrow lyrl and were key in successfully defeating him as a result captain comet became leader of the new reformed l e g i o n 32 during this period captain comet took up residence with tyrone an artificially created telepathic clone bulldog in the zelazny building on hardcore station a corrupt commercial satellite station with a population of several million in a free space zone between a number of trading civilisations 33 post 1990s edit rann thanagar war edit at some undefined point in the next 10 years captain comet stepped down as leader and became a paid freelance aide and agent to vril dox who took back the l e g i o n reins he was next seen with dox under contract to the planet ancar which had been invaded by khunds during the rann thanagar war after intervention by green lantern kyle rayner he decided to stay and help him end the war 34 he first accompanied kyle to the destroyed planet thanagar where they built a protective dome and terraformed the land to create a secure environment for the survivors 35 then he joined up with adam strange and hawkman to defend rann against the thanagarians under the control of the demon onimar synn who he was instrumental in destroying 36 52 and mystery in space edit a year after the events of infinite crisis captain comet was captured and tortured by lady styx forcing him to jettison his primary consciousness from his body before death 37 his psychic self merged briefly with that of the weird which had been drifting in space since his death 38 and both were revived in new bodies 33 captain comet s new body re formed at hardcore station with golden eyes a 20 year old s physique and the ability to teleport although he had lost some strength shortening his name to comet and fostering the misconception that he was his own nephew he searched for the remains of his old body on hardcore station discovering that it had been stolen by the eternal light corporation church and he was being hunted by a team of their telepathic assassins 39 on breaking into the eternal light corporation s building he uncovered that brainwashed cloned telepaths were being grown from the charred remains of his corpse which he destroyed becoming a fugitive he hid from the e l c so they could not use his new body to continue their cloning allowing thousands of hardcore residents to die when the e l c cut off life support to a whole area of hardcore station to force them to surrender comet eventually he destroyed all the clones and the e l c also killing hundreds of their followers rann thanagar holy war strange adventures vol 3 and r e b e l s edit target of an assassination attempt by a surviving e l c follower during a resurgence of the faith comet accepted an offer by adam strange to leave hardcore station and help quell growing religious fanaticism on rann 40 he ended up working with adam strange hawkman starfire the weird and the prince gavyn starman against the influences of the warring lord synnar a cosmic tyrant behind the eternal light corporation and lady styx on rann and thanagar which once again set the two planets on course for war their interference was eventually key in lord synnar s plans to reach a higher plane of existence 41 later comet learned from the future spirit of synnar that he is destined to be one of the aberrant six a group critical to preventing synnar trapped in the weird s body from destroying the universe ultimately the aberrant six did not form and the future synnar was forced to leave after comet s mercenary friend eye was killed by synnar s supreme god enemy comet was entrusted with eye s robot companion orb until synnar returns to continue his negotiations comet then returned to hardcore station 42 and almost immediately joined vril dox s new r e b e l s 43 he entered into a brief relationship with starfire and helped defeat starro the conqueror saving rann the vega system and the galaxy the new 52 edit adam blake was re introduced in the 2011 new 52 event during grant morrison and rags morales revamp of action comics 44 in this reality adam blake was comet a hyper evolved human who at the time of his birth a comet passed over his house the comet s radiation caused his body to evolve and be as scientist emery zackro called it born 1000 years ahead of his time 45 misunderstood he was shunned by his father and the rest of the town and roamed rural kansas for several years until he was found by a group of aliens called the oort kind who travel the universe looking for beings like adam to recruit them to serve as warriors 46 47 comet returns to earth to collect suzie lane lois lane s niece who like himself is a neo sapian which brings him into conflict with superman until suzie uses her powers to drive comet away 48 when superman is attacked by the fifth dimensional demon vyndktvx comet returns with his fellow neo sapians to assist they subdue the kryptonite men and rescue krypto while comet deals with the phantom king before helping to banish vyndktvx back to the fifth dimension 49 comet then appears in telos 2 as part of a resistance on colu along with techne brainiac s daughter k rot and stealth they help telos and brainiac take down the ruler of colu named computo powers and abilities edit captain comet in rann thanagar war 5 2005 art by ivan reis captain comet is supposedly the pinnacle of human evolution his mutant mental functions not only give him genius level i q but endow him with a photographic memory

the anti monitor first appeared in crisis on infinite earths 2 although he remained in shadow until crisis on infinite earths 5 and was created by marv wolfman george pérez and jerry ordway 4 he was believed to have been destroyed in crisis on infinite earths 12 only to return after a long absence in green lantern sinestro corps special 1 august 2007 fictional character biography edit origins edit during the crisis on infinite earths it was revealed how the existence of all parallel universes in the multiverse came to be including the positive matter multiverse and also the anti matter universe and how the monitor and the anti monitor came into existence when the menace posed by the anti monitor became apparent several villains were sent back in time to stop him but were defeated by krona and the other oans citation needed in a final revision it was established that it increased entropy in the universe shortening its existence by a billion years see heat death 5 in any event two beings were created one on the moon of oa and the other on the moon of qward on the moon of oa the being known as the monitor was instantly aware of his counterpart the anti monitor although his official name is the monitor in his own universe and he is often addressed as such the name anti monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart by this time the anti monitor had quickly conquered qward as well as the rest of the anti matter universe citation needed in searching for other places to conquer he also became aware of his counterpart these two beings battled for a million years unleashing great powers against each other but to no avail at the end of their stalemate they simultaneously attacked one another rendering both inert for nine billion years citation needed in final crisis it was revealed that in the wake of the birth of the original multiverse an unfathomable being of limitless imagination the original monitor or overmonitor became aware of the life germinating in the budding multiverse occupying the void space in which he resided and which he encompassed curious about it and wanting to interact with and know better the lesser life forms birthed by the multiverse he fashioned a probe a smaller monitor unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time the probe monitor was instantly split into two symmetrical opposite beings upon coming into contact with the multiverse itself the monitor embodying the positive matter and goodness and the anti monitor embodying anti matter and evil 6 the anti monitor who appears monstrous barely resembles the monitor who bears a physically near human appearance the anti monitor has empty sometimes luminous eye sockets and a wide wrinkled mouth often mistaken for a mass of teeth when his armor is destroyed by supergirl his form appears not dissimilar to that of the monitor but unstable and surrounded by a coruscating aura of radiant energy his life force leaking out like water from a failing vessel explaining the need for the armor the anti monitor himself refers to the armor as his life shell 7 when the manhunters re build his armor it is revealed his body is little more than a churning mass of energy 8 much later when his helmet is disintegrated by firestorm the anti monitor s head is revealed to be featureless except for his eyes and mouth 9 crisis on infinite earths edit main article crisis on infinite earths the anti monitor at war with the multiverse s heroes on crisis on infinite earths 12 march 1986 art by george pérez in more modern times the being known as pariah performed an experiment similar to the one krona attempted long ago on a parallel earth this was changed later to an alternate world in the post crisis single universe citation needed this experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the monitor and the anti monitor and the destruction of pariah s earth and his universe citation needed the anti monitor rebuilt his army taking over qward and using the thunderers as his own private army as well as creating the shadow demons from the elite of the thunderers citation needed the anti monitor then released a massive anti matter wave absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes and growing stronger even as his counterpart grew weaker and employed the second psycho pirate using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy citation needed the monitor along with his aide harbinger gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the anti monitor 10 one of harbinger s duplicates was taken control of by the anti monitor and apparently killed the monitor but the monitor was able to use his death to create a pocket universe to contain the remaining realities from the anti monitor s attack after defeats by various heroes including the flash barry allen and supergirl sacrificing themselves to destroy an anti matter cannon 11 and to save superman 7 respectively the anti monitor absorbed the entirety of the anti matter universe and traveled to the beginning of time intending to stop the formation of the positive matter multiverse and to create a multiverse where anti matter prevailed when the heroes followed him there he began to drain the power from most of them citation needed however the actions of the spectre empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving earths brought the anti monitor to a stalemate the villains of said earths sent to stop krona from viewing the origins of the universe failed due to squabbling allowing krona to see the hands of the anti monitor and the spectre struggling for domination which collapsed the current multiverse citation needed from the ashes rose a new singular universe while various persons adjusted to the newly singular earth including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the multiverse the anti monitor enraged drew this new earth into the anti matter universe intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all 12 what followed was the shadow demon war wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the anti monitor s forces finally the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains most notably doctor light the heroic alexander luthor jr of earth three darkseid superboy of earth prime and kal l the superman of earth two were able to weaken the anti monitor enough for kal l to deliver the final blow destroying the anti monitor by punching him into a star the star went nova and caused anti matter waves to erupt threatening to destroy the entire anti matter universe kal l and superboy prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates when alexander luthor using his power to open dimensions revealed that he had created a paradise dimension and he used it to prevent the lois lane kent of earth two from being erased from existence when the post crisis universe was formed as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss using his own body as a portal alexander luthor kal l and superboy prime went into the paradise dimension alongside lois 13 among the other beings who died because of his actions were the entire crime syndicate of america kid psycho nighthawk the losers flower of easy company starman the immortal man the dove kole clayface ii the bug eyed bandit the angle man prince ra man sunburst lori lemaris aquagirl earth 2 s green arrow huntress robin and alexander luthor sr of earth three just to name a few infinite crisis edit main article infinite crisis the anti monitor s corpse turned into a tower panel from infinite crisis 3 february 2006 art by phil jimenez the superman and lois lane of earth two superboy of earth prime and alexander luthor jr of earth three were revealed to be observing the events of the newly formed universe as well as the actions of its heroes from their home in the hidden pocket universe upon observing the events leading up to infinite crisis the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore earth two s existence at the expense of earth one 14 the anti monitor s remains were then used by alexander luthor as part of a tuning fork similar to the ones used during the first crisis this construct then created the vibrational frequency that earth two was on prior to its non existence which in turn recreated earth two with no visible effect on earth one save the movement of characters who originated on earth two to the recreated earth two 15 alexander luthor then recreated the other earths with his tuning fork with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said earths citation needed superboy prime followed soon by bart allen then returned from the speed force wearing what appeared to be select elements of the anti monitor s armor using it as a yellow sunlight collector 16 ultimately the tower was destroyed when kon el the modern superboy and superboy prime crashed into it while fighting each other forcing all of the earths to merge into a new earth once again kon el died in the arms of wonder girl as superboy prime fled 17 post crisis impact edit despite his extremely limited exposure he only appeared in the crisis on infinite earths miniseries a single issue of wonder woman 18 and the flash vol 2 149 150 citation needed the anti monitor was responsible for one of the most profound changes in the entire history of dc comics the dc universe and all of its parallel universes the anti matter universe still existed now with both qward said to be the counterpart of oa and an alternate earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains each taking the opposite role among its planets 19 perhaps the most notable impact the anti monitor had on the post crisis universe was the elimination of the multiverse aspect of the dc universe previously there existed an infinite number of earths each one with a unique history that could be accessed through various means the most common being vibrational attunement during post crisis with the restart of the universe as one thanks to the machinations of the anti monitor a simpler more streamlined dc universe seemed imminent with characters acquired from charlton comics fawcett comics and quality comics all becoming incorporated into the new dc universe post infinite crisis edit the anti monitor resemblance seen in the background in dcu brave new world 1 art by ariel olivetti at the end of dc comics 2006 special brave new world it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves the monitors watching over the new post infinite crisis earth four of the figures resemble the original monitor from crisis on infinite earths and the fifth figure resembles the anti monitor 20 in the pages of countdown it has been revealed that there are fifty two monitors with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new multiverse each with a slightly different appearance a monitor was shown in supergirl recalling dark angel one of his agents this monitor was dressed like the anti monitor but appeared to have no other connection 21 sinestro corps edit prominent members of the sinestro corps with a manhunter at far left including clockwise from top left hank henshaw superboy prime the anti monitor parallax inhabiting kyle rayner and sinestro art by ethan van sciver it was revealed that the anti monitor was reborn following the recreation of the multiverse and that he had been fueling sinestro s ideology since the return of hal jordan acting as the sinestro corps guardian of fear 22 his body was rebuilt by the manhunters and in addition he recruited superboy prime the cyborg superman and parallax who was using kyle rayner as its host along with sinestro as his heralds 23 during the war between the sinestro corps and the green lantern corps the anti monitor contacted cyborg superman to inquire about the status of new warworld citation needed the cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon qward and that he would kill henshaw for his services allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the cyborg 24 when the lost lanterns made their way to the anti matter universe to save hal jordan and the ion power they inadvertently stumbled upon the anti monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on qward citation needed he was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the ion entity previously inhabiting kyle rayner he proceeded to kill ke haan before the other lanterns forced him back taking the ion entity from the planet and the anti matter universe citation needed the anti monitor pursued the lanterns for a short while long enough for hal jordan guy gardner john stewart and the other lanterns to learn of his return citation needed having this vital information they then leave qward shortly after the sinestro corps launched its attack on earth the anti monitor traveled to the planet aboard new warworld and landed shortly thereafter along with sinestro 25 he was attacked by sodam yat and other members of the green lantern corps but the tyrant killed the two unnamed lanterns and severely injured the daxamite lantern 25 the anti monitor began to siphon the positive matter of new york city to create his anti matter waves however he was attacked by the guardians of the universe angry at being impotent during his first war the anti monitor was able to counter the vicious attack permanently disfiguring the face of scar 25 john stewart and guy gardner brought down new warworld and the yellow central power battery which were detonated next to the anti monitor and contained by a shield created by hundreds of green lanterns to contain the explosion even this was not enough to kill him superboy prime seeing an opportunity to defeat the now weakened anti monitor flew through the anti monitor s chest and hurled his shattered body into space 25 the anti monitor s corpse crash landed on desert planet where a voice later revealed to be nekron acknowledged him and told him to rise before he could escape the anti monitor found himself imprisoned inside a large black power battery 25 soon afterwards the guardian scar corrupted by the anti monitor s energies dispatched the green lanterns ash and saarek to locate and recover the anti monitor s body 26 blackest night edit main article blackest night green lanterns ash and saarek find the black central power battery on the dead planet ryut in sector 666 and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet killing them citation needed when the black central power battery is later brought to earth the anti monitor stirs within demanding to be let out he begins draining the white energies of dove in order to escape 27 the anti monitor is reanimated as a black lantern independent from nekron s control the anti monitor is attacked by the various lantern corps just as he is about to pull himself out of the battery combining their energies the various lantern corps use dove as a human bullet shooting the anti monitor through the head and pulling him back into the battery 28 the anti monitor is eventually resurrected by a white power ring and breaks free of the battery fighting nekron in revenge for imprisoning him nekron then banishes the anti monitor back to the anti matter universe 29 brightest day edit main article brightest day later the anti monitor is confronted by the white lantern boston brand 30 as brand is forced by the white ring to fight for his life damaging the anti monitor s chest plate armor the anti monitor retaliates by firing a burst of anti matter energy at brand who evades the blast the anti monitor resumes his duties in the anti matter universe while brand leaves 31 he also prevented deathstorm the black lantern version of firestorm in his attempt to destroy the white lantern battery and instead commands him to bring the lantern to him as well as an army at which point deathstorm brings back the black lantern versions of professor zoom maxwell lord hawk jade captain boomerang martian manhunter aquaman hawkman hawkgirl deadman and osiris 32 the anti monitor in brightest day 3 june 2010 art by ivan reis deathstorm eventually brought the white lantern battery to him and he tried to access the white lantern power however his efforts are prevented by firestorm who after engaging in battle with the anti monitor and the black lanterns is able to regain the white power battery from the anti monitor it is also revealed that the entity allowed itself to be captured so it could obtain unspecified information from the anti monitor 33 the new 52 edit the anti monitor was introduced in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe in the final page of the forever evil storyline it is revealed to the reader as the being which destroyed ultraman s krypton and earth 3 as he is seen finishing off earth 3 the anti monitor declares darkseid shall be mine 34 the anti monitor has found the prime earth because the ring of volthoom s energy signature was emitting a traceable pulse he was also responsible for blinding martian manhunter s earth 3 counterpart by burning out his eyes and destroying one of his arms beyond repair even by the capabilities that martians possess 35 when metron confronted the anti monitor amidst the ruins of earth 3 it was revealed the anti monitor was the former owner of metron s traveling device the mobius chair and that his true name is mobius he intends to make up for an unknown wrong he regrets and to this end intends to kill darkseid with the help of the latter s daughter 36 the half amazon half apokoliptian known as grail 37 with the help of grail the anti monitor attacks the justice league on prime earth while waiting for darkseid as he was promised by grail 38 it is eventually revealed that mobius became what he is after attempting to peer into the origins of the anti matter universe on qward similar to how krona sought the origins of his positive matter universe while the white light of the life equation was the origin of the positive universe it is the anti life equation that serves as the foundation of the anti matter universe and mobius released it from within the world of qward transforming him into the anti monitor with the anti life equation in his body anti monitor has the ability to enslave any living thing to his will he uses this power to bind the black racer to the flash enslaving the new god and using him to kill darkseid 39 having killed darkseid the anti monitor cocooned himself in a shell of energy and eventually separated himself from the anti life equation which was then obtained by grail 40 shortly afterward he emerged from his shell changed into a more human looking form once

until grail darkseid s daughter appears with steve trevor in tow she has transferred the anti life to him making him into a new vessel for its power now basically a living weapon under grail s control trevor releases a tremendous blast of power against mobius reducing him to a smoldering skeleton 43 dc rebirth edit in the dc rebirth relaunch anti monitor s history is revealed where he and his brothers monitor mar novu and world forger were created by a super celestial named perpetua in the sixth dimension where she tasked them to monitor their assigned realms anti monitor was tasked to

of america s attempts in retrieving starman s cosmic rod and to head to atlantis to use the conch of arion to return everyone back to the present the anti monitor is confronted by perpetua and apex lex who try to convert him to their cause but are interrupted by the arrival of the monitor world forger hawkgirl and starman the anti monitor fuses with his brothers to become the ultra monitor and fight their mother they are able to hold back perpetua but due to doom s influence empowering her and hawkgirl straying from the plan the ultra monitor is defeated when perpetua gives the anti monitor the anti life back restoring him to his pre crisis appearance and changing allegiance to perpetua anti monitor is sent by perpetua to kill hawkgirl and shayne who perpetua has stranded in space and prevented from returning to earth before he can kill the two the anti monitor is struck by john stewart green lantern who was driving the flash s speed force car forcing the anti monitor back into his rebirth appearance and releasing the monitor and world forger the anti monitor cries out for his mother s help which he receives in the form of the fiery remains of earth 44 which perpetua flung towards his location 45 powers and abilities edit anti monitor is one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the dc universe he is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known dc supervillain having destroyed at least thousands of universes if not an actual infinitude of them 46 he was powerful enough to kill supergirl when she became distracted he consumed at least thousands of positive matter universes to increase his power and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse s strongest heroes simultaneously during the blackest night the anti monitor was reanimated as a black lantern however nekron was unable to fully control him and thus was only able to subdue the anti monitor to be used as a power source for the black lantern corps central battery much in the same way the entity parallax is the power source for the green lanterns battery the anti monitor was also responsible for the death of barry allen the hero better known as the flash after capturing barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable the anti monitor created an anti matter cannon that would destroy the then five remaining earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed the cannon was destroyed by the flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon s power source into itself causing it to explode and barry to disintegrate in addition to possessing vast size varying from about nine feet to hundreds of meters tall vastly superhuman strength extraordinary durability by the end of the crisis series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from superman and even surviving a blue star going supernova the ability to project destructive bolts of energy and greatly augmenting another being s powers as he did with psycho pirate whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle the anti monitor also possessed reality warping abilities which he displayed by removing psycho pirate s face the anti monitor also commanded an army of qwardians and shadow demons and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting merging or destroying entire universes by far his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself once he fused with his anti matter universe he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes in addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes he also absorbed the energy of over one million worlds in his own anti matter universe in order to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe when earth s heroes followed him to the beginning of time he then absorbed all of their power and energy this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the spectre during his final battle in crisis on infinite earths 12 the anti monitor maintained his power by feeding on a nearby star and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near death he absorbed his own anti matter demons to rejuvenate himself the anti monitor is not immortal but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti matter universe exists having been destroyed with an immense effort at the end of the crisis he was recreated by his universe just as he had been formed originally it s been revealed that if the anti monitor or any other member of his family were to be destroyed they would regenerate in the sixth dimension other versions edit in the chain lightning arc of the flash comics 47 history is altered when barry allen is killed before the events of crisis on infinite earths this forces wally west into a timeline where the anti monitor was never defeated and only the anti matter universe remains a parody of the anti monitor called the aunty monitor appeared in marvel comics what the satire comic 48 marvel s mighty mouse comic featured another parody the anti minotaur 49 the anti monitor makes a cameo appearance in justice league unlimited 32 june 2007 he is described by darkseid to be a celestial being composed of negative energy which darkseid sought to gain to fuel the anti life equation the monitor and anti monitor both appear in tiny titans 12 march 2009 with the monitor telling robin that he needs a hall pass and the anti monitor contradicting him because he is the anti monitor until the two start having a do not do too argument and the monitor says that everyone likes the anti monitor better the anti monitor plays a part in the third batman teenage mutant ninja turtles crossover seeking to merge the turtles and batman s universes together and create a reality he could control at will krang murdered the anti monitor and repurposed his corpse into an exo suit using the technology within to achieve his goal 50 in other media edit television edit arrowverse edit main articles arrowverse and crisis on infinite earths arrowverse the anti monitor makes his live action debut in the arrowverse crossover crisis on infinite earths portrayed by lamonica garrett 51 at some point in between elseworlds and crisis the anti monitor found the flash of earth 90 and used him to power an anti matter cannon to destroy the multiverse minutes before the crisis began the anti monitor tricked multiversal explorer nash wells into unlocking his prison under earth 1 central city once he grows strong enough he then possesses harbinger kills the monitor and succeeds in destroying the

regroup and restore existence with oliver queen spectre s help they defeat him and successfully reboot the multiverse despite this the anti monitor survived and attempted to get his revenge only to be defeated once and for all when the newly created earth prime s heroes attack him with a bomb capable of shrinking him for eternity a flashback in part four of the crossover showed that he learned of the multiverse s existence when a young mar novu accidentally entered his anti matter universe while attempting to time travel to the past to witness the birth of the universe animation edit the anti monitor makes his animated debut as the main antagonist of the second story arc of green lantern the animated series voiced by tom kenny 52 the animated version of the anti monitor features a more machine like face with glowing blue eyes and a flat surface where the mouth is this version of the anti monitor was created by the renegade guardian krona as the ultimate being one capable of anything even time travel when it was activated the anti monitor recognized its superiority and turned against krona forcing him to banish anti monitor to another universe he is first shown in the series in the new guy entering the show s universe by splitting open the fabric of space and heading down to a nearby junkyard planet destroying one of many automated security ships which tells him otherwise before declaring to several defunct manhunters that he is their new master before unleashing a signal that reactivates all manhunters across space for his own motives the heroes engage him in the second episode of the arc where he is shown as a giant stating he consumed the planets of his universe and hungers for more he shrugged off the most powerful attacks of both the lanterns and their starship the episode ends with him hitting hal jordan with an energy attack that ends up blasting him through a dimensional rift the next episode reveals he was blasted into anti monitor s prison universe completely empty except for a single sun and an alternate version of earth the latter of which was spared in return for helping anti monitor to escape his prison universe after returning to his original universe hal joins with his green lantern comrades to fight anti monitor and his manhunter army in the episode cold fury however a super charged and seemingly emotionless aya sends the anti monitor s head flying while she connects herself to his headless body for her own agenda however as revealed in ranx this did not kill the anti monitor and as a head ended up at the planet ranx where he intended to regain his power unfortunately aya and her modified manhunters attack ranx to obtain the device built in the anti monitor s head to arrive to the moment before the big bang though the anti monitor attempts to recruit hal kilowog and razer for protection aya breaks through ranx s defenses and subdues the lanterns though anti monitor suggests her to let him accompany her to see

the time because it cost five cents as opposed to the usual 10 cent price was half as long as the standard 64 page comic and came out every two weeks instead of every four 3 fictional character biography edit jim barr was the son of a police officer who was killed in the line of duty and as a result took it upon himself to fight crime 4 he was rejected from the police academy for physical reasons but got a job in ballistics like many characters of the time he used chemistry to develop powers for himself in his case greater muscle mass and brain power using his crime cure he also

cleaning crisis on infinite earths event dc began employing innovative writers many of them young and from the u k to revamp some of their old characters in the period that saw alan moore reinvent the swamp thing animal man was reimagined by scottish writer grant morrison morrison wrote the first 26 issues of the animal man comic book published between 1988 and 1990 with art by chas truog and doug hazlewood brian bolland provided the covers although the series was initially conceived as a four issue limited series it was upgraded into an ongoing series following strong sales consequently morrison developed several long running plots introducing mysteries some of which were not explained until a year or two later the title featured the protagonist both in and increasingly out of costume morrison made the title character an everyman figure living in a universe populated by superheroes aliens and fantastic technology buddy s wife ellen his son cliff 9 years old at the beginning of the series and his daughter maxine 5 years old featured prominently in most storylines and his relationship with them as husband father and provider was an ongoing theme the series championed vegetarianism and animal rights causes morrison themself supported in one issue buddy helps a band of self described eco terrorists save a pod of dolphins enraged at a fisherman s brutality buddy drops him into the ocean intending for him to drown ironically the man is saved by a dolphin buddy fought several menaces such as an ancient murderous spirit that was hunting him brutal murderous thanagarian warriors and even the easily defeated red robots of an elderly villain who was tired of life the series made deep sometimes esoteric references to the entire dc canon including b wana beast the mirror master and arkham asylum soon after the launch of his series animal man briefly became a member of justice league europe appearing in several early issues of their series following morrison s run peter milligan wrote a six issue story featuring several surreal villains and heroes exploring questions about identity and quantum physics and utilizing the textual cut up technique popularized by william burroughs tom veitch and steve dillon then took over for 18 issues in which buddy returns to his work as a movie stuntman and explores mystical totemic aspects of his powers jamie delano wrote 29 issues with steve pugh as artist with occasional issues by other artists like will simpson giving the series a more horror influenced feel with a suggested for mature readers label on the cover beginning with issue 51 vertigo edit after jamie delano s first six issues wherein among other things he killed off the central character of buddy baker created the red analogous to the green of swamp thing and resurrected buddy as an animal avatar the series became one of the charter titles of dc s new mature readers vertigo imprint with 57 and its ties to the dc universe became more tenuous vertigo was establishing itself as a distinct mini universe with its own continuity only occasionally interacting with the continuity of the regular dc universe the title evolved into a more horror themed book with buddy eventually becoming a non human animal god the superhero elements of the book were largely removed since buddy was reborn as a kind of animal elemental and legally deceased he discarded his costume stopped associating with other heroes and generally abandoned his crimefighting role he co founded the life power church of maxine to further an environmentalist message drifting along u s route 66 to settle in montana delano s final issue was 79 culminating in buddy dying several more times between issues 66 and 67 delano also penned animal man annual 1

black orchid the books of magic and doom patrol book ended by two children s crusade issues co written by neil gaiman and starring his dead boy detectives a brief run by jerry prosser and fred harper featured a re reborn buddy as a white haired shamanistic figure before the series was canceled after the 89th issue due to declining sales back in the dcu edit after the cancellation of his own series animal man made cameos in several other titles returning to his standard costumed form he has been utilized in most of the recent dc company wide crossovers fighting alongside other less mainstream heroes including infinite crisis and 52 the latter of which was co written by grant morrison as well as justice league of america 25 the last days of animal man miniseries edit in 2009 gerry conway

message buddy baker gained animal powers when he encountered a spaceship that blew up infusing him with radiation he used his powers to fight crime and ward off alien attackers he then joined the forgotten heroes group prior to the crisis on infinite earths he was seen with this group during the crisis baker s post crisis origin was slightly altered but it retained the essence of the original while hunting as a teenager he encountered a crashed spaceship that apparently endowed him with his abilities the slight discrepancies between the two stories were addressed as pre crisis and post crisis origins and were acknowledged in story with the original buddy baker appearing and not wishing to be written out of existence after an apparently unsuccessful stint as a superhero followed by a hiatus where he utilized his powers to work as a film stuntman baker decided to restart and make a career out of it after being inspired by the headline making justice league international this is where his self titled series begins he is married to his high school sweetheart ellen a storyboard artist and later an illustrator for children s books they have two children cliff and maxine who are a pre teen and toddler respectively when the series starts they live in a suburban area outside of san diego through the series animal man becomes a man of great compassion toward all creatures an ardent animal rights activist an environmentalist and a vegetarian later he finds his link to the m field has been passed on to his daughter maxine who is also connected to the animal kingdom although he wears a mask he goes to no great lengths to conceal his true identity a jacket was added to animal man s costume so he could have pockets and a place to put his keys as well as notes from his wife however this jacket was denim and not a leather jacket buddy specifically discusses that he will not wear leather out of moral considerations an early aspect of the character was his desire for fame and is manifested by his wish to be in the justice league he is initially driven by a desire for the publicity from interviews and public appearances more than any altruistic impulse buddy joins the newly formed justice league europe and bonds with dmitri of the rocket reds over the shared experiences of being fathers 17 he soon resigns due to tragic events taking place later in his series 18 after a brief period of reconditioning and exploration of his limits baker s first work is a job from s t a r labs investigating a break in at an animal testing facility he traces it to the hero b wana beast whom he is able to befriend and aid the conditions he witnesses at the testing facilities compel him to become vegetarian a sudden decision that briefly puts him at odds with his family baker also becomes a staunch animal rights activist and goes on several missions with environmental themes during his further adventures he experiences glitches with his powers he also begins experiencing evidences of his existence within a comic book although he does not immediately understand them for what they are he is targeted for murder by a mysterious organization upset with his environmental work and must face the new mirror master baker is also pursued by dr james highwater a physicist with no memory of any prior existence and seemingly no purpose other than to contact baker a parallel story involves a pair of yellow aliens described as agents of some unspecified higher power that engineered the spaceship wreck that granted his powers who are aware of the events of the crisis and monitor baker s actions they are aware of a second crisis coming which they believe that only animal man can avert they reconcile the two variations of animal man s origin through an unexplained surgery that also extends his abilities elsewhere in arkham asylum the psycho pirate aware of continuity and his fictional environment opens a gateway into the real world and other comic book realities and begins bringing several characters no longer in continuity into existence 19 baker is demoralized however when firefighters are injured in a laboratory blaze started by activists that he was working with he is approached by highwater just as he decides to give up his costumed identity while away on a vision quest with highwater in which he learns the true nature of his powers and briefly sees the comic s reader baker s family is brutally murdered by an assassin sent by the corporate heads seeking to stop his environmental work with the help of the mirror master who had turned down the hit baker tracks down the businessmen and assassin and kills them while trying to undo his family s deaths with a time machine baker accidentally becomes warped through time and meets the phantom stranger jason blood and the immortal man in the 1960s who help him learn to accept his grief baker is then contacted by the aliens and taken to arkham where he stops the psycho pirate and prevents damage to the continuity baker is transported to limbo and encounters several comic book characters who are not being used in stories ultimately baker encounters his own writer grant morrison themself and the two share a conversation on the relationship between the creator and the fictional characters whose lives they write after this encounter baker is sent back home and his family are restored back to life it is left ambiguous as to whether or not baker remembers the full nature of these events next after falling into a coma buddy finds himself in a strange alternative reality which he correctly deduces is a divergent phase of existence and is then able to return home having since left the justice league baker resumes his stunt work career he also finds himself frequently displaying uncontrolled animalistic behavior he is assaulted by a neighbor travis cody a burnout with a phd in electronic engineering from mit cody has deduced that baker s powers have become skewed and that unfocused usage of his abilities kills animals after reaching an understanding the two work together to measure and enhance animal man s powers they are themselves targeted by a group of shamans one of whom was present at animal man s origin and who are aware of the yellow aliens and the writer during this time baker s daughter maxine begins demonstrating powers similar to his own and is able to communicate with the head shaman who is attempting to bring baker to him s t a r labs again contacts baker offering a position as their spokesman on environmentalism but he declines after an accident in which baker kills the entire population of the san diego zoo his wife takes their daughter to live with her mother in vermont to avoid the media attention baker descends into depression and his son runs away eventually ending up with an uncle a lecherous predator baker goes to vermont as well where he finally meets the shaman meanwhile cody has been hired by s t a r labs for his expertise and while there he uncovers a conspiracy involving one of the shamans but is mentally trapped in cyberspace baker continued to split his time between his family his career as animal man and regular stunt work for films he occasionally lent his talents to various superhero groups including the jla and the forgotten heroes and played a prominent role in the swamp thing s task force the

she had returned to the justice league following the events of the dark nights death metal storyline series 43 powers and abilities edit buddy can mimic the abilities of any animal as a result of his encounter with a crashed alien spacecraft he does this by either focusing on a specific animal near him or as he learns later by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general this enables him to even mimic animals that are extinct the nature of these powers has been described in various ways including the superficial alien radiation explanation of his early appearances the reconstruction of his body by aliens with morphogenetic grafts at the cellular level and currently mystical access to a morphogenetic field created by all living creatures also known as the red he does not grow wings to fly as a bird instead he flies in classic superman style nor does he form gills to breathe underwater when mimicking a fish but he has occasionally been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals such as adopting the claws of a wolverine temporarily or his metamorphosis toward the end of delano s run on his series among the animal powers buddy has been known to use are the strength of a tyrannosaurus rex the flight of a bird the swimming ability of a fish the speed of an ant the reflexes of a fly the eloquence of a parrot the wall crawling of a spider the sonic blast of a pistol shrimp the sense of smell of a moth the stench of a skunk the color changing of a chameleon the agility of a snake the playfulness of a kitten the electricity of an electric eel and electric ray a worm s ability to re grow lost body parts the righteous anger of a mother bear the bark of a large dog the reproduction abilities of protozoa the durability of a cockroach the ability to fire lightning from his face from an unidentified alien creature the beauty of a monarch butterfly the smell of a hippopotamus the napping ability of a cat the level of buddy s abilities is proportional to the size of the animal they are drawn from hence drawing the jumping ability from a flea would allow him to cover great distances however taking the abilities of a larger animal does not result in diminished power for him in some appearances he can also talk to animals and enter their minds tapping into the red animal man can also fire blasts of force or unidentified energy in cooperation with vixen and the woman known as tristess he helped to create an entire universe 44 in 52 buddy experiences an upgrade that allows him to connect to the universe s morphogenetic field providing him

captain atom vol 3 12 february 1988 and was created by cary bates greg weisman and pat broderick 2 fictional character biography edit early life edit major force is a product of the same u s federal project which created captain atom during the vietnam war the government in a project headed by wade eiling and the scientist megala was experimenting with the effects of atomic energy on an alien metal they had taken from a crashed spaceship to determine its full protective abilities such as protecting a human being from a nuclear blast after the disappearance of nathaniel adam and the perceived failure of the captain atom project the government restarted the project with a new subject clifford zmeck and increased the amount of metal used captain atom 36 december 1989 while in the usaf zmeck had been jailed in a high security prison for rape and murder and sentenced to life in prison he was offered a pardon in exchange for participation in the high risk governmental experiment the results were the same as with the captain atom project and zmeck disappeared into the quantum field emerging one year after the return of nathaniel adam this time the government was ready and placed microimplants ranging from knockout gas to mini explosives under the metal while it was still malleable in order to control zmeck in case he went rogue during one mission a government operator who was actually the son of the woman zmeck had murdered activated one such charge amputating zmeck s left hand introduced as an ally then successor to captain atom force s brutality betrayed his government concocted role of superhero and brought him in frequent conflict with atom major force is now arguably captain atom s arch enemy eventually he became a hired gun for general wade eiling s or any other crooked government affiliated group s purposes crime and punishment edit in green lantern vol 3 54 august 1994 major force killed alexandra alex dewitt girlfriend of the green lantern kyle rayner and stuffed her remains in a refrigerator where kyle would find her on behalf of the quorum organization who wanted the gl ring that fell into kyle s lap rayner tortured major force after their fight but was stopped by forces of lapd s special crimes unit in an issue of guy gardner warrior major force seemingly slays guy s mother in the same manner as kyle s beloved girlfriend after some confusion it is learned force had killed a neighbor who had been house sitting having heard from rayner about how zmeck murdered his beloved gardner who has by now awakened to his vuldarian heritage summarily executes him with a shifted weapon s edge 3 this was not the end of zmeck however as quorum the very people who employed him to harass rayner and gardner had revived him and enhanced him with vuldarian dna his return started with force killing arisia a former green lantern and dear friend of guy gardner as a declaration of war against him in guy gardner warrior 43 june 1996 force was apparently confronted in new york united states of america by gardner after a brief skirmish between the two force seemingly murdered guy in his weakened state only for the latter to revive himself before dealing major force a fatal blow causing the villain to implode seemingly killing him again in revenge 4 in reality force is made of energy and not matter he cannot die and has effectively gained immortality as is made apparent in resurrection man 21 february 1999 he somehow revived himself from death prior to a ripple in the quantum field of reality which somehow revitalized major force giving him enough raw power to challenge the jla directly with the assistance of a quantum powered resurrection man only to be disassembled into particles by the immortal loner but still to reform himself at a later date some time afterwards he gets into a skirmish with superman over misinformation regarding his position in the government gaining the upper hand using dark quantum energy to sap superman s solar energy but kal el turns the tables on him by exploiting his lack of ability namely by hyper heating his dilustel body to the point of flash melting him in place

harbors batman convinces captain atom to absorb the energy leaking from force which threatens to decimate the city captain atom absorbs all the energy and disappears moving several years into the future in a quantum leap as described in superman batman 25 a copy of major force s mind his thoughts and his anger get mixed in with the essence of the new kryptonite man in green lantern vol 3 180 october 2004 force apparently kills maura rayner mother of kyle rayner he later says it was just a mannequin kyle snaps and rips off force s head still talking seals it in a bubble of green lantern energy and sends it into outer space kyle later finds out his mother is alive and well one year later edit main article one year later major force reappeared in the new battle for blüdhaven book a

with it major victory reappears in issue 7 he also picked a fight with hal jordan as force vowed to kill any green lantern on sight after his last encounter with kyle rayner jordan personally wants to end force s killing spree enraged by alexandra dewitt and arisia s murders and even sent force to a hard light constructed refrigerator similar to what force had done to dewitt during the fight however captain atom was revived by the atomic knights in issue 6 as monarch and force s rampage was quickly brought to an end when atom drains him of his energy leaving nothing but a husk force s deflated corpse was last seen falling to the ground during the chaos left by atom s energy expenditure resulting in a nuclear blast major force is later seen reconstituted and a part of a whole new regiment of s h a d e super soldiers manufactured at the behest of gonzo the mechanical bastard out on the white house lawn 6 a battle ensues between the false presidency s shadow cabinet and uncle sam his freedom fighters for the soul of america wherein he is quickly dispatched by miss america even after showcasing newfound super speed against her 7 he was later seen being a part of the secret society during preparations for oliver and dinah s wedding 8 his image appears in the series ion as a representation of kyle rayner s fear blackest night edit major force s body is seen being kept in a secured crypt beneath the justice league of america s hall of justice in washington dc during blackest night 1 he is subsequently seen alive and well among a band of villains that includes eclipso and dr polaris in justice society of america 29 9 he is also seen in the pages of action comics 882 as part of the government project 7734 attempting to capture the rogue captain atom who had since returned to his former identity the new 52 edit in the new 52 reboot launched in 2011 major force has his first major appearance in the fury of firestorm the nuclear man 20 vol 2 july 2013 he is introduced as a government agent working under general wade eiling with a special rank that allows him to represent all branches of the united states military his primary goal is to protect and later escort firestorm from the threat of various rogues and to convince him to work for the government major force had previously appeared in silhouette before his full appearance major force s design is the same as that of black jack also referred to as major bolton a character who had appeared earlier in the new 52 black jack is an agent of the black razors who had first appeared in voodoo vol 2 2 december 2011 in voodoo vol 2 5 march 2012 and 7 may 2012 it is revealed that he was given powers by the black razors due to the recommendation of his superior commander andrew lincoln of the blackhawks black jack was killed by voodoo in voodoo vol 2 7 may 2012 black jack force was seen alive again some time later when ordered by general eiling to bring in firestorm under the pretense that the rogue meta was a threat to national security 10 eager for a chance at a rematch with the nuclear powered superhero force eagerly accepted the mission attacking him in the center of a populated area in portland oregon he s eventually bested when the conflicting personas of raymond and stein gain new trust in one another poolingng their resource as firestorm together to take the special agent down this was however a clever ruse on the major s part as he simply acted as a distraction for wade s secondary strike team to come up from behind and cage the conjoined entity in a magnetokinetic plasma field 11 upon return to the base major force proved he held more of a moral compass compared to his superior disgusted with the torment the good general was subjugating their quarry too when the containment field threatened to cause firestorm to go nuclear major force immediately jumped into the fray smashing the containment field apart enabling the prisoner to escape irked by general eiling s reckless misconduct he relieved him of duty while threatening to report him to the higher authorities 12 dan jurgens writer of the fury of firestorm the nuclear man says major force had been introduced into the new 52 earlier suggesting that he and black jack are the same character 13 powers and abilities edit powers edit major force is coated with the same dilustel alien alloy that covers captain atom 14 as a result he also can access the quantum field and use its energies for a variety of powers unlike atom however his abilities stemmed from a different spectrum of the field granting him different powers from nathaniel aside from the augmented physicality also lacking the capability to switch between human and energy being forms at will this was theorized to be a result of the major force project using double the amount of alien alloy and detonating a bomb with a different blast yield when he debuted major force seemed to control matter much in the way captain atom controls energy therefore he could project high velocity blasts of dark matter from his hands he could manipulate this matter into various shapes and quantities using this ability to create a hand to replace the one that was blown off by implanted explosives underneath his skin he initially lacked the ability to fly but rather leapt great distances or traveled on ramps made of dark matter a seldom used facet of his dark matter powers was the capacity to convert whatever force he comes in contact with be it matter or energy into solid dark matter a trait that was embellished upon in batman the brave and the bold cartoon series 15 he seemed to show some minor self matter manipulation abilities as well thanks to an upgrade to his powers using some of guy gardner s alien dna being able to shape the metal of his dilustel into various weapons often using this in conjunction with his dark matter control 16 eventually major force learned how to tap the q field in order to fly both before and after his first revival from when the vuldarian guy gardner fatally wounded him showing off a whole host of aerial maneuvers while battling captain atom and the likes of one of the justice leagues various incarnations all of this in tandem with his metamorphic powers acquired from his gene splicing make major force all the more formidable an opponent to face matter energy powers aside major force is a physical powerhouse comparable to some of the strongest of dc s metahumans force s dilustel skin is linked to the quantum field which enables him to absorb and manipulate virtually limitless amounts of matter to dynamically empower himself in a similar way captain atom can absorb limitless energy this factor of his powers enables him superior strength able to knock around superman over several hundred miles from metropolis to ohio and trade blows with the equally powerful captain atom invulnerability withstanding all manner of energy attacks ranging from green lantern and vuldarian energy blasts resist small to large explosive forces and even weathered captain atom s quantum blasts more than once also due to his unique physiology major force lacks the need for physical sustenance thanks to the dilustel s connection to the q field he can survive indefinitely without need to eat sleep breath or rest while in action this enables him to thrive and speak freely in the vacuum of space due to his nature as pure material energy major force is functionally immortal in a similar vein to mitchell shelley the resurrection man the villain can be seemingly killed he will always revive and return to life more powerful than ever he is constantly learning to access new uses to his power every time that he is critically wounded or suffers fatal inquiry he will regenerate resurrect stronger than before 17 both through this factor of his powers and over time with his many experiences zmeck became all the more familiar with using his quantum based abilities he eventually discovers that he could pull off many new tricks similar to captain atom such usage of his powers as a result of better understanding them throughout his career as a supervillain include discharging quantum blasts throwing up protective force field bubbles utilize his q energy for simulated tk to lift and move around objects simulate a form of quantum speed akin to resurrection man being able to detonate like a nuke with sufficient concentration and emit quantum blasts from any point on his body such as his hands eyes though he preferably focuses this through his hands as it is easier to control that way even being able to emit a type of dark quantum energy that can forcefully siphon energy away from other superpowered beings such as kryptonians but his skill in energy absorption is lacking compared to adam s as others have taken advantage of things the latter can handle which he cannot in later appearances force much like his counterpart captain atom had a radiological element introduced into his being in the event that his dilustel shell was ever ruptured a threatening if not outright lethal nuclear fallout would result in an atomic blast capable of leveling cities on top of all his abilities clifford zmeck is a military trained united states air force operative an armed forces sergeant and combat specialist eventually bumped up to army major after he was reinstated by general wade eiling upon his successful quantum jump into the future despite his loutish appearance like behavior major force is a seasoned war veteran with apparent skill in black ops infantry spy work as well as cqc closed quarters combat on top of this he has vast military connections within his government being their greatest weapon having ties with checkmate task force x quorum s security detail dilustel edit major force s metallic skin the shell which gives him his powers is dubbed dilustel it comprises an alien being the silver shield s and own physiological substance this transorganic metal was taken from said extra dimensional entity s own body and used in the atom project which would go on to birth individuals similar to him captain atom being the first successful subject and bombshell being the latest subject but unlike nathaniel who is able to coat himself with the metal at will force is unable to either partially or totally remove his dilustel from his body it s theorized this was due to using double the amount of the metal combined with a greater yield of nuke during his conception dilustel is virtually indestructible able to withstand all manner of punishment from a great many sources to a certain degree such as concussive force energy beams blunt trauma etc one of the few things that can damage it are x ionizer technologies which harden s material effected by it via atomic molecular lattice knitting making a knife sharp enough to pierce it or a bullet dense enough to perforate it being the only means of extracting it from silver shield the katana s soultaker sword is one of the few things that can rend major force s nigh invulnerable hide 18 cracking or rupturing his dermal layer causes major force to leak radiation at an uncontrollable rate to which he runs the risk of atomic detonation new 52 dc rebirth edit zmeck s powers in the company wide reboot remain largely the same but at lower levels than before he still boasts the same incredibly high levels of physical dexterity as he did in previous continuity retaining his paramount superhuman strength durability and stamina enable him to survive falling from tremendous heights leaving craters where he lands 19 instead of his typical quantum dark matter based superpowers he now emits a form of dark material energy he can discharge from his hands at will this force can strike with incredible heft carried behind it as he can easily decimate automobiles with ease 20 because he lacks the ability to fly by his own power he incorporates his leg muscles to carry himself over great distances instead 21 major force is physically powerful enough to challenge the physically amalgamated firestorm with relative ease actually overwhelming him in combat more than once he s also able to resist incredible amounts of blunt trauma to his physical frame able to resist sharp changes in temperature be it from killer frost s ice blasts or ronnie s nuclear blasts without sustaining physical injury 22 he can also take high end laser fire with ease and remain relatively unharmed showing little to zero discomfort 23 his abilities were given to him by the joint efforts of the internal operations black razor s and black hawk organization s under what procedure he was given his enhancements remains a mystery there are limits to his augmentations for in spite of his resilience and dynamism he can still be bled injured or killed by sufficiently powerful force he has been physically bested by the likes of superman on their first meeting 24 being killed by the rogue clone of the daemonite hybrid ms kitaen and sustained some minor burns in preventing firestorm from going thermonuclear 25 he may also retain his resurrection abilities from his previous existence as well as such he was killed by the evil voodoo yet turned up alive again a couple of years later after said turn of events other versions edit anti matter

bionics biorobotics or androids it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of feedback while cyborgs are commonly thought of as mammals including humans they might also conceivably be any kind of organism d s halacy s cyborg evolution of the superman 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a new frontier that was not merely space but more profoundly the relationship between inner space to outer space a bridge between mind and matter 2 according to donna haraway for as long as machines and technology have existed a love hate relationship has also existed between them and humanity haraway is at the forefront of this and dissects the interconnectedness of humans and technology she has written the cyborg manifesto which is a break down of her views of cyborgs and the route that humanity is toward that concept haraway is a self claimed cyborg a product of science and technology nothing special or different in the modern day and age humanity has become so woven in with technology that it is hard to tell where the line that divides them is this is especially apparent in medicine with the modifications we are now able to accomplish with modern science and technology as humans advance as a society haraway explains how all boundaries between humans animals and technology have been breached this breach leads to hybrids and more complexities every place that meets the eye there is some form of technology that humans need and depend on science and technology have evolved so far that we rely on them for every little task in our life there is somewhat of a cyborg age upon us just how haraway s world is filled with these tangled networks of humans and machines our bodies are networks in themselves it is not as natural as made out to be it is fed food kept alive on pharmaceuticals and altered through medical procedures haraway believes that in order to survive we need to get behind the complex nature of technoculture this article can also be viewed from a feminist lens throughout history women have always been told that they are naturally weak submissive and overemotional but if we are cyborgs as haraway says then all of us can be reconstructed and improved there exists the ability to construct your identity sexuality and all just as you please to do so since we have allowed and created machines and technology to be so advanced there should be no reason to fear what we have created cyborgs should be embraced because they are now part of human identities this being said it is important to empathize with both sides because only having one perspective can cause more harm than good 3 biosocial definition edit according to some definitions of the term the physical attachments that humans have with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs 4 in a typical example a human with an artificial cardiac pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator would be considered a cyborg since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body perform signal processing and can deliver electrical stimuli using this synthetic feedback mechanism to keep that person alive implants especially cochlear implants that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements some theorists who cite such modifications as contact lenses hearing aids smartphones or intraocular lenses as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities as cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists who argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging for instance a bio techno social definition of aging has been suggested 5 the term is also used to address human technology mixtures in the abstract this includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones computers the internet and so on but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology for example pen and paper and speech and language when augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places a person becomes capable of much more than they were before an example is a computer which gains power by using internet protocols to connect with other computers another example is a social media bot either a bot assisted human or a human assisted bot used to target social media with likes and shares 6 cybernetic technologies include highways pipes electrical wiring buildings electrical plants libraries and other infrastructure that people hardly notice but which are critical parts of the cybernetics that humans work within bruce sterling in his shaper mechanist universe suggested an idea of an alternative cyborg called lobster which is made not by using internal implants but by using an external shell e g a powered exoskeleton 7 unlike human cyborgs who appear human externally but are synthetic internally e g the bishop type in the alien franchise lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally such as in elysium and robocop the computer game deus ex invisible war prominently features cyborgs called omar russian for lobster visual appearance of fictional cyborgs edit this section does not cite any sources please

fiction cyborg with an afrofuturist aesthetic in science fiction the most stereotypical portrayal of a cyborg is a person or more rarely an animal with visible added mechanical parts these include the superhero cyborg from dc comics and the borg race from the star trek universe however cyborgs can also be portrayed as looking more robotic or more organic they may appear as humanoid robots such as robotman from dc s doom patrol or most varieties of the cybermen from doctor who they can appear as non humanoid robots such as the daleks again from doctor who or like the majority of the motorball players in battle angel alita and its prequel ashen victor more human appearing cyborgs may cover up their mechanical parts with armor or clothing such as darth vader star wars or misty knight marvel comics cyborgs may have mechanical parts or bodies that appear human for example the eponymous six million dollar man and the bionic woman from their respective television series have prostheses externally identical to the body parts that they replaced while major motoko kusanagi ghost in the shell is a full body cyborg whose body appears human in these examples among others it is common for cyborgs to have superhuman physical or mental abilities including great strength enhanced senses computer assisted brains or built in weaponry origins edit the concept of a man machine mixture was widespread in science fiction before world war ii as early as 1843 edgar allan poe described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story the man that was used up in 1911 jean de la hire introduced the nyctalope a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg in le mystère des xv later translated as the nyctalope on mars 8 9 10 nearly two decades later edmond hamilton presented space explorers with a mixture of organic and machine parts in his 1928 novel the comet doom he later featured the talking living brain of an old scientist simon wright floating around in a transparent case in all the adventures of his famous hero captain future in 1944 in the short story no woman born c l moore wrote of deirdre a dancer whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body in 1960 the term cyborg was coined by manfred e clynes and nathan s kline to refer to their conception of an enhanced human being who could survive in extraterrestrial environments 1 for the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously we propose the term cyborg their concept was the outcome of thinking about the need for an intimate relationship between human and machine as the new frontier of space exploration was beginning to open up a designer of physiological instrumentation and electronic data processing systems clynes was the chief research scientist in the dynamic simulation laboratory at rockland state hospital in new york the term first appears in print 5 months earlier when the new york times reported on the psychophysiological aspects of space flight symposium where clynes and kline first presented their paper a cyborg is essentially a man machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one 11 thereafter hamilton would first use the term cyborg explicitly in the 1962 short story after a judgment day to describe the mechanical analogs called charlies explaining that c yborgs they had been called from the first one in the 1960s cybernetic organisms in 2001 a book titled cyborg digital destiny and human possibility in the age of the wearable computer was published by doubleday 12 some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the documentary film cyberman that same year cyborg tissues in engineering edit cyborg tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses such work was presented by raffaele di giacomo bruno maresca and others at the materials research society s spring conference on 3 april 2013 13 the cyborg obtained was inexpensive light and had unique mechanical properties it could also be shaped in the desired forms cells combined with multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts co precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material likewise dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the mwcnt network when observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial tissue composed of highly packed cells the effect of cell drying was manifested by their ghost cell appearance a rather specific physical interaction between mwcnts and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall the outermost part of fungal and plant cells may play a major active role in establishing a carbon nanotube s network and its stabilization this novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing for instance using candida albicans cells a species of yeast that often lives inside the human gastrointestinal tract cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported 14 actual cyborgization attempts edit cyborg neil harbisson with his antenna implant in current prosthetic applications the c leg system developed by otto bock healthcare is used to replace a human leg that has been amputated because of injury or illness the use of sensors in the artificial c leg aids in walking significantly by attempting to replicate the user s natural gait as it would be prior to amputation 15 prostheses like the c leg and the more advanced ilimb are considered by some to be the first real steps towards the next generation of real world cyborg applications citation needed additionally cochlear implants and magnetic implants which provide people with a sense that they would not otherwise have had can additionally be thought of as creating cyborgs citation needed in vision science direct brain implants have been used to treat non congenital acquired blindness one of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was a private researcher william dobelle dobelle s first prototype was implanted into jerry a man blinded in adulthood in 1978 a single array bci containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto jerry s visual cortex and succeeded in producing phosphenes the sensation of seeing light the system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant initially the implant allowed jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame rate this also required him to be hooked up to a two ton mainframe but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted 16 in 1997 philip kennedy a scientist and physician created the world s first human cyborg from johnny ray a vietnam veteran who suffered a stroke ray s body as doctors called it was locked in ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to kennedy s experiment kennedy embedded an implant he designed and named a neurotrophic electrode near the injured part of ray s brain so that ray would be able to have some movement back in his body the surgery went successfully but in 2002 ray died 17 in 2002 canadian jens naumann also blinded in adulthood became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive dobelle s second generation implant marking one of the earliest commercial uses of bcis the second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry night effect immediately after his implant naumann was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute 18 in contrast to replacement technologies in 2002 under the heading project cyborg a british scientist kevin warwick had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet to investigate enhancement possibilities with this in place warwick successfully carried out a series of experiments including extending his nervous system over the internet to control a robotic hand also receiving feedback from the fingertips in order to control the hand s grip this was a form of extended sensory input subsequently he investigated ultrasonic input in order to remotely detect the distance to objects finally with electrodes also implanted into his wife s nervous system they conducted the first direct electronic communication experiment between the nervous systems of two humans 19 20 since 2004 british artist neil harbisson has had a cyborg antenna implanted in his head that allows him to extend his perception of colors beyond the human visual spectrum through vibrations in his skull 21 his antenna was included within his 2004 passport photograph which has been claimed to confirm his cyborg status 22 in 2012 at tedglobal 23 harbisson explained that he started to feel like a cyborg when he noticed that the software and his brain had united and given him an extra sense 23 neil harbisson is a co founder of the cyborg foundation 2004 24 and cofounded the transpecies society in 2017 which is an association that empowers individuals with non human identities and supports them in their decisions to develop unique senses and new organs 25 neil harbisson is a global advocate for the rights of cyborgs rob spence a toronto based filmmaker who titles himself a real life eyeborg severely damaged his right eye in a shooting accident on his grandfather s farm as a child 26 many years later in 2005 he decided to have his ever deteriorating and now technically blind eye surgically removed 27 whereafter he wore an eyepatch for some time before he later after having played for some time with the idea of installing a camera instead contacted professor steve mann at the massachusetts institute of technology an expert in wearable computing and cyborg technology 27 under mann s guidance spence at age 36 created a prototype in the form of the miniature camera which could be fitted inside his prosthetic eye an invention that would come to be named by time magazine as one of the best inventions of 2009 the bionic eye records everything he sees and contains a 1 5 mm2 low resolution video camera a small round printed circuit board a wireless video transmitter which allows him to transmit what he is seeing in real time to a computer and a 3 volt rechargeable varta microbattery the eye is not connected to his brain and has not restored his sense of vision additionally spence has also installed a laser like led light in one version of the prototype 28 furthermore many cyborgs with multifunctional radio frequency identification rfid microchips injected into a hand are known to exist with the chips they are able to swipe cards open or unlock doors operate devices such as printers or with some using cryptocurrency buy products such as drinks with a wave of the hand 29 30 31 32 33 bodynet edit bodynet is an application of human electronic interaction currently when in development by researchers from stanford university 34 the technology is based on stretchable semiconductor materials elastronic according to their article in nature the technology is composed of smart devices screens and a network of sensors that can be implanted into the body woven into the skin or worn as clothes it has been suggested that this platform can potentially replace the smartphone in the future 35 animal cyborgs edit see also brain implant research and applications remote control animal and in the military the us based company backyard brains released what they refer to as the world s first commercially available cyborg called the roboroach the project started as a senior design project for a university of michigan biomedical engineering student in 2010 36 and was launched as an available beta product on 25 february 2011 37 the roboroach was officially released into production via a ted talk at the ted global conference 38 and via the crowdsourcing website kickstarter in 2013 39 the kit allows students to use microstimulation to momentarily control the movements of a walking cockroach left and right using a bluetooth enabled smartphone as the controller other groups have developed cyborg insects including researchers at north carolina state university 40 41 uc berkeley 42 43 and nanyang technological university singapore 44 45 but the roboroach was the first kit available to the general public and was funded by the national institute of mental health as a device to serve as a teaching aid to promote an interest in neuroscience 38 several animal welfare organizations including the rspca 46 and peta 47 have expressed concerns about the ethics and welfare of animals in this project in the late 2010s scientists created cyborg jellyfish using a microelectronic prosthetic that propels the animal to swim almost three times faster while using just twice the metabolic energy of their unmodified peers the prosthetics can be removed without harming the jellyfish 48 practical applications edit this section possibly contains original research please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations statements consisting only of original research should be removed november 2007 learn how and when to remove this template message in medicine edit in medicine there are two important and different types of cyborgs the restorative and the enhanced restorative technologies restore lost function organs and limbs 49 the key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function there is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost on the contrary the enhanced cyborg follows a principle and it is the principle of optimal performance maximising output the information or modifications obtained and minimising input the energy expended in the process 50 thus the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present although prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely michael chorost wrote a memoir of his experience with cochlear implants or bionic ears titled rebuilt how becoming part computer made me more human 51 jesse sullivan became one of the first people to operate a fully robotic limb through a nerve muscle graft enabling him a complex range of motions beyond that of previous prosthetics 52 by 2004 a fully functioning artificial heart was developed 53 the continued technological development of bionic and nanotechnologies begins to raise the question of enhancement and of the future possibilities for cyborgs which surpass the original functionality of the biological model the ethics and desirability of enhancement prosthetics have been debated their proponents include the transhumanist movement with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present normative limitations such as aging and disease as well as other more general inabilities such as limitations on speed strength endurance and intelligence opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies namely a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood in favor of definition in terms of upgrades versions and utility 54 a brain computer interface or bci provides a direct path of communication from the brain to an external device effectively creating a cyborg research into invasive bcis which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people most notably those with severe cases such as locked in syndrome this technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aid them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices it is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people 55 deep brain stimulation is a neurological surgical procedure used for therapeutic purposes this process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with parkinson s disease alzheimer s disease tourette syndrome epilepsy chronic headaches and mental disorders after the patient is unconscious through anesthesia brain pacemakers or electrodes are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present the region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures like all invasive procedures deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk however there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment 56 retinal implants are another form of cyborgization in medicine the theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging conditions in which people have an abnormally low number of retinal ganglion cells is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells cells which connect the eye to the brain while work to perfect this technology is still being done there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light a specialized camera is worn by the subject such as on the frames of their glasses which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation a chip located in the user s eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user if technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them a similar process has been created to aid people who have lost their vocal cords this experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators the transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals the signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator that simulator would then vibrate producing a multi tonal sound that could be shaped into words by the mouth 57 an article published in nature materials in 2012 reported research on cyborg tissues engineered human tissues with embedded three dimensional mesh of nanoscale wires with possible medical implications 58 in 2014 researchers from the university of illinois at urbana champaign and washington university in st louis had developed a device that could keep a heart beating endlessly by using 3d printing and computer modeling these scientists developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers the device utilizes a spider web like network of sensors and electrodes to monitor and maintain a normal heart rate with electrical stimuli unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high resolution imaging technology the first prototype was created to fit a rabbit s heart operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient rich solution the stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by professor john a rogers in which the electrodes are arranged in an s shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard against heart attacks 59 automated insulin delivery systems colloquially also known as the artificial pancreas are a substitute for the lack of natural insulin production by the body most notably in type 1 diabetes currently available systems combine a continuous glucose monitor with an insulin pump that can be remote controlled forming a control loop that automatically adjusts the insulin dosage depending on the current blood glucose level examples of commercial systems that implement such a control loop are the minimed 670g from medtronic 60 and the t slim x2 from tandem diabetes care 61 do it yourself artificial pancreas technologies also exist though these are not verified or approved by any regulatory agency 62 upcoming next generation artificial pancreas technologies include automatic glucagon infusion in addition to insulin to help prevent hypoglycemia and improve efficiency one example of such a bi hormonal system is the beta bionics ilet 63 in the military edit see also animal cyborgs and supersoldier military organizations research has recently focused on the utilization of cyborg animals for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage darpa has announced its interest in developing cyborg insects to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupa stage the insect s motion would be controlled from a microelectromechanical system mems and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas 64 similarly darpa is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks the shark s unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives 65 in 2006 researchers at cornell university invented 66 a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development 67 68 the first insect cyborgs moths with integrated electronics in their thorax were demonstrated by the same researchers 69 70 the initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called hybrid insect mems hi mems its goal according to darpa s microsystems technology office is to develop tightly coupled machine insect interfaces by placing micro mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis 71 the use of neural implants has recently been attempted with success on cockroaches surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect which was remotely controlled by a human the results although sometimes different basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes darpa is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas 72 in 2009 at the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee mems conference in italy researchers demonstrated the first wireless flying beetle cyborg 73 engineers at the university of california berkeley have pioneered the design of a remote controlled beetle funded by the darpa hi mems program 74 this was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a lift assisted moth cyborg 75 eventually researchers plan to develop hi mems for dragonflies bees rats and pigeons 76 77 for the hi mems cybernetic bug to be considered a success it must fly 100 metres 330 ft from a starting point guided via computer into a controlled landing within 5 metres 16 ft of a specific end point once landed the cybernetic bug must remain in place 76 in 2020 an article published in science robotics 78 by researchers at the university of washington reported a mechanically steerable wireless camera attached to beetles 79 miniature cameras weighing 248 mg were attached to live beetles of the tenebrionid genera asbolus and eleodes the camera wirelessly streamed video to a smartphone via bluetooth for up to 6 hours and the user could remotely steer the camera to achieve a bug s eye view 80 in sports edit see also cybathlon and paralympic games in 2016 cybathlon became the first cyborg olympics celebrated in zurich switzerland it was the first worldwide and official celebration of cyborg sports in this event 16 teams of people with disabilities used technological developments to turn themselves into cyborg athletes there were 6 different events and its competitors used and controlled advanced technologies such as powered prosthetic legs and arms robotic exoskeletons bikes and motorized wheelchairs 81 this was already a remarkable improvement as it allowed disabled people to compete and showed the several technological enhancements that are already making a difference however it showed that there is still a long way to go for instance the exoskeleton race still required its participants to stand up from a chair and sit down navigate a slalom and other simple activities such as walking over stepping stones and climbing up and down stairs despite the simplicity of these activities 8 of the 16 teams that participated in the event drop off before the start 82 nonetheless one of the main goals of this event and such simple activities is to show how technological enhancements and advanced prosthetics can make a difference in people s lives the next cybathlon that was expected to occur in 2020 was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic in art edit cyborg artist moon ribas founder of the cyborg foundation performing with her seismic sense implant at ted 2016 the concept of the cyborg is often associated with science fiction however many artists have tried to create public awareness of cybernetic organisms these can range from paintings to installations some artists who create such works are neil harbisson moon ribas patricia piccinini steve mann orlan h r giger lee bul wafaa bilal tim hawkinson and stelarc stelarc is a performance artist who has visually probed and acoustically amplified his body he uses medical instruments prosthetics robotics virtual reality systems the internet and biotechnology to explore alternate intimate and involuntary interfaces with the body he has made three films of the inside of his body and has performed with a third hand and a virtual arm between 1976 and 1988 he completed 25 body suspension performances with hooks into the skin for third ear he surgically constructed an extra ear within his arm that was internet enabled making it a publicly accessible acoustical organ for people in other places 83 he is presently performing as his avatar from his second life site 84 tim hawkinson promotes the idea that bodies and machines are coming together as one where human features are combined with technology to create the cyborg hawkinson s piece emoter presented how society is now dependent on technology 85 wafaa bilal is an iraqi american performance artist who had a small 10 megapixel digital camera surgically implanted into the back of his head part of a project entitled 3rd i 86 for one year beginning 15 december 2010 an image was captured once per minute 24 hours a day and streamed live to www 3rdi me and the mathaf arab museum of modern art the site also displays bilal s location via gps bilal says that the reason why he put the camera in the back of the head was to make an allegorical statement about the things we don t see and leave behind 87 as a professor at nyu this project raised privacy issues and so bilal was asked to ensure that his camera did take photographs in nyu buildings 87 machines are becoming more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself with computerized drawing pads replacing pen and paper and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers composers such as brian eno have developed and utilized software that can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters 88 scott draves is a generative artist whose work is explicitly described as a cyborg mind his electric sheep project generates abstract art by combining the work of many computers and people over the internet 89 artists as cyborgs edit artists have explored the term cyborg from a perspective involving imagination some work to make an abstract idea of technological and human bodily union apparent to reality in an art form utilizing varying mediums from sculptures and drawings to digital renderings artists who seek to make cyborg based fantasies a reality often call themselves cyborg artists or may consider their artwork cyborg how an artist or their work may be considered cyborg will vary depending upon the interpreter s flexibility with the term scholars that rely upon a strict technical description of a cyborg often going by norbert wiener s cybernetic theory and manfred e clynes and nathan s kline s first use of the term would likely argue that most cyborg artists do not qualify to be considered cyborgs 90 scholars considering a more flexible description of cyborgs may argue it incorporates more than cybernetics 91 others may speak of defining subcategories or specialized cyborg types that qualify different levels of cyborg at which technology influences an individual this may range from technological instruments being external temporary and removable to being fully integrated and permanent 92 nonetheless cyborg artists are artists being so it can be expected for them to incorporate the cyborg idea rather than a strict technical representation of the term 93 seeing how their work will sometimes revolve around other purposes outside of cyborgism 90 in body modification edit as medical technology becomes more advanced some techniques and innovations are adopted by the body modification community while not yet cyborgs in the strict definition of manfred clynes and nathan kline technological developments like implantable silicon silk electronics 94 augmented reality 95 and qr codes 96 are bridging the disconnect between technology and the body hypothetical technologies such as digital tattoo interfaces 97 98 would blend body modification aesthetics with interactivity and functionality bringing a transhumanist way of life into present day reality in addition it is quite plausible for anxiety expression to manifest individuals may experience pre implantation feelings of fear and nervousness to this end individuals may also embody feelings of uneasiness particularly in a socialized setting due to their post operative technologically augmented bodies and mutual unfamiliarity with the mechanical insertion anxieties may be linked to notions of otherness or a cyborged identity 99 in space edit sending humans to space is a dangerous task in which the implementation of various cyborg technologies could be used in the future for risk mitigation 100 stephen hawking a renowned physicist stated life on earth is at the ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster such as sudden global warming nuclear war i think the human race has no future if it doesn t go into space the difficulties associated with space travel could mean it might be centuries before humans ever become a multi planet species citation needed there are many effects of spaceflight on the human body one major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen if this necessity was taken out of the equation space exploration would be revolutionized a theory proposed by manfred e clynes and nathan s kline is aimed at tackling this problem the two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is capable of reducing co2 to its components with the removal of the carbon and re circulation of the oxygen 101 could make breathing unnecessary another prominent issue is radiation exposure yearly the average human on earth is exposed to approximately 0 30 rem of radiation while an astronaut aboard the international space station for 90 days is exposed to 9 rem 102 to tackle the issue clynes and kline theorized a cyborg containing a sensor that would detect radiation levels and a rose osmotic pump which would automatically inject protective pharmaceuticals in appropriate doses experiments injecting these protective pharmaceuticals into monkeys have shown positive results in increasing radiation resistance 101 although the effects of spaceflight on our bodies are an important issue the advancement of propulsion technology is just as important with our current technology it would take us about 260 days to get to mars 103 a study backed by nasa proposes an interesting way to tackle this issue through deep sleep or torpor with this technique it would reduce astronauts metabolic functions with existing medical procedures 104 so far experiments have only resulted in patients being in torpor state for one week advancements to allow for longer states of deep sleep would lower the cost of the trip to mars as a result of reduced astronaut resource consumption in cognitive science edit theorists such as andy clark suggest that interactions between humans and technology result in the creation of a cyborg system in this model cyborg is defined as a part biological part mechanical system that results in the augmentation of the biological component and the creation of a more complex whole clark argues that this broadened definition is necessary to an understanding of human cognition he suggests that any tool which is used to offload part of a cognitive process may be considered the mechanical component of a cyborg system examples of this human and technology cyborg system can be very low tech and simplistic such as using a calculator to perform basic mathematical operations or pen and paper to make notes or as high tech as using a personal computer or phone according to clark these interactions between a person and a form of technology integrate that technology into the cognitive process in a way that is analogous to the way that a technology that would fit the traditional concept of cyborg augmentation becomes integrated with its biological host because all humans in some way use technology to augment their cognitive processes clark comes to the conclusion that we are natural born cyborgs 105 future scope and regulation of implantable technologies edit given the technical scope of current and future implantable sensory telemetric devices such devices will be greatly proliferated and will have connections to commercial medical and governmental networks for example in the medical sector patients will be able to log in to their home computer and thus visit virtual doctor s offices medical databases and receive medical prognoses from the comfort of their own home from the data collected through their implanted telemetric devices 106 however this online network presents huge security concerns because it has been proven by several u s universities that hackers could get onto these networks and shut down peoples electronic prosthetics 106 these sorts of technologies are already present in the u s workforce as a firm in river falls wisconsin called three square market partnered with a swedish firm biohacks technology to implant rfid microchips which are about the size of a grain of rice in the hands of its employees that allow employees to access offices computers and even vending machines more than 50 of the firm s 85 employees were chipped it was confirmed that the american food and drug administration approved of these implantations 107 if these devices are to be proliferated within society then the question that begs to be answered is what regulatory agency will oversee the operations monitoring and security of these devices according to this case study of three square market it seems that the fda is assuming a role in regulating and monitoring these devices it has been argued that a new regulatory framework needs to be developed so that the law keeps up with developments in implantable technologies 108 cyborg foundation edit in 2010 the cyborg foundation became the world s first international organization dedicated to help humans become cyborgs 109 the foundation was created by cyborg neil harbisson and moon ribas as a response to the growing number of letters and emails received from people around the world interested in becoming cyborgs 110 the foundation s main aims are to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extensions to the body 111 to promote the use of cybernetics in cultural events and to defend cyborg rights 112 in 2010 the foundation based in mataró barcelona was the overall winner of the cre tic awards organized by tecnocampus mataró 113 in 2012 spanish film director rafel duran torrent created a short film about the cyborg foundation in 2013 the film won the grand jury prize at the sundance film festival s focus forward filmmakers competition and was awarded us 100 000 114 in popular culture edit see also cyberpunk and list of fictional cyborgs cyborgs have become a well known part of science fiction literature and other media although many of these characters may be technically androids they are often erroneously referred to as cyborgs perhaps the best known examples of cyborgs in popular culture are the terminator characters from universal soldier film series and the daleks and cybermen from doctor who other prominent cyborgs include robocop evangelion united states air force colonel steve austin in both the novel cyborg and as acted out by lee majors the six million dollar man the replicants from blade runner the borg from star trek darth vader lobot and general grievous from star wars inspector gadget and the cylons from the 2004 battlestar galactica series from american comic books are characters including deathlok and victor cyborg stone and manga and anime characters including 8 man the inspiration for robocop kamen rider battle tendency s rudol von stroheim and ghost in the shell s motoko kusanagi player characters such as kano jax cyrax and sektor from the mortal kombat franchise 115 116 as well as genji an advanced cyborg ninja who appears in overwatch and heroes of the storm 117 are examples of cyborgs in video games the deus ex video game series deals extensively with the near future rise of cyborgs and their corporate ownership as does the syndicate series william gibson s neuromancer features one of the first female cyborgs a razorgirl named molly millions who has extensive cybernetic modifications and is one of the most prolific cyberpunk characters in the science fiction canon 118 the cyborg was also a central part of singer janelle monáe s 48 minute video corresponding with the release of her 2018 album dirty computer this emotion picture intertwined the relationship between human and technology highlighting the power of the digital on a futuristic dystopian society monáe has previously referred to herself as an android depicting herself as a mechanical organism often conforming to idealistic standards thus using the cyborg as a way to detach from these oppressive

superheroes unlike their predecessors wendy harris and marvin white this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own hanna barbera animator darrell mcneil recalls the twins were created by norman maurer the super friends series developer story editor they were originally called dick and jane and their sidekick was mighty monkey before finally becoming zan jayna and gleek the names zan and jayna derived from the edgar rice burroughs characters tarzan and his romantic interest jane according to mcneil originally zan dick had plastic man powers and jayna jane could transform into anything not just animals but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other super friends even superman seem almost superfluous 2 jayna s distinctive hairdo was based on that of an animation checker at hanna barbera while the pointed ears were inspired by the character spock from the star trek franchise the twins personalities were heavily based on donny and marie osmond who were extremely popular at the time and had their own show on abc as well 3 the wonder twins were the most prominently featured characters in their first season on super friends however by the final seasons the twins were largely marginalized in favor of well established dc comics teenage superheroes like firestorm and were wholly eliminated in the final season in favor of cyborg 3 the characters were introduced to comics in issue 7 of the super friends tie in series cover dated october 1977 but published in july 1977 by e nelson bridwell and ramona fradon the super friends comic book provided considerably more details of the wonder twins background and how they came to join the team than was provided in the television series because of the different production lag times between animation and comics the first comic book appearance is chronologically before the first television appearance 3 in the 1990s they were introduced into the main dc universe in extreme justice 9 october 1995 by ivan velez jr and al rio the series rewrote and updated their origin story velez an avowed die hard fan of the wonder twins intended to begin a revival of the characters but was taken off the series after the first issue with the wonder twins though the twins remained with the series until its cancellation with 18 they were used only sparingly after velez s departure 3 following the cancellation of extreme justice the wonder twins showed up only sporadically in the dc universe with their last significant appearance being in 2003 dc published a six issue wonder twins miniseries in 2019 written by mark russell and drawn by stephen byrne 4 the series was a critical and commercial success and was extended into a 12 issue maxi series in november 2019 the first 6 issues of wonder twins were collected as a trade paper back and released under the title wonder twins activate in the following august the second six issues of the maxi series are being released in another trade paper back titled the fall rise of the wonder twins fictional character biography edit super friends edit little background is provided for the wonder twins in the super friends cartoon save that they are superheroes in training that are friends of the super friends and were born on november 6 according to the 1977 super friends comic book by writer e nelson bridwell and artist ramona fradon zan and jayna are exorian the twins are metas genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of exorian shapeshifters 5 their parents died when they were still babies during a plague and because of their origin no exorians want to adopt them they are adopted by the owner of a space circus who only wants to use them as sideshow freaks however the circus clown or laugh maker is a kind man and raises them he also gives them gleek as a pet eventually as teens the pair escapes the circus and hides on a planet where a space villain called grax an enemy of superman has established his headquarters spying on him they learn that grax is planning to destroy the earth using hidden superbombs the twins decide to travel to earth and warn the justice league which is how they come to replace wendy and marvin who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway as their sidekicks the heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named professor carter nichols and they even take secret identities as johan and joanna fleming johan and johanna were supposedly transfer students from esko sweden disguised with blonde hair zan wore a wig while jayna used her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape to allow them to attend gotham city high school citation needed according to the twins self titled 2019 series zan is older by three minutes 6 in comics edit the new revamped wonder twins art by todd nauck in 1996 the twins were introduced into post crisis dc continuity in the series extreme justice as escaped slaves of an alien overlord unable to speak english they inadvertently attack some civilians and the justice league during their fight with the jla zan becomes an ice golem a water monster and a demonic looking whirlpool while jayna becomes a griffin a werewolf and a sea serpent 7 the pair are later emancipated by the justice league and join captain atom s team in issue 16 may 1996 8 that same year they appeared in the crossover storyline final night 9 and in the series total justice 10 in a 2002 2003 storyline by peter david and todd nauck in young justice they help avenge the murder of empress

smallville season 11 zan and jayna are members of the team with conner kent superboy speedy blue beetle and miss martian at jay garrick s school for the gifted 12 in the 2013 comic justice league 3000 the handlers of the new justice league who work for cadmus labs were introduced named teri and terry and nicknamed the wonder twins in superpowers a 2017 backup series in cave carson has a cybernetic eye cartoonist tom scioli offers a slightly different version of the origin of the wonder twins set on an alternate earth 13 in february 2019 the first issue of a 6 issue mini series was released on wonder comics titled wonder twins it was well received and did so well in sales that it was expanded to a 12 issue maxi series the wonder comics imprint is considered part of the current dcu so this places the wonder twins in current dc continuity later in september the wonder twins had a cameo appearance in action comics 1015 which also guest starred new wonder comics hero naomi wonder comics

out of reach of each other they are unable to activate their powers as they are about to transform they would each announce their intended form shape of form of zan can transform into water at any state solid liquid gas and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area in the case of becoming solid ice he can also become any form he chooses from a 5 000 foot 1 500 m humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery such as a jet engine as he did in the episode eruption in the episode pressure point he changes into a gelatinous form in terror from the phantom zone he was able to transform into liquid nitrogen in addition he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances usually very localized involving water such as a blizzard a monsoon waterspout or a typhoon as he did in the episodes the water beast the beasts are coming and stowaways jayna can transform into any animal whether real mythological indigenous to earth or indigenous to some other planet like exxor since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume she must know the common name as revealed in the mummy of nazca naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal s form she has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale as in the water beast episode in the super friends comic book their powers were shown to be more extensive by transforming into an animal of kryptonian origin for instance jayna could gain both the creature s natural abilities and the super powers that all kryptonians possess under earth like conditions she was even capable of overpowering superman in the form of a kryptonian animal 14 similarly zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice including a frost giant in the demons of exxor episode in addition to their powers of transformation the two share a telepathic link enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances as revealed in the episode the village of lost souls the wonder twins have a pet space monkey named gleek who has a useful prehensile tail and who can act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach gleek also serves as a courier when the twins need to travel jayna will typically transform into a large eagle and zan will transform into water jumping into a bucket which gleek will hold while being clutched by jayna in her eagle form a rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control on at least two occasions pied piper from space and circus of horrors while the twins were under the influence of mind control gleek caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control in other media edit television edit david gallagher as zan and allison scagliotti as jayna in the smallville episode idol in the justice league episode injustice for all statues of the twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super powered heroes later in the same scene the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains in justice league unlimited two characters called downpour and shifter appear in the episode ultimatum where they were both voiced by grey delisle they are members of the ultimen a group of superheroes created by the government and project cadmus with maxwell lord as their sponsor the group is an analogue of the heroes that were created for super friends with downpour and shifter specifically an analogue of the wonder twins downpour and his twin sister shifter

greek χρόνος kʰrónos time also spelled khronos or chronus is a personification of time in pre socratic philosophy and later literature 1 chronos is frequently confused with or perhaps consciously identified with the titan cronus in antiquity due to the similarity in names 2 the identification became more widespread during the renaissance giving rise to the iconography of father time wielding the harvesting scythe 3 greco roman mosaics depicted chronos as a man turning the zodiac wheel 4 he is comparable to the deity aion as a symbol of cyclical time 5 he is usually portrayed as an old callous man with a thick grey beard personifying the destructive and stifling aspects of time 6 contents 1 name 2 mythology 3 notes 4 references name edit chronos and his child by giovanni francesco romanelli national museum in warsaw a 17th century depiction of titan cronus as father time wielding a harvesting scythe during antiquity chronos was occasionally interpreted as cronus 7 according to plutarch the greeks believed that cronus was an allegorical name for chronos 8 mythology edit in the orphic tradition the unaging chronos was engendered by earth and water and produced aether chaos and an egg 9 the egg produced the hermaphroditic god phanes who gave birth to the first generation of gods and is the ultimate creator of the cosmos pherecydes of syros in his lost heptamychos the seven recesses around 6th century bc claimed that there were three eternal principles chronos zas zeus and chthonie the chthonic the semen of chronos was placed in the recesses of the earth and

director irwin donenfeld held a meeting with editors jack schiff and julius schwartz in his office asking them each to create a new science fiction hero one from the present and one from the future given first pick schiff chose to create one from the future space ranger schwartz was happy with the pick feeling that readers would more readily identify with a hero from the present 2 he conceived the idea of an earth man repeatedly traveling to a planet in the alpha centauri star system by using a zeta beam altered by space radiation 3 since adam strange was the first earthman on another planet he named his character adam after the biblical first man 4 adam strange debuted in issues 17 19 of the tryout series showcase published november 1958 march 1959 the first artwork of the character was a cover for showcase 17 by murphy anderson schwartz rejected the drawing and commissioned a new one by gil kane though anderson s costume design was retained 4 schwartz then assigned the scribing of the stories to gardner fox and the penciling to mike sekowsky 5 schwartz and fox devised the plots for the stories in schwartz s office and fox would write the scripts at home a science major schwartz specialized in giving fox scientific pointers that gave the adam strange tales a plausibility that made them stand out from most science fiction comic books of the time 4 sales on the three issue showcase tryout were enough to justify giving adam strange a slot in mystery in space which ran in issues 53 100 and 102 though schwartz and fox continued their work on the character schwartz gave the penciler assignment to carmine infantino instead of sekowsky most issues were inked by murphy anderson although bernard sachs joe giella and sid greene did a few issues each in the justice league of america comic book the flash mentioned adam strange as a possible new member for the justice league when a letter to the editor pointed out the group had not met adam strange and could not have heard of him as all his heroics took place on rann schwartz and fox wrote a story showing how the justice league came to rann and how adam strange saved them from kanjar ro the story

new family into the wilds of their homeworld to study and rediscover its ancient history 16 eventually his experiences accumulated on his adventures through the study and understanding of both rannian

defeat immeasurably more imposing opponents over the many years he has battled and bested adversaries both native and extraterrestrial in nature such as thanagarians durlans qwardians en tarans and meta humans 17 18 19 20 this along with his many decades of thriving in the harsh environments of rann earth and other galactic territories has made adam an accomplished survivalist 21 having spent

munitions armor gadgets utensils or cutting edge genetics engineering strange is also well versed in their mechanical function as well as practical use in his heroic endeavors 27 space suit edit strange is an adept aerial combatant often making use of a fireproof thermal insulated and environmentally adapted suit with which to traverse the terrains of foreign worlds or in the cold depths of

his handheld blaster sporting real time threat assessment and targeting priority reticules to better combat adversaries 28 the jetpack is a twin engine propulsion system attached to a harness adorning his back capable of aerial aviation for an undisclosed amount of time 30 strange is also versed in other kinds of rocket propulsion equipment like a booster system with hidden back up blasters with his equipment strange can also make escape velocity in order to break planetary orbit 31 alien arsenal edit adam strange s primary weapon of choice is a rannian laser pistol among other assorted weapons and munitions picked up from across the galaxy he is a crack marksman with just about any ranged weapon on hand at the time the gun comes with a targeting system conductor when worked in tandem with his costume and has a stun setting for non lethal application other munitions in his arsenal include holo blasters which are hard light energy arms that strange can use to conjure any number of ordinance or enhanced protective shielding with while in a firefight 32 the effectiveness of these armaments makes them potent enough in dispatching smite one of starro s lieutenants boasting physical capabilities rivalling superman or lobo 33 when properly calibrated by outside forces these energy weapons can also channel the light of a power ring or a facsimile of its corresponding emotion that can dispatch a small enclave of black lanterns 34 zeta beamer apparatus edit one of strange s as well as the planet of rann s greatest resource is the zeta beam technology developed by sardeth initially designed as a means of communications with intelligent life from across the universe it was accidentally discovered to be an instantaneous means of intergalactic transport that rode along a cosmic radiation called zeta rays 16 the effects of the ray were always short lived and their dissipation meant adam would return to where he first intercepted the ray this would be a running staple for years until later zeta designs made its effects permanent albeit at the cost debilitating mental sickness for its user 35 eventual innovations in rannian transport technology would produce a more streamlined device called the zeta beamer module an a i commanded mobile drone in the form of a floating sphere that could be used to track zeta rays across galaxies and even into alternate universes 36 like the mega zeta beam transport was also permanent without the danger of zeta ray sickness further modifications integrated the transport device into adam s space suit 37 other versions edit just imagine edit in just imagine created by stan lee adam strange is the superpowered teenage son of the villainous reverend dominic darrk and morgan morgan le fey

biography edit originally eclipso was written as a generic villain with average superpowers who would routinely enact an elaborate plot to fulfill his hedonistic motivations however the 1992 darkness within miniseries modified the character to be an evil and megalomaniacal entity eclipso s character laments the power he once had as a spirit of divine vengeance eclipso would frequently seek to possess beings of incredible power like superman lar gand and captain marvel to achieve his ends bruce gordon edit eclipso s early comics debut is tied to his first modern host bruce gordon named after bruce wayne and commissioner gordon as an inside joke 5 a scientist specializing in solar energy while in the jungle to view a solar eclipse gordon was attacked by a tribal sorcerer named mophir before plunging to his death off a cliff mophir wounded gordon with a black diamond afterwards gordon transformed into the villainous eclipso whenever an eclipse occurred a blue gray or purple circle covered the rightmost two thirds of his face resembling a partial eclipse 6 gordon experienced many jekyll and hyde transformations and misadventures in the house of secrets during this period eclipso was portrayed as a conventional villain possessing super strength partial invulnerability and eye blasts aided by his black diamond eclipso s transformations were later altered so that any type of natural eclipse lunar or solar would cause eclipso and gordon to split from one another while an artificial eclipse an object blocking out a light source would merely transform gordon to eclipso any bright flash of light would banish eclipso back into bruce gordon s body or reverse the change 7 eclipso the darkness within edit main article eclipso the darkness within wonder woman possessed by eclipso art by joe quesada in the early 1990s dc retconned eclipso in a company wide crossover built around the miniseries eclipso the darkness within eclipso was revealed not simply to be bruce gordon s dark half but a vengeance demon who had possessed gordon eclipso s soul had originally been bound inside a giant black diamond called the heart of darkness in africa a treasure hunter found it in the late 19th century and brought it to london in 1891 where he had a jeweler cut it into 1 000 shards this weakened the binding spell allowing eclipso to possess anyone who became angry while in contact with one of the shards he was no longer limited to possessing gordon during an eclipse but pretended otherwise so that gordon would not know the truth about the black diamonds 3 over the next 100 years the eclipso entity gathered the diamond shards with the intention of destroying them all freeing his true power when lar gand discovered eclipso s palace on the moon and wandered inside it inspired eclipso to possess all of earth s heroes and use them towards his ultimate goal the conquest of earth and revenge against god for imprisoning him inside the heart of darkness eclipso claimed he had spent the last several years posing as a b level villain in order to remain undetected by earth s heroes and had limited himself to targeting gordon for the purpose of quashing gordon s research into solar science if gordon had achieved his goal of making solar energy the planet s primary energy source any solar powered device could be used as a weapon against eclipso in the climax of the story several of earth s heroes were possessed by eclipso and transported to the moon during an eclipse he then absorbed these heroes into his own body gaining their mass and also their inherent powers gordon led a group of heroes armed with solar weapons to the moon in an attempt to defeat eclipso once and for all the absorbed heroes were freed in the end but only after will payton destroyed eclipso s moon base by detonating his own solar powered body eclipso s diamond shards however remained on earth eclipso series edit following the crossover event eclipso appeared in a solo series he conquered the south american country of parador by possessing one person at a time the united states sent an investigation team consisting of cave carson bruce gordon and gordon s fiancé mona bennet carson s legs were broken and he was left at the border gordon and bennet were taken on a tour and shown various atrocities such as piles of children s corpses they escaped with the assistance of the creeper and formed a group of heroes dubbed the shadow fighters this group was led by amanda waller formerly of the suicide squad in issue 13 of the series eclipso defeated them killing wildcat ii the second doctor mid nite the creeper commander steel the manhunter iv a mark shaw ringer and major victory the creeper has returned to action in his own series 3 the peacemaker was also involved in this action he died in a helicopter crash while trying to destroy eclipso s tanks these tanks were attacking the sole surviving member of the shadow fighter attack force nemesis the other survivors of the shadow fighters those who had not attacked eclipso directly regrouped eclipso attacked them with a parador missile which they evaded using nightshade s teleportation ability during the escape mona s father was snatched from their vehicle but he later returned alive the survivors arrived in the united nations building just in time to foil another plot of eclipso by landing their vehicle on his intended victim bruce gordon and mona bennet led earth s superheroes in an attack on parador in an attempt to destroy eclipso once and for all eclipso revealed that he dares not kill gordon and bennet because their unborn child will time travel to the past as an adult and free eclipso from the diamond eclipso was finally defeated when the phantom stranger gathered all 1 000 black diamond shards and fused them back together into the heart of darkness imprisoning eclipso again his physical body the adult child of bennet and gordon evaporated in front of his parents the spectre vol 3 edit later in the 1990s the series the spectre vol 3 gave key revelations about eclipso the spectre was not the first embodiment of the wrath of god but was eclipso s replacement series writer john ostrander chose to portray this as a distinction between the spectre s pursuit of vengeance and eclipso s pursuit of revenge in a biblical context eclipso was responsible for noah s flood while the spectre was the angel of death who slew the first born egyptian children the spectre destroys the heart of darkness along with the remains of eclipso s palace on the moon burning them to ash with the holy power of god and casting the ashes into outer space alex montez edit alex montez as eclipso art by john watson eclipso returns after several years absence in the princes of darkness storyline in jsa as an ally of the other villains mordru and obsidian alexander montez cousin of wildcat ii vows revenge on eclipso for her death to this end he gathers the 1 000 black diamonds liquefies them and injects them into himself all save one which he keeps to evoke eclipso exactly how eclipso s diamonds had returned was unknown montez covers his body in tribal tattoos he claims he had learned about on diablo island with these tattoos montez can summon all the powers of eclipso by triggering the diamond with his anger while remaining in control of himself and keeping eclipso trapped within as the new eclipso he joins the short lived team of loose cannon heroes assembled by black adam which was the subject of the subsequent storyline black reign during adam s reign in kahndaq alex becomes romantically involved with his teammate soseh mykros the female nemesis during the battle one of alex s binding glyphs which keeps eclipso in control is broken via a shoulder wound eclipso soon kills nemesis alex commits suicide in order to prevent eclipso from controlling him further this story was significant as it meant that eclipso no longer had a limitless number of black diamonds waiting out in the world for him to utilize this incarnation of eclipso was never shown using any power but his eye blasts in countdown to mystery 4 alex s body is acquired by eclipso s followers for an as yet unknown magic ritual in issue 6 all of the black diamond fragments in his body are recombined into their original form lightning strikes twice edit despite the loss of the other black diamonds the disembodied eclipso then tries to possess superman by antagonizing him through many deaths 8 he eventually possesses superman by upsetting him via his possession of lois lane 9 at this point the wizard shazam steps in by sending captain marvel to fight the possessed eclipso superman thanks to superman s weakness to magic captain marvel is able to do a significant amount of damage to eclipso a prominent method of attack he uses is to continuously trigger his transformations in close proximity to superman resulting in the lightning striking eclipso 10 eventually shazam himself removes eclipso from superman by calling upon the hostless spectre himself to do it the spectre forces eclipso back into a lone black diamond the spectre then warns shazam that he has made an enemy of eclipso and that the currently hostless spectre will no longer be able to defend him as he lacks the coherence necessary to effectively recall anything beyond his mission at the end of this series the black diamond is seen appearing in jean loring s cell in arkham asylum 10 jean loring edit jean loring as eclipso art by justiniano main article jean loring in the day of vengeance miniseries which tied into the infinite crisis event jean loring ex wife of the atom ray palmer and murderer of sue dibny as seen in the identity crisis miniseries discovers the last black diamond in her prison cell becomes the new eclipso and tricks the spectre into attacking magic based heroes as her revenge against shazam who was eventually slain while fighting the spectre after fending off multiple attacks upon herself eclipso loring was eventually teleported to a non decaying orbit around the sun by nightshade in the pages of infinite crisis it was revealed by alexander luthor jr that he had sent superboy prime to recover the black diamond and that the psycho pirate delivered it to loring on alex s orders and manipulated eclipso into manipulating the spectre this was all done in the interest of breaking down magic into raw magical energy which alexander could use for his own ends the death of shazam was particularly useful as his various champions then became a tether of power all alex had to do was capture one of them make them say shazam and they would summon their lightning bolt to power his machine in week 27 of 52 ralph dibny on a quest to restore his wife sue to life and guided by the helmet of doctor fate approaches the spectre and promises to fulfill any bargain that the spectre demands in order to restore his wife to life the spectre desiring revenge on eclipso for his manipulations of him during the infinite crisis but rendered incapable of taking it owing to his present lack of a host orders dibny to punish eclipso in return for his wife s life dibny realizing that this meant punishing jean loring his wife s murderer and temporarily granted the power of the spectre takes eclipso back to the point at which she as jean loring murdered his wife and restoring jean s sanity ruthlessly intends to trap her in a permanent time loop and force her to watch herself murder sue dibny over and over for all eternity her sanity restored and eclipso purged out of her a terrified loring tearfully begs for forgiveness screaming that she was crazy when she murdered sue and that it wasn t me dibny affected by her pleas his sense of compassion and his

firestorm is a conflagration which attains such intensity that it creates and sustains its own wind system it is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires although the term has been used to describe certain large fires 1 the phenomenon s determining characteristic is a fire with its own storm force winds from every point of the compass towards the storm s center where the air is heated and then ascends 2 3 the black saturday bushfires and the great peshtigo fire are possible examples of forest fires with some portion of combustion due to a firestorm as is the great hinckley fire firestorms have also occurred in cities usually due to targeted explosives such as in the aerial firebombings of hamburg dresden and tokyo and the atomic

column firestorm schematic 1 fire 2 updraft 3 strong gusty winds a pyrocumulonimbus cloud a firestorm after the bombing of hiroshima a firestorm is created as a result of the stack effect as the heat of the original fire draws in more and more of the surrounding air this draft can be quickly increased if a low level jet stream exists over or near the fire as the updraft mushrooms strong inwardly directed gusty winds develop around the fire supplying it with additional air this would seem to prevent the firestorm from spreading on the wind but the tremendous turbulence created may also cause the strong surface inflow winds to change direction erratically firestorms resulting from the bombardment of urban areas in the second world war were generally confined to the areas initially seeded with incendiary devices and the firestorm did not appreciably spread outward 4 a firestorm may also develop into a mesocyclone and induce true tornadoes fire whirls this occurred with the 2002 durango fire 5 and probably with the much greater peshtigo fire 6 7 the greater draft of a firestorm draws in greater quantities of oxygen which significantly increases combustion thereby also substantially increasing the production of heat the intense heat of a firestorm manifests largely as radiated heat infrared radiation which may ignite flammable material at a distance ahead of the fire itself 8 9 failed verification this also serves to expand the area and the intensity of the firestorm failed verification violent erratic wind drafts suck movables into the fire and as is observed with all intense conflagrations radiated heat from the fire can melt asphalt some metals and glass and turn street tarmac into flammable hot liquid the very high temperatures ignite anything that might possibly burn until the firestorm runs low on fuel a firestorm does not appreciably ignite material at a distance ahead of itself more accurately the heat desiccates those materials and makes them more vulnerable to ignition by embers or firebrands increasing the rate of fire spotting during the formation of a firestorm many fires merge to form a single convective column of hot gases rising from the burning area and strong fire induced radial inwardly directed winds are associated with the convective column thus the fire front is essentially stationary and the outward spread of fire is prevented by the in rushing wind 10 characterization of a firestorm edit a firestorm is characterized by strong to gale force winds blowing toward the fire everywhere around the fire perimeter an effect which is caused by the buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense mass fire drawing in cool air from the periphery these winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult thus limiting fire spread 4 at hiroshima this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast 11 a picture of a pyro cumulonimbus taken from a commercial airliner cruising at about 10 km in 2002 various sensing instruments detected 17 distinct pyrocumulonimbus cloud events in north america alone 12 large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms this does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary as with any other convective storm the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources furthermore non firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area 13 with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the kuwaiti oil fires of 1991 where the distance between individual fires was too large the high temperatures within the firestorm zone ignite most everything that might possibly burn until a tipping point is reached that is upon running low on fuel which occurs after the firestorm has consumed so much of the available fuel within the firestorm zone that the necessary fuel density required to keep the firestorm s wind system active drops below the threshold level at which time the firestorm breaks up into isolated conflagrations in australia the prevalence of eucalyptus trees that have oil in their leaves results in forest fires that are noted for their extremely tall and intense flame front hence the bush fires appear more as a firestorm than a simple forest fire sometimes emission of combustible gases from swamps e g methane has a similar effect for instance methane explosions enforced the peshtigo fire 6 14 weather and climate effects edit firestorms will produce hot buoyant smoke clouds of primarily water vapor that will form condensation clouds as it enters the cooler upper atmosphere generating what is known as pyrocumulus clouds fire clouds or if large enough pyrocumulonimbus fire storm clouds for example the black rain that began to fall approximately 20 minutes after the atomic bombing of hiroshima produced in total 5 10 cm of black soot filled rain in a 1 3 hour period 15 moreover if the conditions are right a large pyrocumulus can grow into a pyrocumulonimbus and produce lightning which could potentially set off further fires apart from city and forest fires pyrocumulus clouds can also be produced by volcanic eruptions due to the comparable amounts of hot buoyant material formed on a more continental and global extent away from the direct vicinity of the fire wildfire firestorms that produce pyrocumulonimbus cloud events have been found to surprisingly frequently generate minor nuclear winter effects 16 12 17 18 these are analogous to minor volcanic winters with each mass addition of volcanic gases additive in increasing the depth of the winter cooling from near imperceptible to year without a summer levels pyro cumulonimbus and atmospheric effects in wildfires edit a very important but poorly understood aspect of wildfire behavior are pyrocumulonimbus pyrocb firestorm dynamics and their atmospheric impact these are well illustrated in the black saturday case study below the pyrocb is a fire started or fire augmented thunderstorm that in its most extreme manifestation injects huge abundances of smoke and other biomass burning emissions into the lower stratosphere the observed hemispheric spread of smoke and other biomass burning emissions has known important climate consequences direct attribution of the stratospheric aerosols to pyrocbs only occurred in the last decade 19 such an extreme injection by thunderstorms was previously judged to be unlikely because the extratropical tropopause is considered to be a strong barrier to convection two recurring themes have developed as pyrocb research unfolds first puzzling stratospheric aerosol layer observations and other layers reported as volcanic aerosol can now be explained in terms of pyroconvection second pyrocb events occur surprisingly frequently and they are likely a relevant aspect of several historic wildfires 19 on an intraseasonal level it is established that pyrocbs occur with surprising frequency in 2002 at least 17 pyrocbs erupted in north america alone still to be determined is how often this process occurred in the boreal forests of asia in 2002 however it is now established that this most extreme form of pyroconvection along with more frequent pyrocumulus convection was widespread and persisted for at least two months the characteristic injection height of pyrocb emissions is the upper troposphere and a subset of these storms pollutes the lower stratosphere thus a new appreciation for the role of extreme wildfire behavior and its atmospheric ramifications is now coming into focus 19 black saturday firestorm wildfire case study edit see also black saturday bushfires background edit the black saturday bushfires are some of australia s most destructive and deadly fires that fall under the category of a firestorm due to the extreme fire behavior and relationship with atmospheric responses that occurred during the fires this major wildfire event led to a number of distinct electrified pyrocumulonimbus plume clusters ranging roughly 15 km high these plumes were proven susceptible to striking new spot fires ahead of the main fire front the newly ignited fires by this pyrogenic lightning further highlights the feedback loops of influence between the atmosphere and fire behavior on black saturday associated with these pyroconvective processes 20 role that pyrocbs have on fire in case study edit the examinations presented here for black saturday demonstrate that fires ignited by lightning generated within the fire plume can occur at much larger distances ahead of the main fire front of up to 100 km in comparison to fires ignited by burning debris transported by the fire plume these only go ahead of the fire front up to about 33 km noting that this also has implications in relation to understanding the maximum rate of spread of a wildfire this finding is important for the understanding and modeling of future firestorms and the large scale areas that can be affected by this phenomenon 20 as the individual spot fires grow together they will begin to interact this interaction will increase the burning rates heat release rates and flame height until the distance between them reaches a critical level at the critical separation distance the flames will begin to merge and burn with the maximum rate and flame height as these spot fires continue to grow together the burning and heat release rates will finally start to decrease but remain at a much elevated level compared to the independent spot fire the flame height is not expected to change significantly the more spot fires the bigger the increase in burning rate and flame height 21 importance for continued study of these firestorms edit black saturday is just one of many varieties of firestorms with these pyroconvective processes and they are still being widely studied and compared in addition to indicating this strong coupling on black saturday between the atmosphere and the fire activity the lightning observations also suggest considerable differences in pyrocb characteristics between black saturday and the canberra fire event differences between pyrocb events such as for the black saturday and canberra cases indicate considerable potential for improved understanding of pyroconvection based on combining different data sets as presented in the research of the black saturday pyrocb s including in relation to lightning radar precipitation and satellite observations 20 a greater understanding of pyrocb activity is important given that fire atmosphere feedback processes can exacerbate the conditions associated with dangerous fire behavior additionally understanding the combined effects of heat moisture and aerosols on cloud microphysics is important for a range of weather and climate processes including in relation to improved modeling and prediction capabilities it is essential to fully explore events such as these to properly characterize the fire behavior pyrocb dynamics and resultant influence on conditions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere utls it is also important to accurately characterize this transport process so that cloud chemistry and climate models have a firm basis on which to evaluate the pyrogenic source term pathway from the boundary layer through cumulus cloud and exhaust from the convective column 20 since the discovery of smoke in the stratosphere and the pyrocb only a small number of individual case studies and modeling experiments have been performed hence there is still much to be learned about the pyrocb and its importance with this work scientists have attempted to reduce the unknowns by revealing several additional occasions when pyrocbs were either a significant or sole cause for the type of stratospheric pollution usually attributed to volcanic injections 19 city firestorms edit joseph pennell s 1918 prophetic liberty bond poster calls up the pictorial image of a destroyed new york city totally engulfed in a firestorm at the time the armaments available to the world s various air forces were not powerful enough to produce such a result the same underlying combustion physics can also apply to man made structures such as cities during war or natural disaster firestorms are thought to have been part of the mechanism of large urban fires such as accompanied the 1755 lisbon earthquake the 1906 san francisco earthquake and the 1923 great kantō earthquake genuine firestorms are occurring more frequently in california wildfires such as the 1991 wildfire disaster in oakland california and the october 2017 tubbs fire in santa rosa california 22 during the july august 2018 carr fire a deadly fire vortex equivalent in size and strength to an ef 3 tornado spawned during the firestorm in redding california and caused tornado like wind damage 23 24 another wildfire which may be characterized as a firestorm was the camp fire which at one point travelled at a speed of up to 76 acres per minute completely destroying the town of paradise california within 24 hours on november 8 2018 25 firestorms were also created by the firebombing raids of world war ii in cities like hamburg and dresden 26 of the two nuclear weapons used in combat only hiroshima resulted in a firestorm 1 in contrast experts suggest that due to the nature of modern u s city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely after a nuclear detonation 27 city event date of the firestorm notes bombing of hamburg in world war ii germany 26 27 july 1943 46 000 dead 28 a firestorm area of approximately 4 5 square miles 12 km2 was reported at hamburg 29 bombing of kassel in world war ii germany 22 october 1943 9 000 dead 24 000 dwellings destroyed area burned 23 square miles 60 km2 the percentage of this area which was destroyed by conventional conflagration and that destroyed by firestorm is unspecified 30 although a much larger area was destroyed by fire in kassel than even tokyo and hamburg the city fire caused a smaller less extensive firestorm than that at hamburg 31 bombing of darmstadt in world war ii germany 11 september 1944 8 000 dead area destroyed by fire 4 square miles 10 km2 again the percentage of this which was done by firestorm remains unspecified 20 000 dwellings and one chemical works destroyed and industrial production reduced 30 bombing of dresden in world war ii germany 26 13 14 february 1945 up to 25 000 dead 32 a firestorm area of approximately 8 square miles 21 km2 was reported at dresden 29 the attack was centered on the readily identifiable ostragehege sports stadium 33 bombing of tokyo in world war ii japan 9 10 march 1945 the firebombing of tokyo started many fires which converged into a devastating conflagration covering 16 square miles 41 km2 although often described as a firestorm event 34 35 the conflagration did not generate a firestorm as the high prevailing surface winds gusting at 17 to 28 mph 27 to 45 km h at the time of the fire overrode the fire s ability to form its own wind system 36 these high winds increased by about 50 the damage done by the incendiary bombs 37 there were 267 171 buildings destroyed and between 83 793 38 and 100 000 killed 39 making this the most lethal air raid in history with destruction to life and property greater than that caused by the use of nuclear weapons on hiroshima and nagasaki 40 41 prior to the attack the city had the highest population density of any industrial city in the world 42 bombing of ube yamaguchi in world war ii japan 1 july 1945 a momentary firestorm of about 0 5 square miles 1 3 km2 was reported at ube japan 29 the reports that the ube bombing produced a firestorm along with computer modelling citation needed have set one of the four physical conditions which a city fire must meet to have the potential of developing true firestorm effects as the size of the ube firestorm is the smallest ever confirmed glasstone and dolan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop no 4 a minimum burning area of about 0 5 square miles 1 3 km2 glasstone and dolan 1977 43 atomic bombing of hiroshima in world war ii japan 6 august 1945 firestorm covering 4 4 square miles 11 km2 44 no estimate can be given of the number of fire deaths for the fire area was largely within the blast damage region 45 firebombing edit braunschweig burning after aerial firebombing attack in 1944 notice that a firestorm event has yet to develop in this picture as single isolated fires are seen burning and not the single large mass fire that is the identifying characteristic of a firestorm firebombing is a technique designed to damage a target generally an urban area through the use of fire caused by incendiary devices rather than from the blast effect of large bombs such raids often employ both incendiary devices and high explosives the high explosive destroys roofs making it easier for the incendiary devices to penetrate the structures and cause fires the high explosives also disrupt the ability of firefighters to douse the fires 26 although incendiary bombs have been used to destroy buildings since the start of gunpowder warfare world war ii saw the first use of strategic bombing from the air to destroy the ability of the enemy to wage war london coventry and many other british cities were firebombed during the blitz most large german cities were extensively firebombed starting in 1942 and almost all large japanese cities were firebombed during the last six months of world war ii as sir arthur harris the officer commanding raf bomber command from 1942 through to the end of the war in europe pointed out in his post war analysis although many attempts were made to create deliberate man made firestorms during world war ii few attempts succeeded the germans again and again missed their chance of setting our cities ablaze by a concentrated attack coventry was adequately concentrated in point of space but all the same there was little concentration in point of time and nothing like the fire tornadoes of hamburg or dresden ever occurred in this country but they did do us enough damage to teach us the principle of concentration the principle of starting so many fires at the same time that no fire fighting services however efficiently and quickly they were reinforced by the fire brigades of other towns could get them under control arthur harris 26 according to physicist david hafemeister firestorms occurred after about 5 of all fire bombing raids during world war ii but he does not explain if this is a percentage based on both allied and axis raids or combined allied raids or u s raids alone 46 in 2005 the american national fire protection association stated in a report that three major firestorms resulted from allied conventional bombing campaigns during world war ii hamburg dresden and tokyo 34 they do not include the comparatively minor firestorms at kassel darmstadt or even ube into their major firestorm category despite later quoting and corroborating glasstone and dolan and data collected from these smaller firestorms based on world war ii experience with mass fires resulting from air raids on germany and japan the minimum requirements for a firestorm to develop are considered by some authorities to be the following 1 at least 8 pounds of combustibles per square foot of fire area 40 kg per square meter 2 at least half of the structures in the area on fire simultaneously 3 a wind of less than 8 miles per hour at the time and 4 a minimum burning area of about half a square mile glasstone and dolan 1977 10 21st century cities in comparison to world war ii cities edit a u s air force table showing the total number of bombs dropped by the allies on germany s seven largest cities during the entirety of world war ii 47 city population in 1939 american tonnage british tonnage total tonnage berlin 4 339 000 22 090 45 517 67 607 hamburg 1 129 000 17 104 22 583 39 687 munich 841 000 11 471 7 858 19 329 cologne 772 000 10 211 34 712 44 923 leipzig 707 000 5 410 6 206 11 616 essen 667 000 1 518 36 420 37 938 dresden 642 000 4 441 2 659 7 100 unlike the highly combustible world war ii cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons a fema report suggests that due to the nature of modern u s city design and construction a firestorm is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation 27 because highrise buildings do not lend themselves to the formation of firestorms because of the baffle effect of the structures 1 and firestorms are unlikely in areas whose modern buildings have totally collapsed with the exceptions of tokyo and hiroshima because of the nature of their densely packed flimsy wooden buildings in world war ii 45 48 there is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of world war ii cities that firestormed and that of modern cities where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for a firestorm to form 40 kg m2 49 50 therefore firestorms are not to be expected in modern north american cities after a nuclear detonation and are expected to be unlikely in modern european cities 51 similarly one reason for the lack of success in creating a true firestorm in the bombing of berlin in world war ii was that the building density or builtupness factor in berlin was too low to support easy fire spread from building to building another reason was that much of the building construction was newer and better than in most of the old german city centers modern building practices in the berlin of world war ii led to more effective firewalls and fire resistant construction mass firestorms never proved to be possible in berlin no matter how heavy the raid or what kinds of firebombs were dropped no true firestorm ever developed 52 nuclear weapons in comparison to conventional weapons edit the incendiary effects of a nuclear explosion do not present any especially characteristic features in principle the same overall result with respect to destruction of life and property can be achieved by the use of conventional incendiary and high explosive bombs 53 it has been estimated for example that the same fire ferocity and damage produced at hiroshima by one 16 kiloton nuclear bomb from a single b 29 could have instead been produced by about 1 200 tons 1 2 kilotons of incendiary bombs from 220 b 29s distributed over the city for nagasaki a single 21 kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on the city could have been estimated to be caused by 1 200 tons of incendiary bombs from 125 b 29s 53 54 55 it may seem counterintuitive that the same amount of fire damage caused by a nuclear weapon could have instead been produced by smaller total yield of thousands of incendiary bombs however world war ii experience supports this assertion for example although not a perfect clone of the city of hiroshima in 1945 in the conventional bombing of dresden the combined royal air force raf and united states army air forces usaaf dropped a total of 3441 3 tons approximately 3 4 kilotons of ordnance about half of which was incendiary bombs on the night of 13 14 february 1945 and this resulted in more than 2 5 square miles 6 5 km2 of the city being destroyed by fire and firestorm effects according to one authoritative source 56 or approximately 8 square miles 21 km2 by another 29 in total about 4 5 kilotons of conventional ordnance was dropped on the city over a number of months during 1945 and this resulted in approximately 15 square miles 39 km2 of the city being destroyed by blast and fire effects 57 during the operation meetinghouse firebombing of tokyo on 9 10 march 1945 279 of the 334 b 29s dropped 1 665 tons of incendiary and high explosive bombs on the city resulting in the destruction of over 10 000 acres of buildings 16 square miles 41 km2 a quarter of the city 58 59 in contrast to these raids when a single 16 kiloton nuclear bomb was dropped on hiroshima 4 5 square miles 12 km2 of the city was destroyed by blast fire and firestorm effects 45 similarly major cortez f enloe a surgeon in the usaaf who worked with the united states strategic bombing survey ussbs said that the 21 kiloton nuclear bomb dropped on nagasaki did not do as much fire damage as the extended conventional airstrikes on hamburg 60 hiroshima after the bombing and firestorm wind blowing the smoke plume inland during the 26 may 1945 firebombing raid on tokyo hiroshima aftermath despite a true firestorm developing reinforced concrete buildings as in tokyo similarly remained standing signed by the enola gay pilot paul w tibbets this tokyo residential section was virtually destroyed all that remained standing were concrete buildings in this photograph american historian gabriel kolko also echoed this sentiment during november 1944 american b 29 s began their first incendiary bomb raids on tokyo and on 9 march 1945 wave upon wave dropped masses of small incendiaries containing an early version of napalm on the city s population soon small fires spread connected grew into a vast firestorm that sucked the oxygen out of the lower atmosphere the bomb raid was a success for the americans they killed 125 000 japanese in one attack the allies bombed hamburg and dresden in the same manner and nagoya osaka kobe and tokyo again on may 24 in fact the atomic bomb used against hiroshima was less lethal than massive fire bombing only its technique was novel nothing more there was another difficulty posed by mass conventional bombing and that was its very success a success that made the two modes of human destruction qualitatively identical in fact and in the minds of the american military i was a little fearful secretary of war stimson told president truman that before we could get ready the air force might have japan so thoroughly bombed out that the new weapon would not have a fair background to show its strength to this the president laughed and said he understood 61 this break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors first the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires in an incendiary bombing raid incendiary weapons followed after high explosive blast weapons were dropped in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons the so called two ton cookies 33 also known as blockbusters were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains as well as to blow off roofs doors and windows creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped ideally into holes created by the prior blast weapons such into attic and roof spaces 62 63 64 on the other hand nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order with thermal effects and flash occurring first which are then followed by the slower blast wave it is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield it is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts franklin d olier samuel glasstone and philip j dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton 1 000 tons of incendiary bombs 53 54 the second factor explaining the non intuitive break in the expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used but on the conditions in and around the city itself with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors a few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm namely high fuel loading are already inherent to the city see bat bomb the great fire of london in 1666 although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition serves as an example that given a densely packed and predominately wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area a mass fire is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace on the other hand the largest nuclear weapon conceivable will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city s properties namely its fuel density are not conducive to one developing despite the disadvantage of nuclear weapons when compared to conventional weapons of lower or comparable yield in terms of effectiveness at starting fires for the reasons discussed above nuclear weapons also do not add any fuel to a city and fires are entirely dependent on what was contained in the city prior to bombing in direct contrast to the incendiary device effect of conventional raids one undeniable advantage of nuclear weapons over conventional weapons when it comes to creating fires is that nuclear weapons undoubtedly produce all their thermal and explosive effects in a very short period of time that is to use arthur harris s terminology they are the epitome of an air raid guaranteed to be concentrated in point in time in contrast early in world war ii the ability to achieve conventional air raids concentrated in point of time depended largely upon the skill of pilots to remain in formation and their ability to hit the target whilst at times also being under heavy fire from anti aircraft fire from the cities below nuclear weapons largely remove these uncertain variables therefore nuclear weapons reduce the question of whether a city will firestorm or not to a smaller number of variables to the point of becoming entirely reliant on the intrinsic properties of the city such as fuel loading and predictable atmospheric conditions such as wind speed in and around the city and less reliant on the unpredictable possibility of hundreds of bomber crews acting together successfully as a single unit see also edit blackout wartime

shows a human like personality by displays of empathy kindness and concern for individuals rather than thinking only of the green lantern corps in such dc crossover limited series such as kingdom come this particular guardian is presented as being part of the quintessence a group of gods who oversee their entire universe or multiverse yet shows signs of focusing especially on earth although he has been portrayed much as the other guardians he is often distinguished by tying his hair into a long ponytail in contrast to the shorter and unkempt hair of other male guardians citation needed green lantern secret origin edit main article green lantern secret origin in the green lantern secret origin story ganthet without ever revealing himself physically asks sinestro to investigate the death of abin sur through a non official channel bypassing protocol this leads to sinestro first meeting on earth with hal jordan 1 ganthet s tale edit the graphic novel ganthet s tale by john byrne expanded from a story by larry niven tells the story of hal jordan s first encounters with ganthet jordan is asked to help him battle the renegade guardian dawlakispokpok nicknamed dawly who is trying to use a time machine to change history in the early era of the planet oa a scientist named krona had attempted to use a device to see the beginning of time and in using his time machine bled the universe of a billion years of its potential duration dawly is going to use another time machine to thrust krona to the end of time to prevent his following through with that plan however in battling dawly he learns that dawly is responsible for the mishap of the universe being born old when dawly s family is brought before the guardians ganthet shields jordan s mind allowing him to retain his memory of one of the biggest secrets of the guardians emerald twilight edit main article emerald twilight after the destruction of coast city in the reign of the supermen storyline 2 the subsequent insanity of hal jordan and the destruction of the main power battery the guardians decide to focus all of their remaining power into ganthet recognising that he was the only one of them to foresee a catastrophe like hal jordan s current attack on them as such he becomes the last guardian ganthet creates a new green lantern ring from jordan s ring which was crushed by the former green lantern after murdering sinestro and goes to earth he appears before kyle rayner and hastily hands him the ring muttering you shall have to do 3 guy gardner later claimed that ganthet first went to him but he had turned down ganthet s plan during rayner s first few months as green lantern ganthet is unsatisfied with rayner and attempts to take back the ring 4 rayner eventually earns the respect of ganthet by facing parallax without his ring 5 the quintessence edit ganthet became part of the circle of gods including usually shazam zeus highfather and phantom stranger committed to observing the universe and counseling one another 6 ion and the new guardians edit when rayner briefly became the godlike ion he possessed more power than hal jordan did as parallax 7 realizing that he could not continue as ion without losing his humanity kyle traveled to the recently restored oa to recharge the central power battery by doing so he created a new set of guardians this time as small children both male and female with the intent that ganthet as their father figure will look after them and teach them how to be better guardians than their predecessors volume issue needed after one of the children lianna went missing and was later revealed to have aged prematurely ganthet invited the zamarons to oa to help raise them with him volume issue needed when the martian manhunter reverted to the burning martian identity that the guardians of the universe had locked away long ago and attacked the justice league ganthet teleported john stewart to safety and treated his injuries when the rest of the league teleported to the fortress of solitude to escape the burning s initial attack 8 ganthet was later able to tell john the history of the burning martians and teach him a way to reroute his mind to think in the first language of the universe so that he could rescue his teammates from fernus in a hit and run attack although the intensity of this method of thought meant that john could not use it for more than sixty seconds without burning his mind out allowing them to come up with a plan to defeat fernus 9 green lantern rebirth edit ganthet played a crucial role in resurrecting hal jordan who was revealed to be possessed by the fear entity parallax during green lantern rebirth following the return of hal jordan all the guardians are aged to adulthood and are just as cold and manipulative as before the only change is that there are now female guardians as well as male ganthet of course still retains a sense of individuality amongst the guardians believing that they should retain their emotions sayd is the only other guardian who shares his mindset volume issue needed sinestro corps war edit during the sinestro corps war he and sayd are banished from the council for embracing emotions discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other 10 just as parallax freed from any hosts attacks the lanterns for freeing kyle rayner ganthet and sayd arrive and draw parallax into four separate lanterns hal guy john and kyle s respectively reasoning that the earth lanterns had proven their superior ability to overcome fear and the division would prevent anyone from being able to release parallax again as ganthet explains he and sayd were kicked out of the guardians of the universe ganthet s final act as guardian is offering kyle his power ring he asks if kyle is willing to downgrade himself to a normal green lantern which kyle quickly accepts the four men then take their lanterns and hearing the sinestro corps oath recite the classic green lantern oath and depart to confront sinestro s corps 11 ganthet and sayd also explain to the four about the emotional spectrum created at the start of the universe that is separated into seven colors green willpower yellow fear violet love red rage indigo compassion orange greed and blue hope each representing different forms of emotion with green being the most center balanced of the energies the further at one end an energy color is the wilder its power is to control the energy ends up corrupting its user ganthet also reveals that in the coming future each color will have its own forces like the lantern corps and these forces will fight against the others in a battle across the universe that will lead into the event known as the blackest night the worst of the hidden prophecies of the book of oa 12 blackest night edit main article blackest night at the end of the sinestro corps war ganthet and sayd are currently living on the planet odym they harness the blue energy of hope and make plans to create another intergalactic police force in order to aid the guardians and the green lantern corps in their upcoming battle against the blackest night the first of the blue lanterns is an alien named saint bro dee walker or saint walker the second is warth an elephant like alien from sector two according to saint walker warth will select another candidate from a different sector of space and the process will continue from there 13 later ganthet reveals to the blue lantern corps that he and sayd are planning to create an alliance to those who wield the indigo power of compassion along with oa 14 however ganthet sayd and the blue lanterns find themselves being attacked by agent orange as the villain seeks the powers they possess larfleeze desires anything he does not have 15 they were eventually rescued by hal jordan accompanied by carol ferris sinestro and indigo tribe member indigo 1 16 ganthet and sayd then seek atrocitus and larfleeze s aid to recreate the white light of creation with their saviors in order to get larfleeze to cooperate with them sayd offers her servitude to agent orange who expresses a desire of having his own guardian over ganthet s protests ganthet and sayd later arrive at coast city with the lanterns to aid earth s heroes they also try to free the guardians from the black central battery 17 18 failing that ganthet duplicates hal jordan s ring and places it on his own finger inducting himself into the green lantern corps he and sayd also duplicate the other lantern rings allowing the other six corps to gain temporary deputies to fight alongside the seven already present until the rest of the corps can arrive as a result barry allen becomes a blue lantern lex luthor becomes an orange lantern scarecrow becomes a sinestro corps officer nscientist ray palmer becomes an indigo tribesman mera becomes a red lantern and wonder woman after being freed from the influence of her black lantern ring becomes a star sapphire 19 brightest day edit main article brightest day after the blackest night is over ganthet is seen plotting with guy gardner and atrocitus a new universe saving plan against a new hidden foe to further advance his new cause ganthet renounces his guardian status requesting his fellow oans to fill in the permanent post of green lantern of sector 0 forging his own lantern and power ring in the process notably his new power battery lacks the ordinary rounder design and looks much similar to the squared older ones once wielded by the manhunters and the halla s 17 he was later forced to assist hank henshaw who has learned from the hidden foe that ganthet is apparently the key to henshaw s permanent death 20 by threatening to make the alpha lanterns kill themselves if ganthet does not cooperate henshaw made ganthet operate several alpha lanterns to try and restore them to organic life forms believing that the process once perfected can be used to return him to a mortal body 21 during the process some alpha lanterns perished ganthet experiences great grief at the death of these green lanterns emotions he is not quite familiar with ganthet was rescued by a squad of lanterns and hank henshaw s form and spirit were destroyed afterward all the alpha lanterns have their free will restored as well thanks to ganthet sadly they must keep their cyborg appearances 22 ganthet brings up more blood which transforms into atrocitus head who reveals their alliance ganthet is forced to admit to his fellow lanterns that a short time ago that formed into a tapestry of future events and that having learned that atrocitus had the same thing happen to him he and guy entered into their alliance 23 war of the green lanterns edit main article war of the green lanterns with krona having returned parallax to the green lantern power battery and infecting the other six remaining guardians with the other emotional entities ganthet kilowog and the four earth based green lanterns are the only ones even partly immune to parallax s influence due to their prior experience under his influence but he is still forced to take john and kyle s rings when they are driven to attack each other unfortunately when ganthet takes their rings and his own the three rings explode destroying his hand forcing john to bandage the amputated limb with the other green lanterns searching for them ganthet orders john and kyle to depart while he uses his own guardian based powers to draw the lanterns away 24 despite the odds against them the four earth lanterns were able to rescue ganthet from krona using the rings of the other six corps hal wielding sinestro s ring guy wielding atrocitus s ring john indigo 1 s ring and kyle wielding saint walker s ring ganthet later advising hal and guy to use larfleeze and carol s rings respectively to remove parallax from the central power battery to free the other green lanterns from his influence 25 ganthet was also able to help guy master both of his rings by encouraging him to tap into something that he loved and something that he hated 26 afterward ganthet is visited by saint walker who restores his hand his blue ring shows ganthet an image of sayd revealing that he still misses her 27 the new 52 edit following the war of the green lanterns storyline to compensate for the new shortage of guardians the other guardians strip ganthet of his emotions so that he will rejoin their ranks 28 kyle rayner comes to oa for help after something has turned him into a ring magnet causing rings from the other six corps to try and latch on to him kyle likens ganthet s transformation to a lobotomy though ganthet himself disputes this because my cognitive abilities are unimpaired kyle then compares the process to taking away ganthet s soul as he is now nothing more than another guardian a charge to which ganthet does not respond 29 after kyle is briefly overwhelmed by the other rings he wields kyle s green ring throws ganthet aside when he attempts to remove it as the other lanterns attempt to help kyle saint walker appeals to ganthet for help but ganthet simply throws walker off now regarding the blue lantern corps as a mistake that must be rectified 30 ganthet s dismissive attitude towards his past remains even when sayd is revealed to be accompanying larfleeze s attack although he appears to retain a degree of affection for kyle as he offers kyle a chance to return to the green lantern corps if he agrees to remain on oa so that the consequences of his temporary period wielding the other six rings can be studied however hearing sayd tell him that the ganthet they knew will be gone forever if kyle goes with him now kyle rejects ganthet and escapes with the other ring wielders stating that while he may consider ganthet a father he has to do things his way 31 it is later revealed that ganthet told the other guardians that during his time as a green lantern he found the corps like the manhunters has serious flaws because of the disobedience of green lanterns like hal jordan or sinestro and announces that it is time to replace the green lantern corps with the third army 32 although the new guardians go their separate ways when it is revealed that sayd brought them together by drawing rings from weaker wielders to kyle rayner due to his connection to ganthet 33 kyle is apparently still trying to recruit other ring wielders together in an attempt to rescue ganthet and restore him to what he was even as ganthet himself states that he considers the guardians as having saved him rather than the other way around 34 ganthet arrives on zamaron to attack kyle he nearly kills him with his blasts while the third army invades the zamaron homeworld but the injured kyle transforms into the white lantern having mastered the seven powers of the emotional spectrum due to his refusal to give up on ganthet helping him master the violet power of love when ganthet witnesses kyle being able to destroy the third army he becomes horrified and flees while the group will apparently be able to stop the guardians threat 35 when the first lantern volthoom is freed as ganthet and the guardians of the universe tried to use the third army to destroy the sentient beings 36 he imprisons the guardians on the planet maltus and restores their emotions to their original state ganthet comes to feel shame for his actions and for his battle with kyle 37 in the final battle after volthoom is destroyed by hal jordan and nekron the guardians are freed but are executed by a parallax empowered sinestro he spares only ganthet and reunites him with the still living sayd citing his reasons as being that he knows what it is like to lose everything but exiles them both from oa 38 ganthet and sayd later observe kyle ganthet reflects that he and kyle have grown a great deal during their time together but it is time for kyle to leave the nest and make his own way 39 dc rebirth edit following the green lantern corps disappearance with nobody protecting the universe ganthet and sayd are happy on an unknown planet elsewhere but the former sensed the spectrum of green light 40 their exile has ended when a green power ring arrive on the planet nok asking them to find hal jordan 41 ganthet and sayd realized hal s life is in peril so they summoned kyle rayner to save his life 42 they used their power and kyle s white ring to open a doorway to emerald space in the afterlife and manages to bring hal back to the realm of the living 43 ganthet encouraged hal about harnessing the green light of pure willpower and the need of forging a new green ring he told hal that the green lantern corps has returned while they arrived at the base of mogo and reunited it 44 while the green lantern corps are reinstated ganthet and sayd assign hal and kyle to find saint walker 45 after they brought saint walker back to the base of the green lantern corps 46 they called kyle to test his white lantern power which they believed could bring the resurrection of the blue lantern corps when saint walker attempted a psionic link to kyle s power he was prevented from doing so by an unknown presence which caused kyle s white lantern power to shut down leading to his return as a green lantern 47 later ganthet and sayd were attacked and kidnapped by the controllers 48 they wanted to harvest sayd s power to empower the controllers which horrified ganthet four green lanterns of the earth however were able to locate the controllers base at sector 3001 and attacked 49 after the controllers were defeated ganthet announced that sayd will return as the guardians of the universe including the templar guardians as new members for that will be their legacy 50 other versions edit in the star trek green lantern crossover series ganthet is shown being menaced by an unseen figure that proclaimed it has killed all of the other guardians and destroyed the six other corps this meant that ganthet was in possession of the last rings of each of the six non green lantern corps rings as the unknown entity attacked him using the last of his power ganthet transports himself and the rings to the star trek universe where his corpse is later discovered by the uss enterprise and taken aboard for examination 51 after hal jordan makes contact with the enterprise it was revealed that the enemy attacking ganthet was nekron who had destroyed virtually all other life in their universe ganthet sacrificed himself to initiate the last light protocol and send the last rings and ring wielders to another universe

used as comic relief contents 1 publication history 2 fictional character biography 2 1 working with the league 2 2 qward battle 2 3 post league 2 4 larfleeze 3 other versions 3 1 i can t believe it s

justice league international 10 and was created by keith giffen and j m dematteis during their justice league period 3 his name was originally spelled gnort his semi human face manner of speech and style of dress showed that the inspiration for the character was sewer worker ed norton played by art carney in the classic television series the honeymooners however in later appearances his face became more canine and the spelling of his name was changed 4 fictional character biography edit g nort is from the planet g newt hal jordan explains that g nort became a green lantern due to the influence of his uncle who was a famous member of the lantern corps 2 despite his obviously limited intelligence not intelligent enough to read a map and profoundly lacking tactical judgment the character is consistently depicted as brave loyal and honorable this fact is overlooked by most heroes although superman has pointed it out on occasion early in his career g nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the league s battle against the manhunters recognizing g nort s general incompetence the corps had given him an uninhabited sector of space to patrol the fact that the region was uninhabited also suited the needs of the manhunters who set up their home planet in g nort s sector g nort joined hal jordan superman and other justice league members in an assault on the home world although g nort s main contribution was getting stuck in the planet s ventilation system 5 working with the league edit g nort s arch enemy the scarlet skier a take off of marvel s silver surfer is described as being the only felon g nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career also an idiot the skier was mistaken for a pan handling homeless person when traveling in the subway g nort goes on a mission to rescue mister miracle from the interstellar trader manga khan traveling in a spaceship g nort works with big barda martian manhunter and dmitri of the rocket reds they chase down khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer lobo 6 both g nort and the skier were founding members of justice league antarctica created by maxwell lord for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed injustice league out of his way the league including g nort find their antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins their enemies are ultimately destroyed but not before the facility itself gets demolished g nort keeps himself and his new found allies alive via his power ring until help arrives 7 g nort assists the league this time consisting of manhunter crimson fox and ice when mr nebula the skier s old boss turns his dangerous cosmic powered attention to earth mr nebula saw the garishness of las vegas and thought earth had the same taste as he and thus left 8 g nort sees himself as a green lantern at large not bound to a single space sector his most successful mission apart from capturing the skier has been when a gang of interstellar bank robbing humanoid cats surrender as soon as he appears qward battle edit eventually it is discovered that both g nort and his uncle g newman were actually given their rings by the poglachians who posed as the guardians of the universe while the real guardians were with the zamarons a race of clowns the poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways they were actually pawns of the weaponers of qward who hoped to discredit the green lantern corps by having the name associated with idiots g nort works with guy gardner ending up in qward itself 9 though g nort loses his qwardian powered ring their confrontations against a qwardian sinestro cult goes badly faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed g nort gives up the location of hal jordan soon after powerless but free from a qwardian cell g nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down the soldier swiftly overpowers g nort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would torture and kill guy enraged g nort defeats the soldier gains his ring and saves guy by destroying the source of his very own power the two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area afterwards guy gardner reluctantly tells the real guardians that g nort was the true hero on qward which earned g nort status as a genuine green lantern 10 around this time g nort is kicked out of the league and meets up with a struggling street musician whom he takes to calling sax girl 11 he saves her from a life of homelessness and they have multiple adventures together they part on friendly terms with a kiss 12 he has other adventures on his own such as battling several supervillains who pretend to terrorize a small town for a cut of tourism dollars 12 post league edit g nort presumably lost his ring during emerald twilight and subsequently like many former lanterns joined the darkstars he still wears his darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses when he is captured by manga khan who

ransom l ron returns with khan he is persuaded to form a super buddies of antarctica branch and is seen trying to hitch a ride 13 g nort was seen as the sole member of super buddies antarctica exactly where maxwell lord wants him for a time g nort lives behind guy gardner s new york warriors bar 14 he appeared later in the mini series guy gardner collateral damage where his homeworld had been destroyed by the rann thanagar war the character was portrayed more serious in this story suffering heavily from the loss of his family 15 as of green lantern sinestro corps secret files origins 1 g

side although his programming and own sentience have displayed no ambition towards world conquest his very existence is a hazard to all of humanity 3 fictional character biography edit the android amazo was created by professor anthony ivo a scientist with expertise in multiple fields who is obsessed with immortality 4 the original justice league of america green lantern flash aquaman wonder woman and the martian manhunter discover their powers are being drained and somehow then being used by a thief who is after animals known to have long lifespans while attempting to discover the perpetrator the league is confronted and defeated by amazo who has duplicated their powers thanks to absorption cell technology created by ivo 5 amazo brings the team to ivo who reveals he has created a means of extending his life span courtesy of the data obtained from studying the creatures amazo captured the league then defeats ivo and the android ivo s immortality results in his body becoming monstrous in form and the android is stored in the league trophy room 6 the android is temporarily re activated twice to assist the league in regaining lost abilities 7 8 in these and subsequent stories the android s duplication of powers don t make others feel their powers being drained when red sun radiation reaches earth amazo reactivates and engages in an extensive battle with superman involving time travel only to be defeated before it can murder ivo and the league 9 later the super villain called the key having been shrunken in size re activates the android in a failed bid to restore his original height the league defeats amazo and then new team member zatanna restores the key to his former state 10 after the justice league of america disbands and reforms as a small team of mostly new heroes based in detroit ivo reactivates amazo to attack this less experienced weaker league the android defeats all the new members but is finally stopped by justice league founding members the martian manhunter and aquaman 11 a different amazo model is later activated and battles the superhero team the conglomerate 12 this updated amazo searches for ivo and encounters the hero aztek who succeeds in reasoning with the android rather than overpowering it 13 this amazo model also briefly battles the resurrection man before finally being destroyed 14 before his destruction the second model of amazo is summoned into the future by the android hero hourman who wishes to meet his ancestor this amazo copies hourman s time warping worlogog artifact becoming timazo in the process timazo wreaks havoc with his new ability to manipulate time but is defeated by hourman and returned to his place in the past so his history can run its course 15 another similar model of amazo later has several more encounters with hourman 16 another model of amazo is activated that can wield multiple powers at once and is programmed to automatically upgrade its abilities to match those of all active justice league members initially not understanding this upgrade the justice league calls in reserve members to help defeat amazo which only results in its power increasing on the atom s advice superman active team chairman at the time announces the league is officially disbanded programmed only to mimic the powers of active members this amazo is suddenly depowered and easily deactivated 17 years later batman and nightwing discover a partially built amazo android in a weapons shipment and destroy it 18 another amazo participates in a massive attack by a group of villains on the city of metropolis but is destroyed by black adam 19 it is eventually revealed that after perfecting amazo s absorption cells ivo combined this technology with human ova and dna to create a son of amazo who grows up as frank halloran unaware of his heritage years later frank is a philosophy student dating a young woman named sara when his powers are awakened prematurely rather than emulate his villainous father frank hopes to be a hero called kid amazo slowly becoming mentally unstable kid amazo discovers sara is ivo s daughter and was instructed to monitor frank by posing as a girlfriend kid amazo goes on a rampage batman deduces kid amazo has not only the powers of the leaguers but also their contrasting personality traits this is later used to cause greater internal instability destroying kid amazo 20 later ivo downloads amazo s programming into the body of the red tornado the android villain turned hero created by professor t o morrow another enemy of the justice league the league battles an army of red tornado androids before discovering that the villain solomon grundy intends to transfer his mind into the original android tornado s body although this plan is defeated the amazo programming asserts itself and attacks the league until member vixen destroys it 21 a new body is created to house red tornado s consciousness but the amazo programming inhabits it instead battling justice league before he s defeated by being teleported into the gravity well of the red star antares 22 the new 52 edit as part of the new 52 the new origin story of the justice league references the a maze operating system and b maze operating system designed by anthony ivo 23 the league later battles an android equipped with a corrupt version of this operating system 24 during the forever evil storyline the new 52 amazo appears as a member of the secret society of super villains 25 during the amazo virus storyline a biotech pathogen is created based on the android s absorption cells the first person to be infected by this virus is former lexcorp research scientist armen ikarus whose mind becomes corrupted in the process and replaced by the virus s will now possessing power and driven to infect others ikarus s personality is replaced by the new amazo the ikarus amazo infects others granting them super powers based on desires and personality traits but killing them within 24 hours the ikarus amazo able to enhance infected humans and control them through a hive mind connection is defeated by the justice league young reggie meyer and his family are also affected influenced by technology from the original amazo android reggie becomes kid amazo 26 dc rebirth edit in the storyline outbreak amazo is one of the villains recruited by an a i named genie created by the daughter of computer technician james palmer 27 his technology cells are later hacked and he briefly joins the justice league s side 28 amazo later appeared as a member of the cabal alongside per degaton doctor psycho queen bee and hugo strange 29 30 powers and abilities edit amazo android edit amazo is an advanced android built using professor anthony ivo s absorption cell technology this technology later indicated to involve nanites allows amazo s cells to mimic the physical structure and energy output of organic beings he encounters empowering him to mimic physical and energy based abilities such as the strength of superman the speed of the flash or the fighting skill of batman amazo s internal energy source provides power for these abilities so it does not matter what source of power is used by the superhuman he is mimicking such as wonder woman s speed being based on magical empowerment and superman s speed being a result of kryptonian cells fueled by solar radiation after his first story many amazo models retain the powers of the first five founding leaguers he met as a default power set absorbing new abilities based on other leaguers they encounter the models are usually only able to access a single target s unique attributes at a time some models have internally possessed the powers of many justice league members not just founding members in their internal database and can summon them at will but again only utilizing one person s powers at a time 31 some later amazo versions are upgraded to use and mimic multiple powers at once from any superhuman they come in contact with or anyone it identifies as a justice league member 32 several amazo models can create duplicates of weapons as well such as the power ring of green lantern the metal mace of hawkgirl or the lasso of wonder woman these copied weapons are more limited in power than the original products 33 at times amazo is a simple minded android capable of basic strategies and possessing average intelligence but with narrow focus some models of amazo have demonstrated advanced analysis and tactics in battle helping them maneuver to apply their stolen powers effectively to defeat opponents 34 in most incarnations amazo takes on a person s weaknesses simultaneously when mimicking their powers as an example becoming vulnerable to kryptonite radiation while using superman abilities multiple stories have also indicated that his android body designed to emulate the form and function of a human being also possesses the pressure points and stress spots the average human body possesses amazo ikarus edit arman ikarus is a former scientist and researcher at lexcorp who is the first to be exposed to the amazo virus outbreak 35 this version of amazo is driven to infect others with the amazo virus causing them to develop psychoactive superhuman abilities based on inherent desires and characteristics before dying within 24 hours the ikarus amazo could emulate technology and super powers he encountered by crudely modifying his genetic structure and biological structure 36 the ikarus amazo can remotely augment the physical abilities of anyone infected with the amazo virus and influence their behavior through establishing a mental hive mind connection 37 initially ikarus s body seemed to degenerate from the strain of the virus altering his biology but later his form stabilized and evolved into the appearance of the classic amazo android other versions edit captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew edit captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew 14 15 featured the parallel earth of

one time love the mercenary flicker and an entire teban convoy 4 some time later new recruits of the green lantern corps were shown the book of oa a book kept by the guardians of the universe which told tales of green lanterns past present and future they learned stories which would help them be better green lanterns 5 the new members had this training disrupted when they went to earth to help free hal jordan from the influence of the villain eclipso they were no match for the eclipsed jordan and star sapphire eclipso managed to escape the corps and soon they returned to oa guy gardner was awarded a ring by the guardians of the universe to act as temporary green lantern of space sector 2814 6 she would quickly prove to be a skilled power ring wielder a worthwhile addition to the green lantern corps nevertheless her problem with authority and authority figures posed a continuing problem she was often at odds with kreon of tebis another new recruit to the corps as the former chieftain of the teban battle fleet he was used to discipline and military precision their infighting had even jeopardized oa and the guardians during a qwardian invasion guy gardner had returned to oa to take the yellow power ring of sinestro without kilowog to guide them the green lanterns were in chaos kreon and boodikka came to blows when the rival green lantern criticized her for being an undisciplined fighter running out of options kilowog brought the two squabbling green lanterns to john stewart as a guest lecturer in cooperation and tolerance stewart performed a mind scan on the two recruits and somehow exchanged their consciousnesses the two green lanterns were faced with their ultimate fears kreon s was represented by mama denata and his fear of the uncontrollable while boodikka s fear was the chain men which represented the suffocation she felt by authoritative restraints the two had no choice but to learn to work together or be defeated 7 boodikka never lost her love of battle she eagerly fought against the incarnation of entropy even though the encounter then seemed to mean certain death boodikka proved to have come a long way as a green lantern then working as a team with the other members of the corps to defeat entropy 8 in a space sector far removed from our own galaxy boodikka was assigned to investigate the deaths of multiple alien races that had suddenly destroyed themselves in an apparent mass suicide environmental destruction or otherwise massive wars upon arriving on a world in the midst of tearing itself apart boodikka encountered guy gardner he and his colleagues the gardners of the universe had been dispatched to solve the same problem as boodikka guy sought to prove to his leadership abilities to his team of super powered aliens from across known space it was not long until gardner got into an altercation with the green lantern it was during this fight that guy realized his yellow ring was powered by the energy of the green lanterns power rings 9 fully charged gardner s yellow power ring enabled him to recognize the true threat created in the anti matter universe of qward his power ring negated the mental block of the real attackers gardner used his ring to free the others from their trance boodikka s respite would not last long an alien race called the ophidians had come to cleanse known space on two occasions in their sordid past they had been nearly annihilated by alien invaders then since confining themselves to eradicating all other life in the universe to insure their pseudo religious quest would never again be in harm s way the ophidians would entrance their victims before causing them to fight amongst themselves all the way to extinction as the ophidian ship managed to elude them boodikka and gardner had to join their minds together to achieve the speed needed to overtake them when they reached the ship it exploded whether this was a result of feedback from the two fighting off the mind control or self destruction is unknown the pair now had no way to find the ophidian s homeworld after the battle boodikka called upon the guardians of the universe to consult in the matter of recovering gardner s qwardian power ring the guardians however had determined gardner was working toward the same ends they were although they would be watching gardner they decided not to act on gardner for the time being 9 10 a fierce warrior boodikka was well versed in many combative arts including the use of short swords handguns and explosives often she would visit her own mother for combat on bellatrix this was considered a good time boodikka s own grandmother had been killed by her own daughter arisia a former green lantern of graxos iv and onetime love of hal jordan told this story to justice leaguers power girl doctor light and maya when they inquired about women in the green lantern corps 11 at one point the green lantern corps were called upon to help hal jordan on the planet maltus he had been fighting the maltusian gods known as the triarch and was also under attack by the darkstars and the l e g i o n boodikka was as smitten by the fighting prowess of lobo bounty hunter and l e g i o n operative the two stopped in mid fight and went somewhere at lobo s suggestion for a formidable love making session that caused the two of them to miss the entire fight 12 13 14 15 boodikka eventually became a kind of recruiter for the corps in her search she encountered barin a young soldier of a kindred warrior species who she believed would prove to be an asset to her brethren as events would turn out barin was not quite at a point where he was ready to fight solo upon his first outing alone he was quickly besieged by a kind of space mongrels and went into shock the would be lantern was brought to oa where he was connected to life support systems since the destruction of oa by both the parallax ridden hal jordan and its resurrection by kyle rayner barin s ultimate fate remains unknown 16 17 emerald twilight and beyond edit her next mission was to stop hal jordan from reaching oa during emerald twilight by the direct order of the guardians of the universe although she fought well she was no match for jordan s willpower because she was unwilling to give up her ring freely jordan severed boodikka s hand to take her ring from it jordan left her floating in space and continued on towards oa where he would soon become parallax 18 jordan later mentioned that he had left boodikka along with the other green lanterns he had confronted on the way to oa with enough power to survive even after taking their rings 19 boodikka had survived joining the brotherhood of the cold flame on the planet xudar with other former green lanterns to find the means to atone for the crimes of hal jordan the brotherhood of the cold flame using the spirit of the deceased kilowog created the dark lantern an instrument of their vengeance against boodikka s wishes 20 boodikka was later discovered by hal jordan and guy gardner on the manhunter homeworld of biot in a state of suspended animation with other lost lanterns jordan had left for dead during emerald twilight at some point in time the manhunters in concert with hank henshaw had gathered up these former green lanterns put them into suspended animation and used their energies as a battery to create more advanced manhunters upon being freed from her slumber boodikka seemed shocked that she no longer had her hand and following commentary implied her last conscious memory was of fighting the parallax possessed hal jordan despite having lived some time after her maiming on xudar as part of the brotherhood of the cold flame 21 22 23 how or why boodikka was captured while on xudar assuming she still remained there remains unknown during the confrontation with the manhunters kreon dies and his ring chooses boodikka 24 she resumes her duties in the green lantern corps replacing her lost hand with an emerald one fueled by her power ring energies boodikka and her fellow lost lanterns keep their distance from hal jordan until parallax in the form of kyle rayner brings him to qward they followed knowing that the corps doesn t abandon its own 25 when parallax killed chance she attempted to vaporise him which her ring recognised as an illegal action consequently shutting down leaving her helpless boodikka then went with ke haan and laira to find ion deep beneath qward 26 instead they run into the anti monitor ke haan was killed but the others managed to rescue ion and return to oa at the same time the guardians had rewritten the book of oa allowing lanterns to use lethal force returning control of the ring to boodikka 27 post sinestro corps war edit boodikka as an alpha lantern boodikka became a member of the alpha lanterns an internal policing force within the corps itself soon after the sinestro war and the enactment of the second law of the book of oa the alpha lanterns make sure that no corps member performs an illegal action using a power ring each alpha lantern receives a second power ring and receives direct connections to the book of oa s laws and the central power battery the process involves surgical alteration into a hybrid of the individual recruit s biological form and updated manhunter technology in other words alpha lanterns are cyborgs 28 29 30 boodikka and the alpha lanterns are seen in final crisis fellow alpha lantern kraken is revealed to be taken over by granny goodness during hal jordan s trial after the alphas had arrested hal for the murder of orion 31 brightest day edit alpha lantern boodikka is shown to have been controlled by cyborg superman 32 as she attacks kyle rayner soranik natu and john stewart green lantern member hannu ambushes her and manages to damage her severely this temporarily frees her from cyborg superman s control and she instructs the other lanterns to recharge the battery with the energy she has absorbed 33 her fellow lanterns are able to repair her enough for her to fight and she joins in the attack on the cyborg superman s base during the battle the cyborg s body is destroyed and his consciousness attempts to take control of boodikka s body boodikka s consciousness fights back defeating him on her return to oa boodikka is made a member of the lantern honor guard her emotions restored due to the way she was freed from the cyborg s control however ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her boodikka asserts this is because ganthet s newly discovered emotions allowed her to be who she is boodikka s true self now in control of her body again not what she is an alpha lantern 34 reign of doomsday edit boodikka later appears at the remains of the destroyed planet new krypton where she encounters batman and supergirl of the justice league boodikka explains that the guardians had sent her on a mission to survey the ruins as a follow up to the initial green lantern corps inspection of the planet that took place during the world of new krypton storyline suddenly the heroes are attacked by doomsday who strikes boodikka across the back before she has a chance to react due to her injuries boodikka is unable to effectively wield her ring and is nearly captured by the creature before being rescued by supergirl with starman and saint walker of the blue lantern corps serving as a distraction batman and supergirl are able to get the injured boodikka to the jla watchtower doomsday follows them aboard and just as he is about to attack them cyborg superman emerges from boodikka s body and states that doomsday attacked boodikka and the jla members in order to get to him 35 after doomsday captures supergirl and cyborg superman and then flees the watchtower starman mentions that boodikka is healing herself in the jla medical facility and that she should soon have enough energy to return to oa 36 following the war of the green lanterns storyline boodikka and the alpha lanterns are killed by alpha lantern varix that believe that the alpha lanterns are being corrupted into judgement against john stewart during his trial varix then killed himself afterwards the bodies of alpha lanterns were interred on oa 37 in other media edit television edit boodikka appears briefly in the duck dodgers episode the green loontern as one of the lanterns defending oa from sinestro voiced by grey delisle she is later rescued by dodgers and the rest of the corps boodikka makes a cameo in justice league action episode watchtower tours film edit boodikka as she appears in green lantern first flight boodikka appears in green lantern first flight voiced by tricia helfer this version of boodikka is radically different from her comic version in

appearance in green lantern emerald knights reprised by grey delisle who was uncredited for the role boodikka also appears in the live action green lantern film in a cameo in a few scenes in the film

lord iii a successful businessman and head of the chimtech consortium maxwell iii set out to be a good example for his son by striving to always do what was right 3 when maxwell iv was 16 he came home to find his father dead in an apparent suicide his father had discovered that his company had produced a highly carcinogenic product and could not bear the guilt lord s mother was convinced by her husband to employ a similar practice cajoling heroic metahumans to help lord thus he sparked the plans to bring the justice league leaderless and broken after the crisis on infinite earths event under his exclusive control 4 giffen and dematteis years edit lord initially works behind the scenes to establish the justice league while under the control of a computer created by the villainous metron the computer wanted lord to set up a worldwide peacekeeping organization as part of its plan to dominate the world 5 lord talks with the martian manhunter on the need for a strong league a later retcon changed his controller to the villainous computer program kilg re pronounced kilgore 6 which had taken over metron s machine a much later retcon mitigated the kilg re s and metron s influence stating that lord already had plans for taking over the league and that he would have pursued them regardless 4 lord s ruthlessness at this time is illustrated when he sets up a disturbed would be terrorist as a villain for the league to defeat resulting in the man s death later lord rebels against the computer s influence and destroys it once free of the computer s influence lord is portrayed as an amoral businessman but not a real villain during the time that giffen and dematteis were writing the justice league lord is shown struggling with his conscience and developing heroic qualities though he would remain a con artist clarification needed citation needed from invasion to identity crisis edit originally a normal human lord is one of many people on earth gifted with superpowers during the invasion crossover when a gene bomb is exploded by alien invaders this bomb activates lord s latent metagene granting him the ability to control the minds of others albeit at great difficulty 7 despite being a metahuman lord never identifies as one instead at the urging of his mother to act for the benefit of non metahumans he shifts his hatred for the generic authority figures

power is burnt out lord reflects on his time with the league later lord is diagnosed with a brain tumor and dies kilg re however had been waiting for the right moment to reactivate its control of lord kilg re downloads lord s consciousness into a duplicate of one of dreamslayer s allies extremist cyborg lord havok in a further retcon the body is said to be a new genesis built automaton in this form

lands on earth easily trounces the league and kills superman with earth undefended world conqueror mongul invades and destroys coast city killing lord s mother this event further fuels his hatred and paranoia against the metahumans as well as leading him to believe that not only can metahumans not be trusted but that their personal battles and scuffles are enough to shatter world safety 4 lord

at the end of the prologue special issue he shoots and kills one time jli member ted kord the second blue beetle when the hero discovers lord s secret and refuses to join lord during this time alexander luthor jr the god like son of lex luthor from an alternate earth gives lord control over batman s brother eye a satellite system batman created to monitor all superhuman contact lord uses brother eye to create an army of omacs humans infected with a nano virus that transformed them into cyborgs programmed to hunt down and kill all superhumans volume issue needed lord is seemingly killed in cold blood by wonder woman art by phil jimenez lord also uses his powers to influence superman s mind causing him to brutally beat batman in the belief that he is brainiac lord subsequently sends superman to attack wonder woman after making him believe that she is his old enemy doomsday who has just killed his wife lois lane lord justifies the resulting destruction as proof of his argument about the dangers of superhumans pointing out the devastation that wonder woman and superman could cause if they fought in a crowded area and arguing that the fact that superman can be brought under another s control is evidence that superhumans cannot be relied upon in the midst of her battle with superman diana realizes that even if she defeats him he would still remain under lord s absolute mental control she creates a diversion lasting long enough for her to race back to lord s location and asks that he release superman lord bound by her lasso of truth complies but states that he ll use superman again to kill people when she demands to know how to free superman from lord s control lord replies kill me wonder woman then snaps his neck the omac project 2005 in response brother eye broadcasts the footage of wonder woman killing lord all over the world destroying her reputation and her friendship with batman and superman who reject her despite the fact that she saved their lives 11 as the crisis unfolds the three eventually reconcile as diana helps superman talk down his other self and prevents batman from shooting alexander luthor jr accepting that diana did what she had to do and acknowledging that for all their differences they all still want justice at the crisis counseling panel at wizard world chicago dan didio explained dc s reasoning in using lord s character in infinite crisis after going through several possible characters who could be the new leader for the offshoot of checkmate maxwell lord was suggested many of the editors thought that the idea made sense as lord had been shown to have a mean streak and to have killed previously the idea was dropped due to the continuity errors such as him being a cyborg but they went back to it later after deciding none of the other possible characters were suitable didio explained we thought about that aspect of the story where maxwell was turned into a cyborg some more and then asked did anyone read it no did anyone like the idea no so we moved ahead with max as being a human and having been a human and not letting that small part of the past stand in the way of this story we wanted what was best for countdown to infinite crisis and for us that meant that max had to be a human 12 one year later edit main article one year later lord reappeared in 2007 in the first two story arcs of the new booster gold series by geoff johns and dan jurgens at the end of the 52 pick up story arc booster gold and blue beetles from the past present and future go back in time to countdown to infinite crisis and prevent lord from killing ted kord in the subsequent blue and gold story arc blue beetle and booster gold discover that in saving ted kord they have created a new timeline where lord was never killed by wonder woman and lord s omacs and that a mind controlled superman has turned the entire planet into a police state lord reveals that he had been returned to human form after dozens of clandestine operations and that he learned the importance of control during that time when booster gold and blue beetle having assembled their old jli teammates storm brother eye lord is killed by dr light when she blasts a hole through his chest ted kord realizes that his death is the only way to fix the timestream and leaves the battle seemingly to return to the past and accept his death lord

s white power ring gives him a vision where lord is shown shaking hands with jaime reyes the third blue beetle however in this vision lord is hiding a gun behind his back implying that lord is planning to kill reyes just as lord killed reyes predecessor ted kord 19 in the first issue of justice league generation lost lord is the subject of an unprecedented international manhunt he is found hiding in the old justice league international embassy by booster gold whom lord is able to defeat lord then uses a device to amplify his mind control powers to unprecedented levels with these he

magog s spear he is propelled forward through time to 112 years in the future where lord while long dead has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war ruled by omacs captain atom is eventually

take down amanda waller 44 he chose these five as they were the original incarnation of the suicide squad and hence have experience working as a team prompting waller to capture the justice league to ask for their help against lord 45 while most of the heroes and villains do not recognize lord the displaced pre flashpoint superman shows awareness of him reflecting on his past contact with lord before reality was reset although the combined forces of the league and the squad are able to defeat lord s allies they are unable to prevent lord from achieving his goal with the aid of a controlled killer frost lord acquires the heart of darkness from a vault using it to enhance his powers to infect take control of the league 46 lord uses the infected justice league apart from batman who lord did not infect to achieve peace across america and has waller kidnapped and taken before him however despite believing that he had taken precautions to control the heart lord is forced by waller to recognize that it is manipulating his perceptions using lord s powers to spread chaos and evil across the world and twisting lord s perception of what is transpiring when waller is able to bring him to his senses lord tries to remove the heart of darkness but it consumes him and transforms him into eclipso 47 eclipso is driven out of lord when killer frost is able to use her powers to create a prism of ice channeling superman s heat vision at just the right frequency to disrupt lord s hold on his slaves with lord subsequently being immobilized by killer frost lord awakens in a cell specially designed to hold him with injectors pumping so much blood thinner into him that he would bleed to death if he attempted to access his powers he mockingly asks waller if she set this whole thing up just to justify the squad to the league but waller declines to reply and simply informs him that he is to prepare himself for service on task force xi 48 lord later works under the supervision of wonder woman in order to stop his dangerous technology from threatening innocent people 49 powers and abilities edit in his original depictions maxwell lord had no abilities but later became a metahuman as a result of the dominators invasion of earth lord s powers allow him to telepathically influence people s minds typically in the form of pushing a subconscious suggestion to others using his power causes max s nose to bleed and requires great mental strain over time lord s powers grew to the point where he could take full control of other beings even superman although it required a great deal of time and patience for him to establish the necessary level of control over the man of steel his powers made him such a threat to global security that wonder woman was forced to kill him after questioning him under the lasso of truth confirmed that his death was the only way to free superman when the character was resurrected following blackest night in the story justice league generation lost he prepared to erase the world s memories of his past criminal actions in order to survive the trauma to his brain he placed his body in a large tub of ice and hooked himself up to a blood transfusion machine the life entity somehow changed his abilities and would initially convert living people into the corpses of a black lantern 50 with his task completed lord was now fully restored he then exhibited voluntary activation and control over every resting o m a c infected within the global populace 51 following a company wide reboot lord was reintroduced as part of the dc rebirth publishing event now having been a metahuman since his youth his primary power is tweaked to a form of powerful psychic persuasion which works best when paired with a vocal command in this later depiction his powers work by exploiting and promoting people s underlying desires and inhibitions to make them do his bidding the only draw back being his power does not give him outright control over them as he can only push them to act on their own subconscious wants 52 for example he could draw out deadshot s subconscious desire to kill his daughter so that he could be free to kill anyone but when he used his power on killer frost he only drew out her desire to make a difference other versions edit earth one edit in wonder woman earth one maxwell lord is an expert entrepreneur

specifically those related to green lantern created by mike w barr len wein and joe staton the character who exists as an embodiment of death first appeared in tales of the green lantern corps 2 june 1981 1 he is the primary antagonist in the 2009 2010 blackest night storyline contents 1 publication history 1 1 origins 1 2 1990 2002 1 3 blackest night 1 4 brightest day 1 5 the new 52 1 6 dc rebirth 2 powers and abilities 3 other versions 3 1 flashpoint 3 2 star trek green lantern the spectrum war 4 in other media 5 references 6 external links publication history edit origins edit nekron as he first appeared in tales of the green lantern corps 2 art by joe staton nekron is the personification of death and ruler of a region adjoining hell known as the land of the unliving that also seems to border on limbo and purgatory within the dc universe it is where the souls of the dead await passage to their final residence in either the silver city or hell nekron draws his power from the souls and spirits of all those who have ever died 2 after the oan scientist krona was sentenced to banishment as pure energy that energy somehow reached nekron s realm a rift opens between the dimensions due to the paradox of an immortal now being in the realm of the dead desiring the living world he is now able to see but being too large to pass through the rift nekron recreates krona as an undead being of enormous power instead given an army of similarly restored spirits nekron sends krona to kill the guardians of the universe in order to increase the size of the rift krona cooperates because part of nekron s plan involves collapsing the universe so as to recreate it according to his own desires which would give krona the chance to see a universe being born krona and his minions kill several guardians and green lanterns while destroying the central power battery to prevent the lanterns from recharging their power rings although his attack is powerful enough to shatter the morale of the green lantern corps hal jordan manages to inspire and rally his fellow lanterns into attacking krona with the charge still left in their rings nekron is defeated when jordan enters the realm of the dead and incites the spirits of the recently killed lanterns to rebel against him this distraction undercuts krona s power supplied by the being and thus gives the guardians enough time to banish krona into the dead realm and close the rift with jordan still trapped inside the spirit of jordan s predecessor abin sur helps him escape the realm 3 1990 2002 edit captain atom has a run in with nekron in which nekron is described as death as the ultimate opponent black racer also making an appearance is coined death as an inevitability while death prominently known from her appearances in vertigo titles represents death as the release as mercy as compassion drawing into the quantum field captain atom is able to get the better of nekron and is able to visit his deceased wife 4 nekron later battles the demon nebiros following the destruction of doctor fate s tower of fate also appearing in this issue is jared stevens fate 5 kyle rayner later encounters nekron when he nearly reenters the living universe at a time when the level of supernatural activity mysteriously increases this gave nekron the opportunity to briefly control every deceased member of the green lantern corps which act as both his army and his anchor to the living universe kyle was able to push nekron back into his dimension by freeing the undead lanterns from nekron s control the rift is eventually sealed following nekron s defeat 6 nekron also encounters wonder woman and rebecca carstairs witchfire 7 blackest night edit in the blackest night storyline nekron is revealed to be responsible for the creation of the black power rings which reanimate the dead and is collaborating with scar and black hand he s also responsible for the capture of the anti monitor during the aftermath of the sinestro corps war on the planet ryut when the black lanterns power levels reach one hundred percent he rises from the earth just outside coast city 8 9 nekron is also revealed to be the true mastermind behind the miraculous resurrections of several superheroes in the past a deed previously thought to be a consequence of brother blood tampering with the forces of life and death 10 by allowing the dead heroes to be reborn he grants himself a small cadre of inside agents by briefly reanimating batman s clone created by darkseid during final crisis and implying that the dark lord s awareness of the remains is not authentic as an emotional tether to stimulate a powerful enough emotional response nekron is able to create black rings that latch on to superman wonder woman donna troy kid flash animal man ice green arrow and superboy transforming them all into black lanterns hal jordan and barry allen are similarly targeted but evade sharing their comrades fates thanks to barry taking himself and hal two seconds into the future and causing their would be rings to shut down 11 12 according to black lantern jean loring nekron was formed out of the nothingness in existence prior to the creation of the universe as a defense mechanism to the white light the guardian of darkness 11 12 given shape in the form of life s idea of death nekron marches with his undead army claiming the hunger plaguing him has not abated 12 nekron is not a living being but just exists as an avatar of darkness from the beginning of the universe this makes nekron immune to the spectre s divine wrath as he has no soul to judge and he is not unlike a natural disaster 13 nekron then begins to reveal the full extent of his plan nekron and his black lanterns bring the subdued guardians to a clearing where the same symbol that was seen on professor zoom s chest is drawn in what appears to be blood after questioning one of the guardians and getting him to admit that he can no longer remember why the guardians took a vow to protect the universe nekron slits his throat and black hand removes his organs and places them in the center of the symbol after crushing the organs with his scythe nekron calls forth the entity the entity is the white light given physical form when nekron strikes the entity every living thing in the universe cries out in pain this is because the entity is what gave birth to life and all living things came from it nekron intends to kill the entity and thereby kill every living thing in the universe his plans however are thwarted when sinestro bonds with the entity becoming a white lantern 14 another failure comes when the massed corps above earth reach xanshi s core through its surface faults and manage to destroy the thousands of rings holding it together as xanshi collapses nekron cries out in pain while he also manages to nearly hack sinestro in half with his scythe he fails to kill him and the white lantern rises again healing his wounds and promising retribution to nekron 15 in the battle that follows the life entity eventually abandons sinestro refusing to be controlled by his ego and bonds itself to hal jordan who states that nekron merely opened the doors between life and death while it was still the heroes choices to return to life having restored all the resurrected heroes to life and recruited them to the white lantern corps hal turns the power of the entity on black hand deadman having discovered that black hand functions as nekron s link to the living world causing black hand to return to life and vomiting one white power ring that enters the black power battery and resurrects the anti monitor destroying the power battery in the process who immediately attacks nekron nekron then returns the anti monitor to the anti matter universe twelve other white rings are then released by black hand and seek out several deceased heroes and villains who had been recruited into the black lantern corps the rings restoring all twelve of them to life in the final confrontation that follows nekron is banished yet again with hal jordan and barry allen speculating that death will now be more permanent with nekron s plan having failed 16 brightest day edit at the conclusion of the miniseries brightest day swamp thing appears grown to towering size and emerging from the forest at the former heart of star city which has become corrupted 17 the white lantern entity explains that just as the memories of alec holland acted as a template for the earth elemental the personality of nekron has been imprinted over it the corrupted swamp thing does battle with alec holland having been resurrected and turned into the new swamp thing by the white lantern entity who is aided by embodiments of the four elements hawkman hawkwoman firestorm aquaman and the martian manhunter and is defeated driving out the influence of nekron once again 18 the new 52 edit in the new 52 reboot of dc s continuity at the conclusion of the wrath of the first lantern hal jordan makes the ultimate sacrifice and kills himself so he could harness the power of black hand s ring in order to escape the dead zone and stop the first lantern volthoom after a fierce battle with volthoom winning the upper hand hal proceeds to summon nekron so that the guardian of darkness could destroy volthoom for good while nekron refuses at first to obey hal s command jordan who was now his link to the living world eventually manages to control nekron who finally kills volthoom a nearby green lantern ring chooses hal to be its user and reverses him from being a black lantern returning him to life as green lantern once more hal s final act as a black lantern is to send nekron back to his tomb in the dead zone 19 dc rebirth edit during dc rebirth nekron returns and confronts volthoom allowing him to sing within the dead zone after recounting his history to nekron volthoom pleads with him to end his life however nekron reveals that he cannot as volthoom s bond with the emotional spectrum is profound and permanent meaning that as long as there is light in the universe volthoom will never die 20 powers and abilities edit the

eldest son of darkseid the half brother of orion and grayven and an enemy of superman and the justice league 1 2 created by jack kirby being debuted with the rest of the new gods first appearing in new gods 1 february 1971 in an era called the silver age of comic books he is originally and recurrently depicted as the brutish son of darkseid commonly seeking affection of his father who he had a tragic childhood with he is also depicted as second in command as leader of apokolips and rival to another of darkseid son orion 3 kalibak s name is derived from the william shakespeare character name

clearly respects orion over his first born unlike orion kalibak secretly craves the love and respect of his father something neither he nor anyone else can ever hope to attain and it has been shown that he has a gentle side which is completely submerged under his brutish exterior and which he consistently and fearfully keeps hidden because on apokolips any sign of weakness is subject to the cruelest punishment for his part darkseid is more lenient towards kalibak s failures than those of his other servants having slain him he always returns him to life it is implied this is because his eldest son is the offspring of the one person darkseid truly loved as well being one of the only few of his followers with genuine loyalty at one point kalibak is desperate enough to confront orion without darkseid s consent kalibak s scheme fell apart and he kills his accomplice desaad also a servant of darkseid to cover his tracks darkseid was not pleased when he found out and reduced his son

apokolips and new genesis as an agent of the source wall in death of the new gods in final crisis the new fifth world and human version of kalibak appears alongside darkseid calling himself dark side

of batman first appearing in the batman the animated series episode night of the ninja kyodai ken was once the star pupil of yoru a top martial artist in japan but his morality left a lot to be desired kyodai found a less than worthy rival in the form of a foreigner named bruce wayne a sparring session between bruce and kyodai ended with kyodai the winner who scoffed at bruce s background his boastfulness was put in check by yoru who proceeded to floor kyodai with advanced moves warning that there is always someone better and that a good martial artist is ethical and respectful to others one night kyodai attempted to steal yoru s prized sword but was confronted by bruce yoru halted the forthcoming fight reclaimed the sword and expelled kyodai from the dojo kyodai s pain was so great that he resettled in the city somewhere in the uramachi district kyodai contracted himself as the assassin for hire the ninja 78 years later kyodai traveled to gotham city as the ninja in order to exact revenge on bruce he began by committing several stings of corporate sabotage on seven wayne industries branches while trying to break into wayne cosmetics batman intervened and when he displayed his stance kyodai realized batman was bruce wayne batman also realized his identity as well after a batarang from robin cut the cloth on his back revealing a menacing tattoo that kyodai had during his training he kidnapped bruce and indirectly summer gleeson after a gotham charities reception there he revealed his plot while he hated bruce for getting him kicked out of the dojo he also hated that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth the purpose for his robberies of wayne industries was to hack into the finances of the companies then transfer them to his bank account summer said the thefts made him a petty crook but kyodai mildly scoffed at that saying by all the subterfuge he had committed it made him a clever thief bruce was able to escape after robin had distracted kyodai but was unable to fight him as he would expose his alter ego to gleeson fortunately robin restricted gleeson s view allowing bruce to fight and overpower kyodai instead of surrendering kyodai dove into a nearby river and escaped in his follow up episode day of the samurai kyodai returned to japan and became intent on learning yoru s ultimate technique the 牙の方向 kiba no houkou way of the fang s 大眠り o nemuri big sleep touch which was capable of killing a man in a single blow he kidnapped yoru s student kairi and blackmailed her into giving him the location of the hidden scrolls containing the technique instructions however time had made the scrolls fragile and they fell apart upon contact but kyodai still managed to learn the touch from a recovered fragment he kidnapped alfred pennyworth and lured bruce to mount kajiiki for a final showdown when bruce discovered his hideout kyodai used the touch but it failed because bruce wore a protective pad to defend the death point when the volcano erupted kyodai was stranded on a melting rock bruce attempted to save him but kyodai silently acknowledging him as a worthy opponent bowed to him before another explosion of lava came between them and kyodai had vanished kyodai s fate is unrevealed however as he was not seen or heard from again it is more than likely that he perished in the explosion he was voiced by

about the blackest night so that he might stop the prophecy s fulfillment during his quest abin sur begins to lose his faith in his willpower and his ring and begins to feel fear his weakened willpower results in his ring creating correspondingly weaker constructs allowing his prisoner atrocitus to break free and attack him and cause his ship to crash on earth abin sur is critically injured in the crash leading him to instruct his ring to seek out a successor and the ring chose hal jordan 12 his discovery of the prophecy from the five inversions was noted in the book of oa 13

abin sur had discovered the indigo light on the planet nok during a mission which he along with natromo forged it into a battery with abin sur bringing indigo 1 who was allegedly his worst enemy and responsible for the death of his daughter to the planet to become the first indigo tribe all subsequent members of the tribe being selected as the worst psychopaths of their worlds abin sur did this as he foresaw the danger that the guardians of the universe would pose once the blackest night had passed and sought to find a way to stop the guardians by changing them due to the impossibility of killing them 24 dc rebirth edit subsequently in dc rebirth abin sur appears in an unknown world of emerald space where the green lantern corps were memorial in the afterlife when hal jordan is

simon baz bring molites to ungara but not all are welcoming simon and jessica make friends with several ungarans who honor the nobility of abin sur and thus have no problems with the molites 27 spaceship edit the question was raised of why abin sur needed a ship but in the green lantern origins serial it is stated that out of paranoia of the prophecy of his destruction he navigated the cosmos in a ship filled with weapons not trusting the powers of his ring as the prophecy stated that his ring would fail him when he needed it most pre crisis explanation edit in the story earth s first green lantern jordan revealed that he wondered that himself and asked his ring to explain the ring told the story of how abin sur found a world which was still at a middle age stage of advancement even though it should have been in the atomic age and discovered a parasitic energy being species that fed on sentient beings i factor a substance that enabled inventiveness attacking civilizations and stalling their development as they had no i factor themselves sur captured them to stop their destruction placing them in a bubble but one of their number had escaped as it was attacking another world and vowed to free his brethren to do so he tracked down sur s planet and created a disaster by making a volcano erupt to force him to appear to stop it since sur did not mask himself the being recognized him immediately and followed him to his home as sur neglected to charge his ring before going to sleep he was unable to stop the being from taking control of him with the being in control of his body and about to force him to go and free his fellows sur tricked the being into thinking that he would not be able to do so because the ring would be low on power after the trip there while in reality the ring s charge is purely time based the being decided to have sur take a ship to the destination but before leaving sur managed to get a hold of his invisible power battery without the creature noticing on the ship sur piloted the ship and waited until he moved into a green colored planetary radiation belt which allowed sur to charge his ring without the being noticing as his ring glowed green when recharging thus armed sur battled and captured the being sending it of into orbit of the same star that his fellow beings were imprisoned at however during the fight the ship wandered into earth s radiation belt with his ring useless sur lost control of the battered ship and crashed mortally wounded sur sought out his replacement and drew jordan to him jordan learnt of this from the ring according to jordan this account prompted him to keep a secret identity as a security precaution and to carefully navigate around earth s radiation belts post crisis explanation edit in tales of the green lantern corps annual 2 1986 story tygers writer alan moore answered the question with a story of how the hero once visited ysmault a prison planet for an ancient race of demons the empire of tears vanquished millennia ago by the oans he was on a rescue mission and felt he could not wait for instruction from the guardians while there abin sur met a demon named qull of the five inversions a humanoid with a gaping mouth in his chest and a tongue shaped head crucified by three glowing spikes topped with the symbol of the green lantern corps this unholy messiah predicted the hero would die when his power ring ran out of energy at a critical moment while he was fighting an opponent or unprotected in hard vacuum abin sur worried by this prophecy began using a starship for interstellar voyages as an additional safeguard a decade later fleeing his enemy his spaceship collided with a girdle of yellow radiation around earth that rendered his starship and his power ring useless within moments had he relied on his ring alone he realized he might have tested the planet s magnetosphere before rashly entering it thus while legion may have wounded him it could be argued that it was qull that was actually responsible for abin sur s death having sown the seeds of doubt in the green lantern s mind green lantern secret origin edit main article green lantern secret origin in the secret origins arc green lantern vol 4 abin sur s final fate was tweaked again to incorporate elements of the parallax impurity still forced to use a
