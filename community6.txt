and the rogues make their first full length appearance in the flash vol 5 15 where they are attempting to steal a valuable golden statue of the god mercury from the small island nation of corto maltese the flash arrives to stop them but they turn out to be constructs of mirror master laid so that the rogues can commit a crime spree in central city captain cold reveals what he had been

the villains that attend the underground meeting held by riddler that talks about the superman theory 23 powers and abilities edit like the majority of the flash s rogues snart had no innate superhuman powers he instead relied on his cold guns and instincts over the years snart had modified his weapons to allow a variety of effects such as a cold beam that freezes anything it hits instantly creating a cold field where people and objects literally stop in their tracks cold uses this ability to slow down the flash s movements bathing his opponent in a wide beam of ice designed to freeze the skin of the target so they stay conscious and do not go numb to the pain cold used this to kill chillblaine who murdered cold s sister to make him suffer as much as possible creating a slippery field of ice which can slow down the flash forming sharp stalagmites on the ground to impale his enemies used to kill chillblaine after freezing the outer layer of his skin so he could inflict as much pain as possible an ice grenade which was stated to turn this place into an iceberg used to freeze everything in a large radius and the whole of iron heights during the events of blackest night creating mirages out of extreme cold like heat fellow ice based villain mr freeze has noted that cold is the only cold themed villain in the dc universe to have mastered absolute zero with his weapons in the new 52 universe captain cold temporarily had meta human ice powers including the power to slow down the flash or objects traveling at high velocities via molecular deceleration caused by absolute zero but these powers are later lost in the forever evil series when he is attacked by deathstorm the earth 3 counterpart of firestorm with cold reverting to using his classic ice gun despite his lack of professional or technical expertise cold states that he spent so long analyzing the parts of his cold gun that he is able to recreate it in just over half an hour using parts stolen from a standard electronics shop 24 he s even skilled enough to program it for a host of unique effects simulating some of his powers like his cold field which quick cools the atmosphere to the point that everything caught in it grinds to a halt 25 or an auto activation function which triggers his cold gun s freeze ray via vocalized password input 22 during the rebirth storyline snart augmented his cold gun even further by combining it with the anti speed force technologies by the science criminal cell called black hole 26 the newly christened black ice gun now tacked directly into the speed force in order to painfully disrupt a speedster s connection to it snart s new cold gun was so powerful that not only could it hinder the flash in the most excruciating way possible it was vastly more powerful in scope able to freeze both the harbor and several city blocks adjacent to their current location 27 other versions edit captain cold appears in darwyn cooke s series dc the new

considered acceptable forms in english 11 pronounced katana the kun yomi japanese reading of the kanji 刀 originally meaning single edged blade of any length in chinese the word has been adopted as a loanword by the portuguese 12 in portuguese the designation spelled catana means large knife or machete 12 description edit mei signature and nakago tang of an edo period katana the katana is generally defined as the standard sized moderately curved as opposed to the older tachi featuring more curvature japanese sword with a blade length greater than 60 6 cm 23 86 inches japanese 2 shaku 13 it is characterized by its distinctive appearance a curved slender single edged blade with a circular or squared guard tsuba and long grip to accommodate two hands 13 with a few exceptions katana and tachi can be distinguished from each other if signed by the location of the signature mei on the tang nakago in general the mei should be carved into the side of the nakago which would face outward when the sword was worn since a tachi was worn with the cutting edge down and the katana was worn with the cutting edge up the mei would be in opposite locations on the tang 14 western historians have said that katana were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history 15 16 however the main weapons on the battlefield in the sengoku period in the 15th century were yumi bow yari spear and tanegashima gun and katana and tachi were used only for close combat during this period the tactics changed to a group battle by ashigaru foot soldiers mobilized in large numbers so naginata and tachi became obsolete as weapons on the battlefield and were replaced by yari and katana 17 18 19 in the relatively peaceful edo period katana increased in importance as a weapon and at the end of the edo period shishi political activists fought many battles using katana as their main weapon katana and tachi were often used as gifts between daimyo feudal lord and samurai or as offerings to the kami enshrined in shinto shrines and symbols of authority and spirituality of samurai 18 20 19 17 history edit see also japanese sword history the production of swords in japan is

century kamakura period important cultural property tokyo national museum muramasa 勢州桑名住村正 from the tokyo national museum katana originates from sasuga 刺刀 a kind of tantō short sword or knife used by lower ranking samurai who fought on foot in the kamakura period 1185 1333 their main weapon was a long naginata and sasuga was a spare weapon in the nanboku chō period 1336 1392 which corresponds to the early muromachi period 1336 1573 long weapons such as ōdachi were popular and along with this sasuga lengthened and finally became katana 22 23 also there is a theory that koshigatana 腰刀 a kind of tantō which was equipped by high ranking samurai together with tachi developed to katana through the same historical background as sasuga and it is possible that both developed to katana 24 the oldest katana in existence today is called hishizukuri uchigatana which was forged in the nanbokuchō period and was dedicated to kasuga shrine later 1 the first use of katana as a word to describe a long sword that was different from a tachi occurs as early as the kamakura period 13 these references to uchigatana and tsubagatana seem to indicate a different style of sword possibly a less costly sword for lower ranking warriors starting around the year 1400 long swords signed with the katana style mei were made this was in response to samurai wearing their tachi in what is now called katana style cutting edge up japanese swords are traditionally worn with the mei facing away from the wearer when a tachi was worn in the style of a katana with the cutting edge up the tachi s signature would be facing the wrong way the fact that swordsmiths started signing swords with a katana signature shows that some samurai of that time period had started wearing their swords in a different manner 25 26 traditionally yumi bows were the main weapon of war in japan and tachi and naginata were used only for close combat the ōnin war in the late 15th century in the muromachi period expanded into a large scale domestic war in which employed farmers called ashigaru were mobilized in large numbers they fought on foot using katana shorter than tachi in the sengoku period period of warring states in the late muromachi period the war became bigger and ashigaru fought in a close formation using yari spears lent to them furthermore in the late 16th century tanegashima muskets were introduced from portugal and japanese swordsmiths mass produced improved products with ashigaru fighting with leased guns on the battlefield in japan guns and spears became main weapons in addition to bows due to the changes in fighting styles in these wars the tachi and naginata became obsolete among samurai and the katana which was easy to carry became the mainstream the dazzling looking tachi gradually became a symbol of the authority of high ranking samurai 22 20 19 on the other hand kenjutsu swordsmanship that makes use of the characteristics of katana was invented the quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times the practice and martial art for drawing the sword quickly and responding to a sudden attack was called battōjutsu which is still kept alive through the teaching of iaido the katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt like sash obi with the sharpened edge facing up ideally samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion previously the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt 13 27 from the 15th century low quality swords were mass produced under the influence of the large scale war these swords along with spears were lent to recruited farmers called ashigaru and swords were exported such mass produced swords are called kazuuchimono and swordsmiths of the bisen school and mino school produced them by division of labor 22 28 the export of katana and tachi reached its peak during this period from the late 15th century to early 16th century when at least 200 000 swords were shipped to ming dynasty china in official trade in an attempt to soak up the production of japanese weapons and make it harder for pirates in the area to arm in the ming dynasty of china japanese swords and their tactics were studied to repel pirates and wodao and miaodao were developed based on japanese swords 2 29 30 from this period the tang nakago of many old tachi were cut and shortened into katana this kind of remake is called suriage 磨上げ 4 for example many of the tachi that masamune forged during the kamakura period were converted into katana so his only existing works are katana and tantō 31 daishō style handachi sword mounting 16th 17th century azuchi momoyama or edo period from the late muromachi period sengoku period to the early edo period samurai were sometimes equipped with a katana blade pointing downwards like a tachi this style of sword is called handachi half tachi in handachi both styles were often mixed for example fastening to the obi was katana style but metalworking of the scabbard was tachi style 32 in the muromachi period especially the sengoku period people such as farmers townspeople and monks could have a sword however in 1588 toyotomi hideyoshi banned farmers from owning weapons and conducted a sword hunt to forcibly remove swords from anyone identifying as a farmer 24 the length of the katana blade varied considerably during the course of its history in the late 14th and early 15th centuries katana blades tended to have lengths between 70 and 73 centimetres 28 and 29 in during the early 16th century the average length dropped about 10 centimetres 3 9 in approaching closer to 60 centimetres 24 in by the late 16th century the average length had increased again by about 13 centimetres 5 1 in returning to approximately 73 centimetres 29 in 27 shintō new swords edit antique japanese daishō the traditional pairing of two japanese swords which were the symbol of the samurai showing the traditional japanese sword cases koshirae and the difference in size between the katana bottom and the smaller wakizashi top swords forged after 1596 in the keichō period of the azuchi momoyama period are classified as shintō new swords japanese swords after shintō are different from kotō in forging method and steel tamahagane this is thought to be because bizen school which was the largest swordsmith group of japanese swords was destroyed by a great flood in 1590 and the mainstream shifted to mino school and because toyotomi hideyoshi virtually unified japan uniform steel began to be distributed throughout japan the kotō swords especially the bizen school swords made in the kamakura period had a midare utsuri like a white mist between hamon and shinogi but in the swords after shintō it has almost disappeared in addition the whole body of the blade became whitish and hard almost no one was able to reproduce midare utsurii until kunihira kawachi reproduced it in 2014 33 34 sword fittings tsuba top left and fuchigashira top right made by ishiguro masayoshi in the 18th or 19th century kogai middle and kozuka bottom made by yanagawa naomasa in

highly intricate and well respected art form lacquered saya scabbards ornate engraved fittings silk handles and elegant tsuba handguards were popular among samurai in the edo period and eventually especially when japan was in peace time katana became more cosmetic and ceremonial items than practical weapons 35 the umetada school led by umetada myoju who was considered to be the founder of shinto led the improvement of the artistry of japanese swords in this period they were both swordsmiths and metalsmiths and were famous for carving the blade making metal accouterments such as tsuba handguard remodeling from tachi to katana suriage and inscriptions inlaid with gold 36 during this period the tokugawa shogunate required samurai to wear katana and shorter swords in pairs these short swords were wakizashi and tantō and wakizashi were mainly selected this set of two is called a daishō only samurai could wear the daishō it represented their social power and personal honour 13 27 37 samurai could wear decorative sword mountings in their daily lives but the tokugawa shogunate regulated the formal sword that samurai wore when visiting a castle by regulating it as a daisho made of a black scabbard a hilt wrapped with white ray skin and black string 38 japanese swords made in this period are classified as shintō 39 shinshintō new new swords edit daishō katana and wakizashi forged by minamoto no kiyomaro 1848 late edo period not to scale daishō for formal attire with black scabbard hilt winding thread and white ray skin hilt which were regulated by the tokugawa shogunate daishō owned by uesugi clan late edo period in the late 18th century swordsmith suishinshi masahide criticized that the present katana blades only emphasized decoration and had a problem with their toughness he insisted that the bold and strong kotō blade from the kamakura period to the nanboku chō period was the ideal japanese sword and started a movement to restore the production method and apply it to katana katana made after this is classified as a shinshintō 39 one of the most popular swordsmiths in japan today is minamoto kiyomaro who was active in this shinshintō period his popularity is due to his timeless exceptional skill as he was nicknamed masamune in yotsuya after his disastrous life his works were traded at high prices and exhibitions were held at museums all over japan from 2013 to 2014 40 41 42 the idea that the blade of a sword in the kamakura period is the best has been continued until now and as of the 21st century 80 of japanese swords designated as national treasure in japan were made in the kamakura period and 70 of them were tachi 43 44 the arrival of matthew perry in 1853 and the subsequent convention of kanagawa caused chaos in japanese society conflicts began to occur frequently between the forces of sonnō jōi 尊王攘夷派 who wanted to overthrow the tokugawa shogunate and rule by the emperor and the forces of sabaku 佐幕派 who wanted the tokugawa shogunate to continue these political activists called the shishi 志士 fought using a practical katana called the kinnōtō 勤皇刀 or the bakumatsutō 幕末刀 their katana were often longer than 90 cm 35 43 in in blade length less curved and had a big and sharp point which was advantageous for stabbing in indoor battles 39 gendaitō modern or contemporary swords edit meiji world war ii edit katana mountings decorated with maki e lacquer in the 1800s although the number of forged swords decreased in the meiji period many artistically excellent mountings were made during the meiji period the samurai class was gradually disbanded and the special privileges granted to them were taken away including the right to carry swords in public the haitōrei edict in 1876 forbade the carrying of swords in public except for certain individuals such as former samurai lords daimyō the military and the police 45 skilled swordsmiths had trouble making a living during this period as japan modernized its military and many swordsmiths started making other items such as farm equipment tools and cutlery the craft of making swords was kept alive through the efforts of some individuals notably miyamoto kanenori 宮本包則 1830 1926 and gassan sadakazu 月山貞一 1836 1918 who were appointed imperial household artist the businessman mitsumura toshimo 光村利藻 1877 1955 tried to preserve their skills by ordering swords and sword mountings from the swordsmiths and craftsmen he was especially enthusiastic about collecting sword mountings and he collected about 3 000 precious sword mountings from the end of the edo period to the meiji period about 1200 items from a part of his collection are now in the nezu museum 46 47 48 military action by japan in china and russia during the meiji period helped revive interest in swords but it was not until the shōwa period that swords were produced on a large scale again 49 japanese military swords produced between 1875 and 1945 are referred to as guntō military swords 50 type 95 world war ii era guntō during the pre world war ii military buildup and throughout the war all japanese officers were required to wear a sword traditionally made swords were produced during this period but in order to supply such large numbers of swords blacksmiths with little or no knowledge of traditional japanese sword manufacture were recruited in addition supplies of the japanese steel tamahagane used for swordmaking were limited so several other types of steel were also used quicker methods of forging were also used such as the use of power hammers and quenching the blade in oil rather than hand forging and water the non traditionally made swords from this period are called shōwatō after the regnal name of the emperor hirohito and in 1937 the japanese government started requiring the use of special stamps on the tang nakago to distinguish these swords from traditionally made swords during this period of war older antique swords were remounted for use in military mounts presently in japan shōwatō are not considered to be true japanese swords and they can be confiscated outside japan however they are collected as historical artifacts 45 49 51 post world war ii edit japanese girl practicing iaidō with a modern training katana or iaitō this sword was custom made in japan to suit the weight and size of the student the blade is made of aluminum alloy and lacks a sharp edge for safety reasons between 1945 and 1953 sword manufacture and sword related martial arts were banned in japan many swords were confiscated and destroyed and swordsmiths were not able to make a living since 1953 japanese swordsmiths have been allowed to work but with severe restrictions swordsmiths must be licensed and serve a five year apprenticeship and only licensed swordsmiths are allowed to produce japanese swords nihonto only two longswords per month are allowed to be produced by each swordsmith and all swords must be registered with the japanese government 52 outside japan some of the modern katanas being produced by western swordsmiths use modern steel alloys such as l6 and a2 these modern swords replicate the size and shape of the japanese katana and are used by martial artists for iaidō and even for cutting practice tameshigiri mass produced swords including iaitō and shinken in the shape of katana are available from many countries though china dominates the market 53 these types of swords are typically mass produced and made with a wide variety of steels and methods according to the parliamentary association for the preservation and promotion of japanese swords organized by japanese diet members many katana distributed around the world as of the 21st century are fake japanese swords made in china the sankei shimbun analyzed that this is because the japanese government allowed swordsmiths to make only 24 japanese swords per person per year in order to maintain the quality of japanese swords 54 55 many swordsmiths after the edo period have tried to reproduce the sword of the kamakura period which is considered as the best sword in the history of japanese swords but they have failed then in 2014 kunihira kawachi succeeded in reproducing it and won the masamune prize the highest honor as a swordsmith no one could win the masamune prize unless he made an extraordinary achievement and in the section of tachi and katana no one had won for 18 years before kawauchi 34 types edit katana are distinguished by their type of blade shinogi zukuri is the most common blade shape for japanese katana that provides both speed and cutting power it features a distinct yokote a line or bevel that separates the finish of the main blade and the finish of the tip shinogi zukuri was originally produced after the heian period shobu zukuri is a variation of shinogi zukuri without a yokote the distinct angle between the long cutting edge and the point section instead the edge curves smoothly and uninterrupted into the point kissaki moroha zukuri is a katana blade shape with a distinctive curved and double edged blade one edge of the blade is shaped in normal katana fashion while the tip is symmetrical and both edges of the blade are sharp forging and construction edit main articles japanese swordsmithing and japanese sword mountings named parts of a katana cross sections of japanese sword blade lamination methods typical features of japanese swords represented by katana and tachi are a three dimensional cross sectional shape of an elongated pentagonal to hexagonal blade called shinogi zukuri a style in which the blade and the tang nakago are integrated and fixed to the hilt tsuka with a pin called mekugi and a gentle curve when a shinogi zukuri sword is viewed from the side there is a ridge line of the thickest part of the blade called shinogi between the cutting edge side and the back side this shinogi contributes to lightening and toughening of the blade and high cutting ability 56 katana are traditionally made from a specialized japanese steel called tamahagane 57 which is created from a traditional smelting process that results in several layered steels with different carbon concentrations 58 this process helps remove impurities and even out the carbon content of the steel the age of the steel plays a role in the ability to remove impurities with older steel having a higher oxygen concentration being more easily stretched and rid of impurities during hammering resulting in a stronger blade 59 the smith begins by folding and welding pieces of the steel several times to work out most of the differences in the steel the resulting block of steel is then drawn out to form a billet at this stage it is only slightly curved or may have no curve at all the katana s gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker but generally composed of clay water and any or none of ash grinding stone powder or rust this process is called tsuchioki the edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword heated and then quenched in water few sword makers use oil to quench the blade the slurry causes only the blade s edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro structures in the steel 27 when steel with a carbon content of 0 7 is heated beyond 750 c it enters the austenite phase when austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water the structure changes into martensite which is a very hard form of steel when austenite is allowed to cool slowly its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite 60 61 this process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the hamon which is made distinct by polishing each hamon and each smith s style of hamon is distinct 27 example of a hamon after the blade is forged it is then sent to be polished the polishing takes between one and three weeks the polisher uses a series of successively finer grains of polishing stones in a process called glazing until the blade has a mirror finish however the blunt edge of the katana is often given a matte finish to emphasize the hamon 27 japanese swords are generally made by a division of labor between six and eight craftsmen tosho toko katanakaji is in charge of forging blades togishi is in charge of polishing blades kinkosi chokinshi is in charge of making metal fittings for sword fittings shiroganeshi is in charge of making habaki brade collar sayashi is in charge of making scabbards nurishi is in charge of applying lacquer to scabbards tsukamakishi is in charge of making hilt and tsubashi is in charge of making tsuba hand guard tosho use apprentice swordsmiths as assistants prior to the muromachi period tosho and kacchushi armorer used surplus metal to make tsuba but from the muromachi period onwards specialized craftsmen began to make tsuba nowadays kinkoshi sometimes serves as shiroganeshi and tsubashi 62 63 appreciation edit historically katana have been regarded not only as weapons but also as works of art especially for high quality ones for a long time japanese people have developed a unique appreciation method in which the blade is regarded as the core of their aesthetic evaluation rather than the sword mountings decorated with luxurious lacquer or metal works 64 65 it is said that the following three objects are the most noteworthy objects when appreciating a blade the first is the overall shape referred to as sugata curvature length width tip and shape of tang of the sword are the objects for appreciation the second is a fine pattern on the surface of the blade which is referred to as hada or jigane by repeatedly folding and forging the blade fine patterns such as fingerprints tree rings and bark are formed on its surface the third is hamon hamon is a white pattern of the cutting edge produced by quenching and tempering the object of appreciation is the shape of hammon and the crystal particles formed at the boundary of hammon depending on the size of the particles they can be divided into two types a nie and a nioi which makes them look like stars or mist in addition to these three objects a swordsmith signature and a file pattern engraved on tang and a carving inscribed on the blade which is referred to as horimono are also the objects of appreciation 64 65 a japanese sword authentication paper origami from 1702 that hon ami kōchū certified a tantō made by yukimitsu in the 14th century as authentic the hon ami clan which was an authority of appraisal of japanese swords rated japanese swords from these artistic points of view in addition experts of modern japanese swords judge when and by which swordsmith school the sword was made from these artistic points of view 64 65 generally the blade and the sword mounting of japanese swords are displayed separately in museums and this tendency is remarkable in japan for example the nagoya japanese sword museum nagoya touken world one of japan s largest sword museums posts separate videos of the blade and the sword mounting on its official website and youtube 66 67 rating of japanese swords and swordsmiths edit in japan japanese swords are rated by authorities of each period and some of the authority of the rating is still valid today in 1719 tokugawa yoshimune the 8th shogun of the tokugawa shogunate ordered hon ami kōchū who was an authority of sword appraisal to record swords possessed by daimyo all over japan in books in the completed kyōhō meibutsu chō 享保名物帳 249 precious swords were described and additional 25 swords were described later the list also includes 81 swords that had been destroyed in previous fires the precious swords described in this book were called meibutsu 名物 and the criteria for selection were artistic elements origins and legends the list of meibutsu includes 59 swords made by masamune 34 by awataguchi yoshimitsu and 22 by go yoshihiro and these three swordsmiths were considered special daimyo hid some swords for fear that they would be confiscated by the tokugawa shogunate so even some precious swords were not listed in the book for example daihannya nagamitsu and yamatorige which are now designated as national treasures were not listed 43 katana forged by nagasone kotetsu the letters inlaid with gold on the tang nakago indicated that yamano kauemon 山野加右衛門 the official executioner of the tokugawa shogunate and examiner of sword cutting performance cut the four human torso overlapped 68 yamada asaemon v who was the official sword cutting ability examiner and executioner of the tokugawa shogunate published a book kaiho kenjaku 懐宝剣尺 in 1797 in which he ranked the cutting ability of swords the book lists 228 swordsmiths whose forged swords are called wazamono 業物 and the highest saijo ō wazamono 最上大業物 has 12 selected in the reprinting in 1805 one swordsmith was added to the highest grade and in the major revised edition in 1830 kokon kajibiko 古今鍛冶備考 two swordsmiths were added to the highest grade and in the end 15 swordsmiths were ranked as the highest grade the katana forged by nagasone kotetsu one of the top rated swordsmith became very popular at the time when the book was published and many counterfeits were made in these books the three swordsmiths treated specially in kyōhō meibutsu chō and muramasa who was famous at that time for forging swords with high cutting ability were not mentioned the reasons for this are considered to be that yamada was afraid of challenging the authority of the shogun that he could not use the precious sword

the battlefield and for practicing several martial arts and modern martial artists still use a variety of katana martial arts in which training with katana is used include aikidō iaijutsu battōjutsu iaidō kenjutsu kendō ninjutsu and tenshin shōden katori shintō ryū 72 73 74 however for safety reasons katana used for martial arts are usually blunt edged to reduce the risk of injury sharp katana are only really used during tameshigiri blade testing where a practitioner practices cutting a bamboo or tatami straw post storage and maintenance edit if mishandled in its storage or maintenance the katana may become irreparably damaged the blade should be stored horizontally in its sheath curve down and edge facing upward to maintain the edge it is extremely important that the blade remain well oiled powdered and polished as the natural moisture residue from the hands of the user will rapidly cause the blade to rust if not cleaned off the traditional oil used is chōji oil 99 mineral oil and 1 clove oil for fragrance similarly when stored for longer periods it is important that the katana be inspected frequently and aired out if necessary in order to prevent rust or mold from forming mold may feed off the salts in the oil used to polish the blade 75 world records edit multiple sword world records were made with a katana and verified by guinness world records iaido master isao machii set the record for most martial arts katana cuts to one mat suegiri 76 fastest 1 000 martial arts sword cuts 77 most sword cuts to straw mats in three minutes 78 and fastest tennis ball 708km h cut by sword 79 there are various records for tameshigiri for example the greek agisilaos vesexidis set the record for most martial arts sword cuts in one minute 73 on 25 june 2016 80 ownership and trade restrictions edit republic of ireland edit under the firearms and offensive weapons act 1990 offensive weapons amendment order 2009 katanas made post 1953 are illegal unless made by hand according to traditional methods 81 united kingdom edit as of april 2008 the british government added swords with a curved blade of 50 cm 20 in or over in length the length of the blade shall be the straight line distance from the top of the handle to the tip of the blade to the offensive weapons order 82 this ban was a response to reports that samurai swords were used in more than 80 attacks and four killings over the preceding four years 83 those who violate the ban would be jailed up to six months and charged a fine of 5 000 martial arts practitioners historical re enactors and others may still own such swords the sword can also be legal provided it was made in japan before 1954 or was made using traditional sword making methods it is also legal to buy if it can be classed as a martial artist s weapon this ban applies to england wales scotland and northern ireland this ban was amended in august 2008 to allow sale and ownership without licence of traditional hand forged katana 84 gallery edit

writer gail simone contents 1 fictional history 2 white canary 3 powers and abilities 4 references fictional history edit twenty five years ago there was this legendary fighter by the name of huang undefeatable supposedly killed three men once without waking up from a nap as he grew older his heart grew bitter at the thought of his eventual defeat so he decided to pass along his gifts he believed in the chinese zodiac and set about having a son born under each sign he took many wives each child who had the misfortune of being born a girl or in the wrong year was killed immediately and each child who lived was branded he trained them brutally made them all twisted inside nurtured their hateful aspects and then before the year of their thirteenth birthday he asked them to kill him so he would never be defeated and would live on defeating his enemies throughout eternity black canary from birds of prey 81 by gail simone the twelve brothers in silk 12 martial artists named after the signs of the chinese zodiac first appeared in the employ of mister tan a singaporean drug lord posing as american mobsters wildcat and black canary attempted to fool mister tan into selling them all of his drugs which would ultimately cripple his operations while simultaneously depriving the real american mafia of one of their main drug suppliers led by huang chao ran the brother known as rabbit the twelve brothers monitored black canary and wildcat during these dealings attempting to determine if they were legitimate their attempts to force canary and wildcat to reveal their true identities failed and culminated in a spar between rabbit and black canary that was interrupted by a furious mister tan mister tan realized that he had been set up after agreeing to the terms that black canary stipulated and in an attempt to avoid being ruined he arranged for a real mob group to buy his drug shipment the twelve brothers accompanied the shipment to protect it and met black canary and a group of fighters in america the two groups agreed to a duel black canary s team consisted of wildcat richard dragon green arrow ii connor hawke savant creote huntress and herself before the fight could end in one side s clear defeat however black canary signaled her teammate lady blackhawk to attack the drug shipment destroying it black canary then gave rabbit an ultimatum with the shipment destroyed he had already failed in his mission the only way the brothers could be sure to walk away with their record of never losing intact was to call a draw rabbit agreed and the groups parted ways comics

children born to huang was spared after lightning appeared on the day of her birth and killed her midwife making huang believe that something powerful wanted her to live 1 she was trained by her brothers in the same techniques and after their defeat at the hands of black canary she hunted them down and killed them for dishonoring their father s name now calling herself white canary she traveled to gotham and set to blackmail black canary by revealing her secret identity and threatening to kill one teammate for each hour that passed enlisting the help of oswald cobblepot savant and creote 2 3 4 upon being defeated by black canary she denied being responsible for the death of a kidnapper in iceland to frame black canary claiming that it was in fact lady shiva and offers black canary help in killing shiva if she is set free later white canary takes black canary to bangkok and reveals that she is holding black canary s adopted daughter sin as a hostage and will kill her if black canary does not battle lady shiva in a duel to the death black canary agrees despite her broken wrist but at the last minute helena bertinelli challenges shiva in her place buying black canary enough time to find sin and get her to safety and lady shiva agrees to put their duel off until a later time white canary reluctantly concedes but promises that black canary has not seen the last of her 5 powers and abilities edit each of the twelve brothers in silk is considered almost lady shiva level in skill given that they fight as a group this makes them one of the most feared forces in the criminal world they allow themselves no alcohol women or other vices except for fighting they value honor highly and black canary both exploited this and was careful to respect it they would do anything to avoid losing face but to dishonor them would mean making a powerful enemy for life although they fight side by side their greatest weakness is supposedly that they do not really care about

genus lynx are believed to have evolved from lynx issiodorensis which lived in europe and africa during the late pliocene to early pleistocene the pliocene felid felis rexroadensis from north america has been proposed as an even earlier ancestor however this was larger than any living species and is not currently classified as a true lynx 11 12 eurasian lynx eurasian lynx main article eurasian lynx of the four lynx species the eurasian lynx lynx lynx is the largest in size it is native to european central asian and siberian forests while its conservation status has been classified as least concern populations of eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from much of europe where it is now being reintroduced during the summer the eurasian lynx has a relatively short reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much thicker silver grey to greyish brown coat during winter the lynx hunts by stalking and jumping on its prey helped by the rugged forested country in which it resides a favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is roe deer it will feed however on whatever animal appears easiest as it is an opportunistic predator much like its cousins 11 canada lynx canada lynx main article canada lynx the canada lynx lynx canadensis or canadian lynx is a north american felid that ranges in forest and tundra regions 13 across canada and into alaska as well as some parts of the northern united states historically the canadian lynx ranged from alaska across canada and into many of the northern u s states in the eastern states it resided in the transition zone in which boreal coniferous forests yielded to deciduous forests 14 by 2010 after an 11 year effort it had been successfully reintroduced into colorado where it had become extirpated in the 1970s 15 16 17 in 2000 the u s fish and wildlife service designated the canada lynx a threatened species in the lower 48 states 18 the canada lynx is a good climber and swimmer it constructs rough shelters under fallen trees or rock ledges it has a thick coat and broad paws and is twice as effective as the bobcat at supporting its weight on the snow the canada lynx feeds almost exclusively on snowshoe hares its population is highly dependent on the population of this prey animal it will also hunt medium sized mammals and birds if hare numbers fall 13 iberian lynx iberian lynx main article iberian lynx the iberian lynx lynx pardinus is an endangered species native to the iberian peninsula in southern europe it was the most endangered cat species in the world 19 but conservation efforts have changed its status from critical to endangered according to the portuguese conservation group sos lynx if this species dies out it will be the first feline extinction since the smilodon 10 000 years ago 20 the species used to be classified as a subspecies of the eurasian lynx but is now considered a separate species both species occurred together in central europe in the pleistocene epoch being separated by habitat choice 21 the iberian lynx is believed to have evolved from lynx issiodorensis 22 conservation efforts in 2004 a spanish government survey showed just two isolated breeding populations of iberian lynx in southern spain totaling about 100 lynx including only 25 breeding females 23 an agreement signed in 2003 by the spanish environment ministry and the andalusian environment council seeks to breed the iberian lynx in captivity 23 three iberian lynx cubs were born as part of the spanish program in 2005 at the centro el acebuche facility in doñana national park 23 as a result of the spanish government program and efforts by others such as the wwf and the eu s life projects the iberian lynx has recovered from the brink of extinction 24 from 2000 to 2015 the population of iberian lynx more than tripled 25 the iucn reassessed the species from critically endangered to endangered in 2015 24 a 2014 census of the species showed 327 animals in andalucia in the reintroduction

is a north american wild cat with 13 recognized subspecies the bobcat is common throughout southern canada the continental united states and northern mexico 26 like the eurasian lynx its conservation status is least concern 27 the bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits deciduous coniferous or mixed woodlands but unlike other lynx does not depend exclusively on the deep forest and ranges from swamps and desert lands to mountainous and agricultural areas its spotted coat serving as camouflage 28 the population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey 29 nonetheless the bobcat is often killed by larger predators such as coyotes 30 the bobcat resembles other species of the genus lynx but is on average the smallest of the four its coat is variable though generally tan to grayish brown with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail the ears are black tipped and pointed with short black tufts there is generally an off white color on the lips chin and underparts bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest colored coats while those in the northern forested regions have the darkest 10 behavior and diet the lynx is usually solitary although a small group of lynx may travel and hunt together occasionally mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between one and four kittens the gestation time of the lynx is about 70 days the young stay with the mother for one more winter a total of around nine months before moving out to live on their own as young adults the lynx creates its den in crevices or under ledges it feeds on a wide range of animals from white tailed deer reindeer roe deer small red deer and chamois to smaller more usual prey snowshoe hares fish foxes sheep squirrels mice turkeys and other birds and goats it also eats ptarmigans voles and grouse distribution and habitat a lynx stalking prey the lynx inhabits high altitude forests with dense cover of

risnjak national park in both countries the lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law the lynx was distributed throughout japan during jōmon period with no paleontological evidence

efforts to resettle the eurasian lynx in germany and since 2000 a small population can now be found in the harz mountains near bad lauterberg the lynx is found in the białowieża forest in northeastern poland in estonia and in the northern and western parts of china particularly the tibetan plateau in romania the numbers exceed 2 000 the largest population in europe outside of russia although most

swedish population is estimated to be 1200 1500 individuals spread all over the country but more common in middle sweden and in the mountain range the lynx population in finland was 1900 2100

1802 turtles are an order of reptiles known as testudines characterized by a shell developed mainly from their ribs modern turtles are divided into two major groups the pleurodira side necked turtles and cryptodira hidden necked turtles which differ in the way the head retracts there are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles including land dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins they are found on most continents some islands and in the case of sea turtles much of the ocean like other reptiles birds and mammals they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater although many species live in or around water turtle shells are made mostly of bone the upper part is the domed carapace while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly plate its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin the material of hair horns and claws the carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body turtles are ectotherms or cold blooded meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment they are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited movements many turtles migrate short distances seasonally sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world some terrestrial and freshwater species are widely kept as pets turtles have been hunted for their meat for use in traditional medicine and for their shells sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets turtle habitats around the world are being destroyed as a result of these pressures many species are threatened with extinction contents 1 naming

it is a common name and may be used without knowledge of taxonomic distinctions in north america it may denote the order as a whole in britain the name is used for sea turtles as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land dwelling tortoises in australia which lacks true tortoises family testudinidae non marine turtles were traditionally called tortoises but more recently turtle has been used for the entire group 5 the name of the order testudines tɛˈstjuːdɪniːz teh stew din eez is based on the latin word for tortoise testudo 6 and was coined by german naturalist august batsch in 1788 2 the order has also been historically known as chelonii latreille 1800 and chelonia ross and macartney 1802 3 which are based on the ancient greek word for tortoise χελώνη chelone 7 8 testudines is the official order name due to the principle of priority 3 the term chelonian is used as a formal name for members of the group 2 9 anatomy and physiology size the largest living species of turtle and fourth largest reptile is the leatherback turtle which can reach over 2 7 m 8 ft 10 in in length and weigh over 500 kg 1 100 lb 10 the largest known turtle was archelon ischyros a late cretaceous sea turtle up to 4 5 m 15 ft long 5 25 m 17 ft wide between the tips of the front flippers and estimated to have weighed over 2 200 kg 4 900 lb 11 the smallest living turtle is chersobius signatus of south africa measuring no more than 10 cm 3 9 in in length 12 and weighing 172 g 6 1 oz 13 shell main article turtle shell sagittal section of a tortoise skeleton the shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements 14 15 16 it is primarily made of 50 60 bones and consists of two parts the domed dorsal back carapace and the flatter ventral belly plastron they are connected by lateral side extensions of the plastron 14 17 the carapace is fused with the vertebrae and ribs while the plastron is formed from bones of the shoulder girdle sternum and gastralia abdominal ribs 14 during development the ribs grow sideways into a carapacial ridge unique to turtles entering the dermis inner skin of the back to support the carapace the development is signaled locally by proteins known as fibroblast growth factors that include fgf10 18 the shoulder girdle in turtles is made up of two bones the scapula and the coracoid 1 both the shoulder and pelvic girdles of turtles are located within the shell and hence are effectively within the rib cage the trunk ribs grow over the shoulder girdle during development 19 development of the shell the ribs are growing sideways into the carapacial ridge seen here as a bud to support the carapace 18 the shell is covered in epidermal outer skin scales known as scutes that are made of keratin the same substance that makes up hair and fingernails typically a turtle has 38 scutes on the carapace and 16 on the plastron giving them 54 in total carapace scutes are divided into marginals around the margin and vertebrals over the vertebral column though the scute that overlays the neck is called the cervical pleurals are present between the marginals and vertebrals 20 plastron scutes include gulars throat humerals pectorals abdominals and anals side necked turtles additionally have intergular scutes between the gulars 17 21 turtle scutes are usually structured like mosaic tiles but some species like the hawksbill sea turtle have overlapping scutes on the carapace 17 the shapes of turtle shells vary with the adaptations of the individual species and sometimes with sex land dwelling turtles are more dome shaped which appears to make them more resistant to being crushed by large animals aquatic turtles have flatter smoother shells that allow them to cut through the water sea turtles in particular have streamlined shells that reduce drag and increase stability in the open ocean some turtle species have pointy or spiked shells that provide extra protection from predators and camouflage against the leafy ground the lumps of a tortoise shell can tilt its body when it gets flipped over allowing it to flip back in male tortoises the tip of the plastron is thickened and used for butting and ramming during combat 22 shells vary in flexibility some species such as box turtles lack the lateral extensions and instead have the carapace bones fully fused or ankylosed together several species have hinges on their shells usually on the plastron which allow them to expand and contract softshell turtles have rubbery edges due to the loss of bones the leatherback turtle has hardly any bones in its shell but has thick connective tissue and an outer layer of leathery skin 23 head and neck head and neck of a european pond turtle the turtle s skull is unique among living amniotes which includes reptiles birds and mammals it is solid and rigid with no openings for muscle attachment temporal fenestrae 24 25 muscles instead attach to recesses in the back of the skull turtle skulls vary in shape from the long and narrow skulls of softshells to the broad and flattened skull of the mata mata 25 some turtle species have developed large and thick heads allowing for greater muscle mass and stronger bites 26 turtles that are carnivorous or durophagous eating hard shelled animals have the most powerful bites for example the durophagous mesoclemmys nasuta has a bite force of 432 lbf 1 920 n species that are insectivorous piscivorous fish eating or omnivorous have lower bite forces 27 living turtles lack teeth but have beaks made of keratin sheaths along the edges of the jaws 28 14 these sheaths may have sharp edges for cutting meat serrations for clipping plants or broad plates for breaking mollusks 29 the necks of turtles are highly flexible possibly to compensate for their rigid shells some species like sea turtles have short necks while others such as snake necked turtles have long ones despite this all turtle species have eight neck vertebrae a consistency not found in other reptiles but similar to mammals 30 some snake necked turtles have both long necks and large heads limiting their ability to lift them when not in water 26 some turtles have folded structures in the larynx or glottis that vibrate to produce sound other species have elastin rich vocal cords 31 32 limbs and locomotion due to their heavy shells turtles are slow moving on land a desert tortoise moves at only 0 22 0 48 km h 0 14 0 30 mph by contrast sea turtles can swim at 30 km h 19 mph 14 the limbs of turtles are adapted for various means of locomotion and habits and most have five toes tortoises are specialized for terrestrial environments and have column like legs with elephant like feet and short toes the gopher tortoise has flattened front limbs for digging in the substrate freshwater turtles have more flexible legs and longer toes with webbing giving them thrust in the water some of these species such as snapping turtles and mud turtles mainly walk along the water bottom as they would on land others such as terrapins swim by paddling with all four limbs switching between the opposing front and hind limbs which keeps their direction stable 14 33 sea turtles have streamlined shells and limbs adapted for fast and efficient swimming 34 sea turtles and the pig nosed turtle are the most specialized for swimming their front limbs have evolved into flippers while the shorter hind limbs are shaped more like rudders the front limbs provide most of the thrust for swimming while the hind limbs serve as stabilizers 14 35 sea turtles such as the green sea turtle rotate the front limb flippers like a bird s wings to generate a propulsive force on both the upstroke and on the downstroke this is in contrast to similar sized freshwater turtles measurements having been made on young animals in each case such as the caspian turtle which uses the front limbs like the oars of a rowing boat creating substantial negative thrust on the recovery stroke in each cycle in addition the streamlining of the marine turtles reduces drag as a result marine turtles produce a propulsive force twice as large and swim six times as fast as freshwater turtles the swimming efficiency of young marine turtles is similar to that of fast swimming fish of open water like mackerel 34 compared to other reptiles turtles tend to have reduced tails but these vary in both length and thickness among species and between sexes snapping turtles and the big headed turtle have longer tails the latter uses it for balance while climbing the cloaca is found underneath and at the base and the tail itself houses the reproductive organs hence males have longer tails to contain the penis in sea turtles the tail is longer and more prehensile in males who use it to grasp mates several turtle species have spines on their tails 36 24 senses the red eared slider has an exceptional seven types of color detecting cells in its eyes 37 turtles make use of vision to find food and mates avoid predators and orient themselves the retina s light sensitive cells include both rods for vision in low light and cones with three different photopigments for bright light where they have full color vision there is possibly a fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet as hatchling sea turtles respond experimentally to ultraviolet light but it is unknown if they can distinguish this from longer wavelengths a freshwater turtle the red eared slider has an exceptional seven types of cone cell 37 38 39 sea turtles orient themselves on land by night using visual features detected in dim light they can use their eyes in clear surface water muddy coasts the darkness of the deep ocean and also above water unlike in terrestrial turtles the cornea the curved surface that lets light into the eye does not help to focus light on the retina so focusing underwater is handled entirely by the lens behind the cornea the cone cells contain oil droplets placed to shift perception toward the red part of the spectrum improving color discrimination visual acuity studied in hatchlings is highest in a horizontal band with retinal cells packed about twice as densely as elsewhere this gives the best vision along the visual horizon sea turtles do not appear to use polarized light for orientation as many other animals do the deep diving leatherback turtle lacks specific adaptations to low light such as large eyes large lenses or a reflective tapetum it may rely on seeing the bioluminescence of prey when hunting in deep water 37 turtles have no ear openings the eardrum is covered with scales and encircled by a bony otic capsule which is absent in other reptiles 30 their hearing thresholds are high in comparison to other reptiles reaching up to 500 hz in air but underwater they are more attuned to lower frequencies 40 the loggerhead sea turtle has been shown experimentally to respond to low sounds with maximal sensitivity between 100 and 400 hz 41 turtles have olfactory smell and vomeronasal receptors along the nasal cavity the latter of which are used to detect chemical signals 42 experiments on green sea turtles showed they could learn to respond to a selection of different odorant chemicals such as triethylamine and cinnamaldehyde which were detected by olfaction in the nose such signals could be used in navigation 43 breathing a submerged indian softshell turtle nose breathing at river surface the rigid shell of turtles is not capable of expanding and making room for the lungs as in other amniotes so they have had to evolve special adaptations for respiration 44 45 46 the lungs of turtles are attached directly to the carapace above while below connective tissue attaches them to the organs 47 they have multiple lateral side and medial middle chambers the numbers of which vary between species and one terminal end chamber 48 the lungs are ventilated using specific groups of abdominal muscles attached to the organs that pull and push on them 44 specifically it is the turtle s large liver that compresses the lungs underneath the lungs in the coelomic cavity the liver is connected to the right lung by the root and the stomach is directly attached to the left lung and to the liver by a mesentery when the liver is pulled down inhalation begins 45 supporting the lungs is a wall or septum which is thought to prevent them from collapsing 49 during exhalation the contraction of the transversus abdominis muscle propels the organs into the lungs and expels air conversely during inhalation the relaxing and flattening of the oblique abdominis muscle pulls the transversus back down allowing air back into the lungs 45 although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater all turtles breathe air and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs depending on the species immersion periods vary between a minute and an hour 50 some species can respire through the cloaca which contains large sacs that are lined with many finger like projections that take up dissolved oxygen from the water 51 circulation snapping turtle emerging from period of brumation in which it buried itself in mud turtles have multiple circulatory and physiological adaptations to enable them to go long periods without breathing 52 turtles share the linked circulatory and pulmonary lung systems of vertebrates where the three chambered heart pumps deoxygenated blood through the lungs and then pumps the returned oxygenated blood through the body s tissues the cardiopulmonary system has both structural and physiological adaptations that distinguish it from other vertebrates turtles have a large lung volume and can move blood through non pulmonary blood vessels including some within the heart to avoid the lungs while they are not breathing they can hold their breath for much longer periods than other reptiles and they can tolerate the resulting low oxygen levels they can moderate the increase in acidity during anaerobic non oxygen based respiration by chemical buffering and they can lie dormant for months in aestivation or brumation 52 the heart has two atria but only one ventricle the ventricle is subdivided into three chambers a muscular ridge enables a complex pattern of blood flow so that the blood can be directed either to the lungs via the pulmonary artery or to the body via the aorta the ability to separate the two outflows varies between species the leatherback has a powerful muscular ridge enabling almost complete separation of the outflows supporting its actively swimming lifestyle the ridge is less well developed in freshwater turtles like the sliders trachemys 52 turtles are capable of enduring periods of anaerobic respiration longer than many other vertebrates this process breaks down sugars incompletely to lactic acid rather than all the way to carbon dioxide and water as in aerobic oxygen based respiration 52 they make use of the shell as a source of additional buffering agents for combating increased acidity and as a sink for lactic acid 53 osmoregulation in sea turtles the bladder is one unit and in most freshwater turtles it is double lobed 54 sea turtle bladders are connected to two small accessory bladders located at the sides to the neck of the urinary bladder and above the pubis 55 arid living tortoises have bladders that serve as reserves of water storing up to 20 of their body weight in fluids the fluids are normally low in solutes but higher during droughts when the reptile gains potassium salts from its plant diet the bladder stores these salts until the tortoise finds fresh drinking water 56 to regulate the amount of salt in their bodies sea turtles and diamondback terrapins secrete excess salt in a thick sticky substance from their tear glands because of this sea turtles may appear to be crying when on land 57 thermoregulation smaller pond turtles like these northern red bellied cooters regulate their temperature by basking in the sun turtles like other reptiles have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature this ability varies between species and with body size small pond turtles regulate their temperature by crawling out of the water and basking in the sun while small terrestrial turtles move between sunny and shady places to adjust their temperature large species both terrestrial and marine have sufficient mass to give them substantial thermal inertia meaning that they heat up or cool down over many hours the aldabra giant tortoise weighs up to some 60 kilograms 130 lb and is able to allow its temperature to rise to some 33 c 91 f on a hot day and to fall naturally to around 29 c 84 f by night some giant tortoises seek out shade to avoid overheating on sunny days on grand terre island food is scarce inland shade is scarce near the coast and the tortoises compete for space under the few trees on hot days large males may push smaller females out of the shade and some then overheat and die 58 adult sea turtles too have large enough bodies that they can to some extent control their temperature the largest turtle the leatherback can swim in the waters off nova scotia which may be as cold as 8 c 46 f while their body temperature has been measured at up to 12 c 54 f warmer than the surrounding water to help keep their temperature up they have a system of countercurrent heat exchange in the blood vessels between their body core and the skin of their flippers the vessels supplying the head are insulated by fat around the neck 58 behavior diet and feeding a green sea turtle grazing on seagrass most turtle species are opportunistic omnivores land dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous 26 generally lacking speed and agility most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with limited movements like mollusks worms and insect larvae 14 some species such as the african helmeted turtle and snapping turtles eat fish amphibians reptiles including other turtles birds and mammals they may take them by ambush but also scavenge 59 the alligator snapping turtle has a worm like appendage on its tongue that it uses to lure fish into its mouth tortoises are the most herbivorous group consuming grasses leaves and fruits 60 many turtle species including tortoises supplement their diet with eggshells animal bones hair and droppings for extra nutrients 61 turtles generally eat their food in a straightforward way though some species have special feeding techniques 14 the yellow spotted river turtle and the painted turtle may filter feed by skimming the water surface with their mouth and throat open to collect particles of food when the mouth closes the throat constricts and water is pushed out through the nostrils and the gap in between the jaws 62 some species employ a gape and suck method where the turtle opens its jaws and expands its throat widely sucking the prey in 14 63 64 the diet of an individual within a species may change with age sex and season and may also differ between populations in many species juveniles are generally carnivorous but become more herbivorous as adults 14 65 with barbour s map turtle the larger female mainly eats mollusks while the male usually eats arthropods 14 blanding s turtle may feed mainly on snails or crayfish depending on the population the european pond turtle has been recorded as being mostly carnivorous much of the year but switching to water lilies during the summer 66 some species have developed specialized diets such as the hawksbill which eats sponges the leatherback which feeds on jellyfish and the mekong snail eating turtle 26 14 communication and intelligence the oblong turtle has a sizable vocal repertoire 67 see also animal cognition while popularly thought of as mute turtles make various sounds to communicate 68 69 tortoises may bellow when courting and mating 69 30 various species of both freshwater and sea turtles emit short low frequency calls from the time they are in the egg to when they are adults these vocalizations may serve to create group cohesion when migrating 69 the oblong turtle has a particularly large vocal range producing sounds described as clacks clicks squawks hoots various kinds of chirps wails hooos grunts growls blow bursts howls and drum rolls 67 play behavior has been documented in some turtle species 70 in the laboratory florida red bellied cooters can learn novel tasks and have demonstrated a long term memory of at least 7 5 months 71 similarly giant tortoises can learn and remember tasks and master lessons much faster when trained in groups 72 tortoises appear to be able to retain operant conditioning nine years after their initial training 73 studies have shown that turtles can navigate the environment using landmarks and a map like system resulting in accurate direct routes towards a goal 74 navigation in turtles have been correlated to high cognition function in the medial cortex region of the brain 74 75 defense see also anti predator adaptation crested caracara eating a turtle when sensing danger a turtle may flee freeze or withdraw into its shell freshwater turtles flee into the water though the sonora mud turtle may take refuge on land as the shallow temporary ponds they inhabit make them vulnerable 76 when startled a softshell turtle may dive underwater and bury itself under the sea floor 77 if a predator persists the turtle may bite or discharge from its cloaca several species produce foul smelling chemicals from musk glands other tactics include threat displays and bell s hinge back tortoise can play dead when attacked big headed turtle hatchlings squeal possibly startling the predator 78 migration further information sea turtle migration turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances more specifically the marine species that can travel up to thousands of kilometers some non marine turtles such as the species of geochelone terrestrial chelydra freshwater and malaclemys estuarine migrate seasonally over much shorter distances up to around 27 km 17 mi to lay eggs such short migrations are comparable to those of some lizards snakes and crocodilians 79 sea turtles nest in a specific area such as a beach leaving the eggs to hatch unattended the young turtles leave that area migrating long distances in the years or decades in which they grow to maturity and then return seemingly to the same area every few years to mate and lay eggs though the precision varies between species and populations this natal homing has appeared remarkable to biologists though there is now plentiful evidence for it including from genetics 80 how sea turtles navigate to their breeding beaches remains unknown one possibility is imprinting as in salmon where the young learn the chemical signature effectively the scent of their home waters before leaving and remember that when the time comes for them to return as adults another possible cue is the orientation of the earth s magnetic field at the natal beach there is experimental evidence that turtles have an effective magnetic sense and that they use this in navigation proof that homing occurs is derived from genetic analysis of populations of loggerheads hawksbills leatherbacks and olive ridleys by nesting place for each of these species the populations in different places have their own mitochondrial dna genetic signatures that persist over the years this shows that the populations are distinct and that homing must be occurring reliably 80 reproduction and lifecycle desert tortoises fighting turtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors but do not form pair bonds or social groups 81 in green sea turtles females generally outnumber males 82 in terrestrial species males are often larger than females and fighting between males establishes a dominance hierarchy for access to mates for most semi aquatic and bottom walking aquatic species combat occurs less often males of these species instead may use their size advantage to mate forcibly in fully aquatic species males are often smaller than females and rely on courtship displays to gain mating access to females 83 courtship and mounting courtship varies between species and with habitat it is often complex in aquatic species both marine and freshwater but simpler in the semi aquatic mud turtles and snapping turtles a male tortoise bobs his head then subdues the female by biting and butting her before mounting 14 the male scorpion mud turtle approaches the female from the rear and often resorts to aggressive methods such as biting the female s tail or hind limbs followed by a mounting 84 female choice is important in some species and female green sea turtles are not always receptive as such they have evolved behaviors to avoid the male s attempts at copulation such as swimming away confronting the male followed by biting or taking up a refusal position with her body vertical her limbs widely outspread and her plastron facing the male if the water is too shallow for the refusal position the females resort to beaching themselves as the males do not follow them ashore 82 mounting behavior in the three toed box turtle all turtles fertilize internally mounting and copulation can be difficult in many species males have a concave plastron that interlocks with the female s carapace in species like the russian tortoise the male has a lighter shell and longer legs the high rounded shape of box turtles are particular obstacles for mounting the male eastern box turtle leans backward and hooks onto the back of the female s plastron 85 aquatic turtles mount in water 86 87 and female sea turtles support the mounting male while swimming and diving 88 during copulation the male turtle aligns his tail with the female s so he can insert his penis into her cloaca 89 some female turtles can store sperm from multiple males and their egg clutches can have multiple sires 90 81 eggs and hatchlings a female common snapping turtle depositing her eggs in a hole she dug turtles including sea turtles lay their eggs on land although some lay eggs close near water that rises and falls in level submerging the eggs while most species build nests and lay eggs where they forage some travel miles the common snapping turtle walks 5 km 3 mi on land while sea turtles travel even further the leatherback swims some 12 000 km 7 500 mi to its nesting beaches 14 87 most turtles create a nest for their eggs females usually dig a flask like chamber in the substrate other species lay their eggs in vegetation or crevices 91 females choose nesting locations based on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity which are important for developing embryos 87 depending on the species the number of eggs laid varies from one to over 100 larger females can lay eggs that are greater in number or bigger in size compared to freshwater turtles tortoises deposit fewer but larger eggs females can lay multiple clutches throughout a season particularly in species that experience unpredictable monsoons 92 marginated tortoise emerges from its egg most mother turtles do no more in the way of parental care than covering their eggs and immediately leaving though some species guard their nests for days or weeks 93 eggs vary between rounded oval elongated and between hard and soft shelled 94 most species have their sex determined by temperature in some species higher temperatures produce females and lower ones produce males while in others milder temperatures produce males and both hot and cold extremes produce females 14 there is experimental evidence that the embryos of mauremys reevesii can move around inside their eggs to select the best temperature for development thus influencing their sexual destiny 95 in other species sex is determined genetically the length of incubation for turtle eggs varies from two to three months for temperate species and four months to over a year for tropical species 14 species that live in warm temperate climates can delay their development 96 hatching young turtles break out of the shell using an egg tooth a sharp projection that exists temporarily on their upper beak 14 97 hatchlings dig themselves out of the nest and find safety in vegetation or water some species stay in the nest for longer be it for overwintering or to wait for the rain to loosen the soil for them to dig out 14 young turtles are highly vulnerable to predators both in the egg and as hatchlings mortality is high during this period but significantly decreases when they reach adulthood most species grow quickly during their early years and slow down when they are mature 98 lifespan turtles can live long lives the oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a seychelles giant tortoise named jonathan who turned 187 in 2019 99 a galápagos tortoise named harriet was collected by charles darwin in 1835 it died in 2006 having lived for at least 176 years most wild turtles do not reach that age turtles keep growing new scutes under the previous scutes every year allowing researchers to estimate how long they have lived 100 they also age slowly 101 the survival rate for adult turtles can reach 99 per year 14 systematics and evolution further information turtle classification and list of testudines families fossil history diagram of the origins of the turtle body plan through the triassic isolated bony plates evolved to form a complete shell in a sequence involving pappochelys eorhynchochelys odontochelys and proganochelys 19 zoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles and in particular of their unique shells in 1914 jan versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis called osteoderms fused to the ribs beneath them later called the polka dot ancestor by olivier rieppel 19 102 the theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from bradysaurus to anthodon but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates 19 more recent discoveries have painted a different scenario for the evolution of the turtle s shell the stem turtles eunotosaurus of the middle permian pappochelys of the middle triassic and eorhynchochelys of the late triassic lacked carapaces and plastrons but had shortened torsos expanded ribs and lengthened dorsal vertebrae also in the late triassic odontochelys had a partial shell consisting of a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace the development of a shell reached completion with the late triassic proganochelys with its fully developed carapace and plastron 19 103 adaptations that lead to the evolution of the shell may have originally been for digging and a fossorial lifestyle 103 the oldest known members of the pleurodira lineage are the platychelyidae from the late jurassic 104 the oldest known unambiguous cryptodire is sinaspideretes a close relative of softshell turtles from the late jurassic of china 105 during the late cretaceous and cenozoic members of the pleurodire families bothremydidae and podocnemididae became widely distributed in the northern hemisphere due to their coastal habits 106 107 the oldest known soft shelled turtles and sea turtles appeared during the early cretaceous 108 109 tortoises originated in asia during the eocene 110 a late surviving group of stem turtles the meiolaniidae survived in australasia into the pleistocene and holocene 111 external relationships the turtles exact ancestry has been disputed it was believed they were the only surviving branch of the ancient evolutionary grade anapsida which includes groups such as procolophonids and pareiasaurs all anapsid skulls lack a temporal opening while all other living amniotes have temporal openings 112 it was later suggested that the anapsid like turtle skulls may be due to backward evolution rather than to anapsid descent 113 fossil evidence has shown that early stem turtles possessed small temporal openings 103 some early morphological phylogenetic studies have placed turtles closer to lepidosauria tuataras lizards and snakes than to archosauria crocodilians and birds 112 by contrast several molecular studies place turtles either within archosauria 114 or more commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs 113 115 116 117 though an analysis conducted by tyler lyson and colleagues 2012 recovered turtles as the sister group of lepidosaurs instead 118 ylenia chiari and colleagues 2012 analyzed 248 nuclear genes from 16 vertebrates and suggested that turtles share a more recent common ancestor with birds and crocodilians the date of separation of turtles and birds and crocodilians was estimated to be 255 million years ago during the permian 119 through genomic scale phylogenetic study of ultra conserved elements uces to clarify the placement of turtles within reptiles nicholas crawford and colleagues 2012 similarly found that turtles are closer to birds and crocodilians 120 using the draft unfinished genome sequences of the green sea turtle and the chinese softshell turtle zhuo wang and colleagues 2013 concluded that turtles are likely a sister group of crocodilians and birds 121 the external phylogeny of the turtles is shown in the cladogram below 120 diapsida archosauromorpha crocodilia crocodiles alligators aves birds testudines lepidosauromorpha squamata lizards snakes internal relationships modern turtles and their extinct relatives with a complete shell are classified within the clade testudinata 122 the most recent common ancestor of living turtles corresponding to the split between pleurodira side necked species and cryptodira hidden necked species is estimated to have occurred around 210 million years ago during the late triassic 123 robert thompson and colleagues 2021 comment that living turtles have low diversity relative to how long they existed diversity has been stable according to their analysis except for a single rapid increase around the eocene oligocene boundary some 30 million years ago and a large regional extinction at roughly the same time they suggest that global climate change caused both events as the cooling and drying caused the land to become arid and turtles to become extinct there while new continental margins opened up by the climate change provided habitats for other species to evolve 124 the cladogram from nicholas crawford and colleagues 2015 shows the internal phylogeny of the testudines down to the level of families 125 126 the analysis by thompson and colleagues in 2021 supports the same structure down to the family level 124 testudines pleurodira pelomedusidae podocnemididae chelidae side necked turtles cryptodira testudinoidea testudinidae tortoises geoemydidae platysternidae emydidae terrapins chelydroidea chelydridae snapping turtles dermatemydidae kinosternidae chelonioidea dermochelyidae leatherback cheloniidae sea turtles hardshell turtles trionychia carettochelyidae pig nosed turtle trionychidae softshell turtles hidden necked turtles differences between the two suborders neck retractioncryptodira retract their necks backward pleurodira retract their necks sideways the different mechanisms of neck retraction in the two suborders of turtles turtles are divided into two living suborders cryptodira and pleurodira 127 the two groups differ in the way the neck is retracted for protection pleurodirans retract their neck to the side and in front of the shoulder girdles whereas cryptodirans retract their neck backward into their shell these motions are enabled by the morphology and arrangement of neck vertebrae 128 129 sea turtles which belong to cryptodira have mostly lost the ability to retract their heads 130 the adductor muscles in the lower jaw create a pulley like system in both subgroups however the bones that the muscles articulate with differ in pleurodira the pulley is formed with the pterygoid bones of the palate but in cryptodira the pulley is formed with the otic capsule both systems help to vertically redirect the adductor muscles and maintain a powerful bite 131 a further difference between the suborders is the attachment of the pelvis in cryptodira the pelvis is free linked to the shell only by ligaments in pleurodira the pelvis is sutured joined with bony connections to the carapace and to the plastron creating a pair of large columns of bone at the back end of the turtle linking the two parts of the shell 132 distribution and habitat turtles are widely distributed across the world s continents oceans and islands with terrestrial fully aquatic and semi aquatic species sea turtles are mainly tropical and subtropical but leatherbacks can be found in colder areas of the atlantic and pacific 133 living pleurodira all live in freshwater and are found only in the southern hemisphere 134 the cryptodira include terrestrial freshwater and marine species and these range more widely 133 the world regions richest in non marine turtle species are the amazon basin the gulf of mexico drainages of the united states and parts of south and southeast asia 135 for turtles in colder climates their distribution is limited by constraints on reproduction which is reduced by long hibernations north american species barely range above the southern canadian border 136 some turtles are found at high altitudes for example the species terrapene ornata occurs up to 2 000 m 6 600 ft in new mexico 137 conversely the leatherback sea turtle can dive over 1 200 m 3 900 ft 138 species of the genus gopherus can tolerate both below freezing and over 40 c 104 f in body temperature though they are most active at 26 34 c 79 93 f 139 conservation many turtles have been killed accidentally in fishing nets 140 some trawlers now use nets fitted with turtle excluders 141 seen here a loggerhead escapes a net so fitted among vertebrate orders turtles are second only to primates in the percentage of threatened species 360 modern species have existed since 1500 ad of these 51 56 are considered threatened and 60 considered threatened or extinct 142 turtles face many threats including habitat destruction harvesting for consumption the pet trade 143 144 light pollution 145 and climate change 146 asian species have a particularly high extinction risk primarily due to their long term unsustainable exploitation for food and medicine 147 and about 83 of asia s non marine turtle species are considered threatened 142 as of 2021 turtle extinction is progressing much faster than during the cretaceous tertiary extinction at this rate all turtles could be extinct in a few centuries 148 turtle hatcheries can be set up when protection against flooding erosion predation or heavy poaching is required 149 150 151 chinese markets have sought to satisfy an increasing demand for turtle meat with farmed turtles in 2007 it was estimated that over a thousand turtle farms operated in china 152 all the same wild turtles continue to be caught and sent to market in large numbers resulting in what conservationists have called the asian turtle crisis 153 147 in the words of the biologist george amato the hunting of turtles vacuumed up entire species from areas in southeast asia even as biologists still did not know how many species lived in the region 154 in 2000 all the asian box turtles were placed on the cites list of endangered species 147 harvesting wild turtles is legal in some american states 155 and there has been a growing demand for american turtles in china 156 157 the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission estimated in 2008 that around 3 000 pounds of softshell turtles were exported weekly via tampa international airport 157 however the great majority of turtles exported from the us between 2002 and 2005 were farmed 156 large numbers of sea turtles are accidentally killed in longlines gillnets and trawling nets as bycatch a 2010 study suggested that over 8 million had been killed between 1990 and 2008 the eastern pacific and the mediterranean were identified as among the areas worst affected 140 since the 1980s the united states has required all shrimp trawlers to fit their nets with turtle excluder devices that prevent turtles from being entangled in the net and drowning 141 more locally other human activities are affecting marine turtles in australia queensland s shark culling program which uses shark nets and drum lines has killed over 5 000 turtles as bycatch between 1962 and 2015 including 719 loggerhead turtles and 33 hawksbill sea turtles which are listed as critically endangered 158 native turtle populations can also be threatened by invasive ones the central north american red eared slider turtle has been listed among the world s worst invasive species pet turtle having been released globally they appear to compete with native turtle species in

century turtles have featured in human cultures across the world since ancient times they are generally viewed positively despite not being cuddly or flashy their association with the ancient times and old age have contributed to their endearing image 161 in hindu mythology the world turtle named kurma or kacchapa supports four elephants on his back they in turn carry the weight of the whole world on their backs 162 163 the turtle is one of the ten avatars or incarnations of the god vishnu 162 the yoga pose kurmasana is named for the avatar 164 165 world turtles are found in native american cultures including the algonquian iroquois and lenape they tell many versions of the creation story of turtle island one version has muskrat pile up earth on turtle s back creating the continent of north america an iroquois version has the pregnant sky woman fall through a hole in the sky between a tree s roots where she is caught by birds who land her safely on turtle s back the earth grows around her the turtle here is altruistic but the world is a heavy burden and the turtle sometimes shakes itself to relieve the load causing earthquakes 162 166 167 a turtle was the symbol of the ancient mesopotamian god enki from the 3rd millennium bce onward 168 an ancient greek origin myth told that only the tortoise refused the invitation of the gods zeus and hera to their wedding as it preferred to stay at home zeus then ordered it to carry its house with it ever after 169 another of their gods hermes invented a seven stringed lyre made with the shell of a tortoise 170 in the shang dynasty chinese practice of plastromancy dating back to 1200 bce oracles were obtained by inscribing questions on turtle plastrons using the oldest known form of chinese characters burning the plastron and interpreting the resulting cracks later the turtle was one of the four sacred animals in confucianism while in the han period steles were mounted on top of stone turtles later linked with

pets some turtles particularly small terrestrial and freshwater species are kept as pets 182 183 the demand for pet turtles increased in the 1950s with the us being the main supplier particularly of farm bred red eared sliders the popularity for exotic pets has led to an increase in illegal wildlife trafficking around 21 of the value of live animal trade is in reptiles and turtles are among the more popularly traded species 184 poor husbandry of tortoises can cause chronic rhinitis nasal swelling overgrown beaks hyperparathyroidism which softens their skeleton constipation various reproductive problems and injuries from dogs 182 in the early 20th century people in the united states have organized and gambled on turtle races 185 as food and other uses the flesh of captured wild

glue explosive tipped grappling hook flash grenade tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations at the time of his debut green arrow functioned in many ways as an archery themed analogue of the very popular character batman green arrow enjoyed moderate success in his early years becoming the cover feature of more fun as well as having occasional appearances in other comics throughout his first twenty five years however the character never enjoyed greater popularity in the late 1960s writer denny o neil inspired by the character s dramatic visual redesign by neal adams chose to have him lose his fortune giving him the then unique role of a streetwise crusader for the working class and the disadvantaged in 1970 he was paired with a more law and order oriented hero green lantern in a ground breaking socially conscious comic book series 3 since then he has been popular among comic book fans and most writers have taken an urban gritty approach to the character the character was killed off in the 1990s and replaced by a new character oliver s son connor hawke connor however proved a less popular character and the original oliver queen character was resurrected in the 2001 quiver storyline by writer kevin smith in the 2000s the character has been featured in bigger storylines focusing on green arrow and black canary such as the dc event the green arrow black canary wedding and the high profile justice league cry for justice storyline prior to the character s relaunch alongside most of dc s properties in 2011 green arrow was not initially a well known character outside of comic book fandom he had appeared in a single episode of the animated series super friends in 1973 in the 2000s the character appeared in a number of dc television

green arrow and speedy s debut and their original costumes art by george papp green arrow and speedy first appeared in more fun comics 73 cover dated november 1941 which was illustrated by artist george papp when mort weisinger was creating the character aside from the obvious allusions to robin hood he took inspiration from a movie serial the green archer based on the novel by edgar wallace he retooled the concept into a superhero archer with obvious batman influences 4 these include green arrow s sidekick speedy his use of an arrowcar and arrow plane for transportation his use of an arrow cave as his headquarters his alter ego as a wealthy playboy the use of an arrow signal to summon him as well as a clown like arch foe named bull s eye similar to batman s arch foe the joker his and speedy s first origin stories were told in more fun comics 89 green arrow began as a back up feature in more fun comics but within four months the green arrow and speedy replaced doctor fate and the spectre as the cover feature in superhero comics of the golden age mike benton writes that their front cover star status was probably due to speedy s appeal teenage sidekicks were the current rage

smallville main articles smallville and justice league smallville justin hartley portrayed oliver queen green arrow in smallville and is first introduced in the season six episode sneeze dc comics writer mark waid had particular praise for hartley s performance stating i think justin hartley nails green arrow perfectly i mean there s that brashness that cockiness but not to the point where you want to smack him but right up to the edge 48 geoff johns former president and cco of dc entertainment and who wrote for hartley in the episode absolute justice concurred saying i love justin as green arrow i didn t realize how good he was until i saw him on screen like i knew he was good but every line he delivered was perfect he can make any line sound good so i was pleasantly surprised by how much he stole the scenes 49 the character starts off as a recurring character who is already an established vigilante in his home of star city and is originally paired with lois lane in a romantic storyline after a rough start he becomes a trusted ally and friend of clark kent green arrow retains his many unique arrows and demonstrates expert archery skill along with skilled use of a crossbow with many trick arrows in the episode justice oliver teams up with clark to put an end to lex luthor s experimentation with supervillains by teaming up with other superheroes clark has met on his journeys forming a prototypical justice league oliver is seen again in season seven for the episode siren in which he continues his fight against luthorcorp and meets another superhero black canary whom he recruits for his justice league in a flashback sequence in the season seven episode veritas a young version of oliver queen can be seen being played by luke gair from season eight through season ten hartley is a series regular and is woven into the backstory of smallville through the queens business connections with the luthor teague and swann families oliver was a childhood friend and schoolmate and later a teenage bully of lex luthor in the season eight episode requiem oliver risks his friendship with clark by killing lex something which clark would never support over the course of the series oliver and clark become increasingly close friends and they establish themselves full time as superheroes working with other members of the justice league when required oliver later becomes romantically involved with clark s best friend lois s cousin chloe sullivan whom he ultimately marries in the series finale oliver serves as the best man at clark and lois wedding service and chloe is shown to have a son in the future who is implied to be oliver s smallville season eleven a comic book continuation of the show reveals he is oliver s son jonathan queen named after clark s adoptive father during the sixth season of smallville there was talk of spinning off justin hartley s portrayal of the character green arrow into his own series hartley however refused to entertain the idea feeling it was his duty to respect what smallville had accomplished in five seasons and not steal the spotlight because there was talk of a spin off after his two appearances according to hartley talking was as far as the spin off idea ever got 50 51 a spin off series in which oliver led the justice league made it into early development the series was to have been helmed by stephen s deknight who would later go on to be the showrunner for the first season of marvel s daredevil 52 arrowverse edit stephen amell as green arrow in the fifth season of the television series arrow main article oliver queen arrowverse see also arrowverse arrow tv series list of arrow episodes and list of arrow characters in january 2012 following smallville s conclusion the cw prepared a new series centered around the character green arrow andrew kreisberg greg berlanti and marc guggenheim were announced to be developing the series 53 a week later the series was ordered to pilot to be directed by david nutter who had previously directed the pilot for smallville 54 when developing the series producer marc guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to chart their own course their own destiny and avoid any direct connections to smallville thus rather than continuing on with hartley s incarnation of the character they opted to cast a new actor in the role and establish the series as its own separate continuity 55 at the end of the same month canadian actor stephen amell was cast in the titular role of oliver queen 56 the series titled simply arrow follows the story of former playboy billionaire turned vigilante oliver queen after he is rescued from a presumably deserted island where he was shipwrecked five years earlier it also features flashbacks to his time away 57 guggenheim described the show as more of a hero show than a superhero one wanting the show to be realistic and stated that much of the inspiration for the flashback sequences was drawn from green arrow year one 58 andrew kreisberg explained that we designed oliver as a character a little more tortured than the comic series green arrow 59 the series premiered in north america on october 10 2012 60 and was picked up for a full season later that month 61 the show went on to air for seven full seasons 62 with a shortened eighth and final season consisting of ten episodes concluding in january

august 1983 contents 1 fictional character biography 2 powers and abilities 3 other versions 4 in other media 5 references 6 external links fictional character biography edit baron bedlam is really baron frederick delamb bedlam is an anagram of his last name delamb s father formerly a minor government official in the kingdom of markovia was installed as a puppet ruler by the nazis during world war ii it was during this time that bedlam made advances to a young woman she became very distressed over this and smashed a bottle into his face bedlam gained a prominent scar from that incident and the woman was executed at the end of the war american forces helped the markov family reclaim the throne even though frederick managed to flee the country his father was hanged by the mob years later frederick delamb taking the name baron bedlam gains the support of the soviet army and the mysterious political manipulator bad samaritan bedlam murders king viktor and seizes the throne soviet and markovian forces battle leading to deaths on both sides the crown prince brion markov with the aid of the scientist dr jace gains superpowers for the express purpose of stopping this invasion with the aid of other superheroes a grouping under batman s leadership that would soon call themselves the outsiders they infiltrate the country but having heard of dr jace s work in metahuman research bedlam underwent a similar process prince markov did and gained similar earth shattering abilities in order to aid in the invasion of markovia and depose king gregor to take back the country 1 in the final confrontation between bedlam s forces and markovia s outmatched army the outsiders intervene turning the tide of the battle geo force apparently kills bedlam by dropping him into a raging mob bedlam survives this however and has returned many times to face the team 2 soon after the outsiders confront another aspect of bedlam s forces the super powered masters of disaster the two groups engage in a prolonged battle in the meantime the bad samaritan also discovers bedlam s plan to clone adolf hitler when it s revealed that he was indeed killed but cloned back to life in a similar process bedlam was not pleased at this and attacks his ally the clone project ultimately ends in failure the new hitler ends up being greatly distressed at what his father has done and has no wish to continue the madness 3 the hitler clone later commits suicide his body being found by the outsiders at one point in the outsiders 1987 special delamb s baron bedlam identity is usurped by the psycho pirate 4 powers and abilities edit baron bedlam is a superior fighter a ruthless tactician and he possesses unlimited financial resources he once underwent the same geo force enhancement process which bestowed brion markov his unique metahuman abilities though bedlam s were further along than the prince s given his ability to manipulate the earth long before brion could but because fredrick was not of the royal line in markovian principality bedlam s faulty powers shorted out in heated battle with the revived hero leaving him powerless once more 5 other versions edit the name baron bedlam has recently been taken by another dc supervillain formerly known as doctor bedlam in other media edit baron frederick delamb baron bedlam appears in young justice outsiders voiced by nolan north this version is the brother of markovia s queen and biological uncle of princes gregor and brion markov who runs a secret metahuman trafficking syndicate in markovia called bedlam additionally he has undergone metahuman experimentation which gave him a stone like body capable of withstanding lava and superboy s punches with no visible damage delamb orchestrates a coup by hiring a quraci speedster to murder the king and queen and then attempts to frame brion for his crimes however gregor easily sees through his uncle s lies and has him arrested after superboy defeats delamb delamb later escapes captivity and attempts to regain the throne but is killed by brion who was secretly manipulated by zviad baazovi into doing so references edit outsiders 1 outsiders 2 adventures of the outsiders 34 june 1986

genesis narrative sees the account of ishmael s life take place through chapters 16 17 21 and 25 birth edit in genesis 16 the birth of ishmael was planned by the patriarch abraham s first wife who at that time was known as sarai she and her husband abram abraham sought a way to have children in order to fulfill the abrahamic covenant that was established in genesis 15 sarai was 75 years old and had yet to bear a child she had the idea to offer her egyptian handmaiden hagar to her husband so that they could have a child by her abraham took hagar as his wife and conceived a child with her 7 hagar began to show contempt for sarah who responded by treating her harshly hagar then fled into the desert region between abraham s settlement and shur genesis 16 7 16 describes the naming of ishmael and god s promise to hagar concerning ishmael and his descendants this occurred at the well of beer lahai roi where hagar encountered the angel of the lord who said to her behold you are with child and shall bear a son you shall call him ishmael for the lord has paid heed to your suffering 8 the angel commanded hagar return to your mistress sarai and submit to her abraham was blessed so that his descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth god would make of ishmael a great nation because he was of the seed of abraham however god told hagar that her son would be living in

exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation genesis 17 god also mentioned that he will be a wild donkey of a man his hand will be over against everyone and everyone s hand will be against him and he will live in the presence of his brethren genesis 16 a year later ishmael s half brother isaac was born to abraham by his first wife sarah when she was 90 years old genesis 17 17 after she had ceased showing any signs of fertility genesis 18 11 on the day of feasting during which abraham celebrated the weaning of isaac ishmael was mocking or playing with isaac the hebrew word מ צ ח ק meṣaḥeq is ambiguous 9 and sarah asked abraham to expel ishmael and his mother saying get rid of that slave woman and her son for that slave woman s son will never share in the inheritance with my son isaac 10 11 her demand was painful for abraham who loved ishmael abraham agreed only after god told him that in isaac your seed shall be called and that god would make a nation

kedemah esauadah aholibamah mahalath basemath reueljeushjaalamkoraheliphaz world views edit historians and academics in the field of source criticism believe that the stories of ishmael belong to the three strata of j or yahwist source the p or priestly source and the e or elohist source see documentary hypothesis 6 for example the narration in genesis 16 is of j type and the narration in genesis 21 8 21 is of e type 19 genesis 25 would have been added during the persian period by the priestly source who attributed the known ishmaelite shumu ilu tribes as the names of the sons of ishmael although the narrative and name of ishmael himself preceded this 20 jewish and islamic traditions consider ishmael to be the ancestor of arabians 21 pre islamic arabia edit some pre islamic poetry mentions ishmael his father abraham and a sacrifice story such as the pre islamic poet umayyah ibn abi as salt who said in one of his poems بكره لم يكن ليصبر عنه أو يراه في معشر أقتال the sacrifice of his first born of whose separation he abraham could not bear neither could he see him surrounded in foes 22 23 24 zayd ibn amr was another pre islamic figure who refused idolatry and preached monotheism claiming it was the original belief of their arabs father ishmael 25 26 also some of the tribes of central west arabia called themselves the people of abraham and the offspring of ishmael as evidenced by a common opening of speeches and harangues of reconciliation between rival tribes in that area 27 28 judaism edit see also isaac in jewish traditions in judaism ishmael was inclined towards many things abraham considered wicked ishmael even prayed to idols when he believed himself unobserved 29 although this narrative is not in the torah according to the book of genesis in the hebrew bible isaac rather than ishmael was the true heir of the abrahamic tradition and covenant while at the same time being blessed by god with a great nation 30 in samaritan torah version ishmael was described in book of genesis 16 as a fertile of man instead of a wild ass of a man as suggested in masoretic pentateuch which commonly used as standard version of hebrew bible in jewish community 31 in some traditions ishmael is said to have had two wives one of them named aisha 32 33 this name corresponds to the muslim tradition for the name of muhammad s wife 5 this is understood as a metaphoric representation of the muslim world first arabs and then turks with ishmael 34 35 rabbinical commentators in the midrash genesis rabbah also say that ishmael s mother hagar was the pharaoh s daughter making ishmael the pharaoh s grandson this could be why genesis 17 20 refers to ishmael as the father of 12 mighty princes according to genesis 21 21 hagar married ishmael to an egyptian woman and if rabbinical commentators are correct that hagar was the pharaoh s daughter his marriage to a woman she selected could explain how and why his sons became princes according to other jewish commentators ishmael s mother hagar is identified with keturah the woman abraham sought out and married after sarah s death it is suggested that keturah was hagar s personal name and that hagar was a descriptive label meaning stranger 36 37 38 this interpretation is discussed in the midrash 39 and is supported by rashi gur aryeh keli yakar and obadiah of bertinoro rashi rabbi shlomo itzhaki argues that keturah was a name given to hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense hebrew ketoret and that she remained chaste literally tied her opening with the verb tied in aramaic being k t r from the time she was separated from abraham it is also said that sarah was motivated by ishmael s sexually frivolous ways because of the reference to his making merry gen 21 9 a translation of the hebrew word mitzachek this was developed into a reference to idolatry sexual immorality or even murder some rabbinic sources claim that sarah worried that ishmael would negatively influence isaac or that he would demand isaac s inheritance on the grounds of being the firstborn regarding the word mitzachek again in gen 21 9 the jewish study bible by oxford university press says this word in this particular context is associated with playing is another pun on isaac s name cf 17 17 18 12 19 14 26 8 ishmael was isaacing or taking isaac s place 40 others take a more positive view emphasizing hagar s piety noting that she was the one who had sat by the well and besought him who is the life of the worlds saying look upon my misery 41 christianity edit see also hagar in christian tradition and isaac in the new testament in the book of galatians 4 21 31 paul uses the incident to symbolize the two covenants the old but fulfilled and new covenant which is universal by promise through jesus christ 5 in galatians 4 28 31 42 hagar is associated with the sinai covenant while sarah is associated with the covenant of grace into which her son isaac enters 43 some christians believe that god fulfills his promises to ishmael today by blessing the ishmaelites with oil 44 and political strength 45 islam edit see also ishmael in islam ishmael arabic إسماعيل ismāʿēl is recognized as an

kifl as one of the patiently enduring and righteous whom god caused to enter into his mercy 49 it is also said of lot elisha jonah and ishmael that god gave each one preference above the worlds 50 these references to ishmael are in each case part of a larger context in which other holy prophets are mentioned in other chapters of the quran however which date from the medina period ishmael is mentioned closely with his father abraham ishmael stands alongside abraham in their attempt to set up the kaaba in mecca as a place of monotheistic pilgrimage 51 and abraham thanks god for granting him ishmael and isaac in his old age 52 ishmael is further mentioned alongside the patriarchs who had been given revelations 53 and jacob s sons promised to follow the faith of their forefathers abraham ishmael and isaac when testifying their faith 54 in the quranic narrative of the near sacrifice of abraham s son 55 the son is not named and although the general interpretation is that it was ishmael tabari 56 maintained that it was isaac consistent with the hebrew scriptures most modern commentators however regard the son s identification as least important in a narrative given for its moral lesson 57 ishmael in muslim literature edit abraham sacrificing his son ishmael and abraham cast into fire by nimrod a miniature in the 16th century ottoman turkish manuscript zubdat al tawarikh the commentaries on the quran and the numerous collections of stories of the prophets flesh out the islamic perspective of ishmael and detail what they describe as his integral part in setting up the kaaba according to muslim tradition ishmael was buried at the hijr near the kaaba inside the sacred mosque 58 in islamic belief abraham prayed to god for a son and god heard his prayer muslim exegesis states that sarah asked abraham to marry her egyptian handmaiden hagar because she herself was barren 1 hagar soon bore ishmael who was the first son of abraham god then instructed abraham to take hagar and ishmael to the desert and leave them there he did so taking them to the location of the kaaba s foundations which now was in ruins and as he turned away from hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked why are you leaving us here to which abraham didn t reply the first two times she asked she then changed her question and asked did god command you to do this to which abraham stopped turned around looked back and replied yes she responded then god will provide for us abraham then continued on his journey back to sarah in the desert the baby ishmael cried with thirst 1 his mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went on a frantic search for water which resulted in her running seven times between the safa and marwah hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan she could trade with for water hagar not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby sat down and cried asking for god s help god sent angel gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water forming the zamzam well hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink this spring became known to caravans that traveled through arabia and hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water from her actions the city of mecca originally becca or baca in hebrew grew and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans to commemorate the blessing of the zamzam well god gave to hagar and ishmael muslims run between the safa and marwah hills retracing hagar s steps during the rites of hajj 1 abraham returned and visited ishmael at various times throughout his life at one time according to a tradition of muhammad abraham had arrived when his son was out and abraham visited with ishmael s wife abraham decided to leave before seeing his son but based upon the complaints ishmael s wife made in response to his questions he gave her a message to give to her husband when he returned home which was change his threshold when ishmael arrived that night he asked if they had had any visitors and was informed by his wife of the man who had visited and what he said ishmael understood his father and explained to his wife that the visitor was his father and he had been instructed to divorce his wife and find a better one which ishmael did some time after this abraham returned to visit ishmael and again ishmael was out abraham talked with ishmael s new wife and found her answers indicated faith in god and contentment with her husband abraham again had to leave before he saw his son but left him the message to keep his threshold when ishmael returned that night he again asked if there had been any visitors and was informed of abraham s visit ishmael told his wife who it was that had come to visit and that he approved of her and their marriage on one of his visits to mecca abraham is said to have asked his son to help him build the requested kaaba 59 islamic traditions hold that the kaaba was first built by adam and that abraham and ishmael rebuilt the kaaba on the old foundations 60 as ishmael grew up in arabia he is said to have become fluent in arabic in the genealogical trees that the early scholars drew 61 ishmael was considered the ancestor of the northern arabs and muhammad was linked to him through the lineage of the patriarch adnan bahá í faith edit the scriptures of the baháʼí faith state that it was ishmael and not isaac who was the son abraham almost sacrificed 62 but they also state that the name is unimportant as either could be used the importance is that both were symbols of sacrifice 63 according to shoghi effendi there has also been

the full extent of his power to knock geode unconscious later geode is free from her captivity thanks to an unusual character named veritas veritas wants geode to begin markovia s immediate

supposed doom and geo force finally realizes that veritas used geode to tempt geo force into unleashing his untapped abilities in order to destroy markovia now markovia is torn between civil war and the devastation that brion has inadvertently wrought on his people dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form

scorching lava blasts in imitation of terrestrial volcanoes 13 by using his null gravity power on himself coupled with lava blasts for propulsion geo force can fly at great speeds for short periods of time his teammate black lightning once remarked that geo force weakens after flying 1 000 miles geo force has demonstrated the ability to manipulate the earth itself in a manner similar to terra brion has shown he can turn organic material to earthen mineral with a touch this ability is not quite explained in the instance where he turns the reanimated corpse of terra to stone 14 geo force possesses impressive superhuman strength speed and durability he once used his gravity manipulation powers to enhance his own super strength strengthening him sufficiently enough to fight pre crisis superman toe to toe 15 when he is shot in the back by the clone of baron bedlam the bullets stagger him but they do not puncture his skin 16 brion has the addition of on again off again earth moving abilities similar to what tara markov possessed for some reason they seemed to fluctuate in continuity 17 having enough affinity with the geophysical to aid in keep the planet from splitting into pieces during the war of the gods 18 reportedly his geokinesis is so powerful that working in conjunction with four other similarly powered individuals geo force could crack the planet in half 19 with the return of these abilities however the level of durability he has seems to fluctuate at one time being slashed by sharp items usually a deep wound triggering this unstable and largely dormant facet of his powers

from beneath the earth s surface as well during convergence 22 brion markov has gained his powers due in part to his heritage as a prince of markovia as well as the effects of the device designed for

killed and buried by enemy soldiers the earth nurtured geo force healing his wounds and restoring him 24 through his connection to the earth geo force is able to survive indefinitely without food

meaning that they were formed from clay bearing earth or mud and dried usually in the sun until they were strong enough for use the oldest discovered bricks originally made from shaped mud and dating before 7500 bc were found at tell aswad in the upper tigris region and in southeast anatolia close to diyarbakir 3 mud brick construction was used at catal hüyük from c 7 400 bc 4 mud brick structures dating to c 7 200 bc have been dated in jericho jordan valley 5 the south asian inhabitants of mehrgarh also constructed air dried mudbrick structures between 7000 and 3300 bc 6 and later the ancient indus valley cities of mohenjo daro harappa 7 and mehrgarh 8 ceramic or fired brick was used as early as 3000 bc in early indus valley cities like kalibangan 9 the brickwork of shebeli tower in iran displays 12th century craftsmanship china the earliest fired bricks appeared in neolithic china around 4400 bc at chengtoushan a walled settlement of the daxi culture 10 these bricks were made of red clay fired on all sides to above 600 c and used as flooring for houses by the qujialing period 3300 bc fired bricks were being used to pave roads and as building foundations at chengtoushan 11 according to lukas nickel the use of ceramic pieces for protecting and decorating floors and walls dates back at various cultural sites to 3000 2000 bc and perhaps even before but these elements should be rather qualified as tiles for the longest time builders relied on wood mud and rammed earth while fired brick and mud brick played no structural role in architecture proper brick construction for erecting walls and vaults finally emerges in the 3rd century bc when baked bricks of regular shape began to be employed for vaulting underground tombs 12 the oldest extant brick building above ground is possibly songyue pagoda dated to 523 ad the carpenter s manual yingzao fashi published in 1103 at the time of the song dynasty described the brick making process and glazing techniques then in use using the 17th century encyclopaedic text tiangong kaiwu historian timothy brook outlined the brick production process of ming dynasty china the kilnmaster had to make sure that the temperature inside the kiln stayed at a level that caused the clay to shimmer with the colour of molten gold or silver he also had to know when to quench the kiln with water so as to produce the surface glaze to anonymous labourers fell the less skilled stages of brick production mixing clay and water driving oxen over the mixture to trample it into a thick paste scooping the paste into standardised wooden frames to produce a brick roughly 42 cm long 20 cm wide and 10 cm thick smoothing the surfaces with a wire strung bow removing them from the frames printing the fronts and backs with stamps that indicated where the bricks came from and who made them loading the kilns with fuel likelier wood than coal stacking the bricks in the kiln removing them to cool while the kilns were still hot and bundling them into pallets for transportation it was hot filthy work europe main article roman brick the roman basilica aula palatina in trier germany built with fired bricks in the 4th century as an audience hall for constantine i early civilisations around the mediterranean adopted the use of fired bricks including the ancient greeks and romans the roman legions operated mobile kilns 13 and built large brick structures throughout the roman empire stamping the bricks with the seal of the legion 14 during the early middle ages the use of bricks in construction became popular in northern europe after being introduced there from northern western italy an independent style of brick architecture known as brick gothic similar to gothic architecture flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks examples of this architectural style can be found in modern day denmark germany poland and kaliningrad former east prussia 15 malbork castle of the teutonic order in poland the largest brick castle in the world this style evolved into brick renaissance as the stylistic changes associated with the italian renaissance spread to northern europe leading to the adoption of renaissance elements into brick building a clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to baroque architecture in lübeck for example brick renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist statius von düren who was also active at schwerin schwerin castle and wismar fürstenhof citation needed long distance bulk transport of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure with the construction of canal roads and railways citation needed industrial era in the national museum of roman art in mérida spain designed by rafael moneo and built in the 1980s the coating of hard fired clay bricks forms a compression resistant element together with the fill of non reinforced concrete 16 production of bricks increased massively with the onset of the industrial revolution and the rise in factory building in england for reasons of speed and economy bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone even in areas where the stone was readily available it was at this time in london that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents 17 the transition from the traditional method of production known as hand moulding to a mechanised form of mass production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century possibly the first successful brick making machine was patented by henry clayton employed at the atlas works in middlesex england in 1855 and was capable of producing up to 25 000 bricks daily with minimal supervision 18 his mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the south eastern railway company for brick making at their factory near folkestone 19 the bradley craven ltd stiff plastic brickmaking machine was patented in 1853 apparently predating clayton bradley craven went on to be a dominant manufacturer of brickmaking machinery 20 predating both clayton and bradley craven ltd however was the brick making machine patented by richard a ver valen of haverstraw new york in 1852 21 at the end of the 19th century the hudson river region of new york state would become the world s largest brick manufacturing region with 130 brickyards lining the shores of the hudson river from mechanicsville to haverstraw and employing 8 000 people at its peak about 1 billion bricks were produced a year with many being sent to new york city for use in its construction industry 22 the demand for high office building construction at the turn of the 20th century led to a much greater use of cast and wrought iron and later steel and concrete the use of brick for skyscraper construction severely limited the size of the building the monadnock building built in 1896 in chicago required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys 23 following pioneering work in the 1950s at the swiss federal institute of technology and the building research establishment in watford uk the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable however the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium sized buildings as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high rise construction 24 bricks are often made of shale because it easily splits into thin layers citation needed methods of manufacture this section needs

main article mudbrick unfired bricks also known as mudbricks are made from a wet clay containing soil mixed with straw or similar binders they are air dried until ready for use fired brick raw bricks sun drying before being fired fired bricks are burned in a kiln which makes them durable modern fired clay bricks are formed in one of three processes soft mud dry press or extruded depending on the country either the extruded or soft mud method is the most common since they are the most economical normally bricks contain the following ingredients 25 silica sand 50 to 60 by weight alumina clay 20 to 30 by weight lime 2 to 5 by weight iron oxide 7 by weight magnesia less than 1 by weight shaping methods three main methods are used for shaping the raw materials into bricks to be fired molded bricks these bricks start with raw clay preferably in a mix with 25 30 sand to reduce shrinkage the clay is first ground and mixed with water to the desired consistency the clay is then pressed into steel moulds with a hydraulic press the shaped clay is then fired burned at 900 1 000 c 1 650 1 830 f to achieve strength dry pressed bricks the dry press method is similar to the soft mud moulded method but starts with a much thicker clay mix so it forms more accurate sharper edged bricks the greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive extruded bricks for extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10 15 water stiff extrusion or 20 25 water soft extrusion in a pugmill this mixture is forced through a die to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth this mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard dense bricks and suitable dies can produce perforations as well the introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed and hence the cost hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle and have different thermal properties from solid bricks the cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150 c 120 to 300 f before being fired the heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln kilns xhosa brickmaker at kiln near ngcobo in 2007 in many modern brickworks bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on conveyors rails or kiln cars which achieves a more consistent brick product the bricks often have lime ash and organic matter added which accelerates the burning process the other major kiln type is the bull s trench kiln btk based on a design developed by british engineer w bull in the late 19th century an oval or circular trench is dug 6 9 metres 20 30 ft wide 2 2 5 metres 6 ft 7 in 8 ft 2 in deep and 100 150 metres 330 490 ft in circumference a tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre half or more of the trench is filled with green unfired bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow the lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick in operation new green bricks along with roofing bricks are stacked at one end of the brick pile historically a stack of unfired bricks covered for protection from the weather was called a hack 26 cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations in the middle the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel coal wood oil debris and so on through access holes in the roof above the trench the advantage of the btk design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with clamp or scove kilns sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks heating the air then through the active burning zone the air continues through the green brick zone pre heating and drying the bricks and finally out the chimney where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system the reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost as with the rail process the btk process is continuous a half dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15 000 25 000 bricks a day unlike the rail process in the btk process the bricks do not move instead the locations at which the bricks are loaded fired and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench 27 influences on colour yellow london stocks at waterloo station the colour of fired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials the firing temperature and the atmosphere in the kiln for example pink bricks are the result of a high iron content white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content most bricks burn to various red hues as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red purple and then to brown or grey at around 1 300 c 2 370 f the names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour such as london stock brick and cambridgeshire white brick tinting may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry an impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by salt glazing in which salt is added during the burning process or by the use of a slip which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base chemically set bricks chemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave calcium silicate bricks swedish mexitegel is a sand lime or lime cement brick calcium silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks depending on their ingredients rather than being made with clay they are made with lime binding the silicate material the raw materials for calcium silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand quartz crushed flint or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral colourants the materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an autoclave for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening 28 the finished bricks are very accurate and uniform although the sharp arrises need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer the bricks can be made in a variety of colours white black buff and grey blues are common and pastel shades can be achieved this type of brick is common in sweden belarus russia and other post soviet countries especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s a version known as fly ash bricks manufactured using fly ash lime and gypsum known as the fal g process are common in south asia calcium silicate bricks are also manufactured in canada and the united states and meet the criteria set forth in astm c73 10 standard specification for calcium silicate brick sand lime brick concrete bricks main article concrete masonry unit a concrete brick making assembly line in guilinyang town hainan china this operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks approximately every 30 seconds bricks formed from concrete are usually termed as blocks or concrete masonry unit and are typically pale grey they are made from a dry small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an egglayer or static machine the finished blocks are cured rather than fired using low pressure steam concrete bricks and blocks are manufactured in a wide range of shapes sizes and face treatments a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks concrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate resisting portland cement or equivalent when made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls they are made to standards bs 6073 en 771 3 or astm c55 concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance 28 compressed earth

assorted countries with isometric projections and dimensions in millimetres for efficient handling and laying bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand leaving the other hand free for the trowel bricks are usually laid flat and as a result the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand normally about 100 mm 4 in in most cases the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint about 200 mm 8 in or slightly more this allows bricks to be laid bonded in a structure which increases stability and strength for an example see the illustration of bricks laid in english bond at the head of this article the wall is built using alternating courses of stretchers bricks laid longways and headers bricks laid crossways the headers tie the wall together over its width in fact this wall is built in a variation of english bond called english cross bond where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length in true english bond the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other a bigger brick makes for a thicker and thus more insulating wall historically this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates see for instance the slightly larger size of the russian brick in table below while a smaller brick was adequate and more economical in warmer regions a notable illustration of this correlation is the green gate in gdansk built in 1571 of imported dutch brick too small for the colder climate of gdansk it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence nowadays this is no longer an issue as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials the correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour surface texture density weight absorption and pore structure thermal characteristics

fairly constant from 1625 when the size was regulated by statute at 9 x 4 1 2 x 3 inches 29 but see brick tax but the depth has varied from about two inches 51 mm or smaller in earlier times to about 2 1 2 inches 64 mm more recently in the united kingdom the usual size of a modern brick from 1965 30 is 215 mm 102 5 mm 65 mm 8 1 2 in 4 in 2 1 2 in which with a nominal 10 millimetres 3 8 in mortar joint forms a unit size of 225 by 112 5 by 75 millimetres 9 in 4 1 2 in 3 in for a ratio of 6 3 2 in the united states modern standard bricks are specified for various uses 31 the most commonly used is the modular brick has the actual dimensions of 7 5 8 3 5 8 2 1 4 inches 194 92 57 mm with the standard 3 8 inch mortar joint this gives the nominal dimensions of 8 x 4 x 2 2 3 inches which eases the calculation of the number of bricks in a given wall 32 the 2 1 ratio of modular bricks means that when they turn corners a 1 2 running bond is formed without needing to cut the brick down or fill the gap with a cut brick and the height of modular bricks means that a soldier course matches the height of three modular running courses or one standard cmu course some brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for plastering and therefore not visible on the inside of the building where their inherent mechanical properties are more important than their visual ones 33 these bricks are usually slightly larger but not as large as blocks and offer the following advantages a slightly larger brick requires less mortar and handling fewer bricks which reduces cost their ribbed exterior aids plastering more complex interior cavities allow improved insulation while maintaining strength blocks have a much greater range of sizes standard co ordinating sizes in length and height in mm include 400 200 450 150 450 200 450 225 450 300 600 150 600 200 and 600 225 depths work size mm include 60 75 90 100 115 140 150 190 200 225 and 250 they are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks the density of solid clay bricks is around 2000 kg m3 this is reduced by frogging hollow bricks and so on but aerated autoclaved concrete even as a solid brick can have densities in the range of 450 850 kg m3 bricks may also be classified as solid less than 25 perforations by volume although the brick may be frogged having indentations on one of the longer faces perforated containing a pattern of small holes through the brick removing no more than 25 of the volume cellular containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20 of the volume but closed on one face or hollow containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25 of the brick s volume blocks may be solid cellular or hollow the term frog can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood the compressive strength of bricks produced in the united states ranges from about 7 to 103 mpa 1 000 to 15 000 lbf in2 varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put in england clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 mpa although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20 40 mpa uses bricked front street along the cane river in historic natchitoches louisiana in the united states bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century the introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements but they are still sometimes installed as a method of traffic calming or as a decorative surface in pedestrian precincts for example in the early 1900s most of the streets in the city of grand rapids michigan were paved with bricks today there are only about 20 blocks of brick paved streets remaining totalling less than 0 5 percent of all the streets in the city limits 34 much like in grand rapids municipalities across the united states began replacing brick streets with inexpensive asphalt concrete by the mid 20th century 35 bricks in the metallurgy and glass industries are often used for lining furnaces in particular refractory bricks such as silica magnesia chamotte and neutral chromomagnesite refractory bricks this type of brick must have good thermal shock resistance refractoriness under load high melting point and satisfactory porosity there is a large refractory brick industry especially in the united kingdom japan the united states belgium and the netherlands in northwest europe bricks have been used in construction for centuries until recently almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks although many houses are now built using a mixture of concrete blocks and other materials many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal engineering bricks are used where strength low water porosity or acid flue gas resistance are needed in the uk a red brick university is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century the term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older oxbridge institutions and refers to the use of bricks as opposed to stone in their buildings colombian architect rogelio salmona was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals radial geometry and curves in his designs 36 most buildings in colombia are made of brick given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one limitations starting in the 20th century the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns about earthquakes earthquakes such as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and the 1933 long beach earthquake revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake prone areas during seismic events the mortar cracks and crumbles so that the bricks are no longer held together brick masonry with steel reinforcement which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes has been used to replace unreinforced bricks in many buildings retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions however similar to steel corrosion in reinforced concrete rebar rusting will compromise the structural integrity of reinforced brick and ultimately limit the expected lifetime so there is a trade off between earthquake safety and longevity to a certain extent a panorama after the 1906 san francisco

brilliant but genuinely unfriendly scientist administrator at s t a r labs with a rare nervous system disorder that short circuited the electrical impulses in his brain creating painful and uncontrollable seizures when he could not find a cure he secretly contacted the criminal organization skull and they implanted him with a radium powered device designed to harness his neural disorder into deadly atomic brain blasts in exchange for him becoming their agent 3 however these mental blasts were difficult to control and only made his condition worse a situation that he blamed on superman after the man of steel captured the only skull scientists who could have cured him swearing revenge the evil genius donned his distinctive yellow and green costume with its visored cowl topped skull mask called himself the atomic skull and eventually became the organization s leader flying around in a sleek skull shaped hovercraft of his own design and assisted by his similarly costumed lover felicia who was a panther that he had artificially evolved into human form following crisis on infinite earths michaels made one appearance battling thunder and lightning in teen titans spotlight it is assumed that his background has not changed although instead of being diagnosed with a nervous disorder it was said that his powers came because he sought immortality and presumably mutated himself it is not known if he ever fought the post crisis version of superman before as his first post crisis appearance was in captain atom yet his history with s t a r labs and skull

when superman had currently acquired electricity based powers and lois lane whom he saw as the skull s love interest zelda wentworth 6 he was later given enhanced powers by the demon neron in exchange for his soul 7 cured of his delusions he at first intended to follow the character s example for real as a superhero but has since appeared as a more conventional supervillain he is killed in battle

placed on her hands and feet to reduce harm to her nails other nameschemo ctx ctx edit on wikidata chemotherapy often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes ctx or ctx is a type of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti cancer drugs chemotherapeutic agents or alkylating agents as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent which almost always involves combinations of drugs or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms palliative chemotherapy chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer which is called medical oncology 1 2 the term chemotherapy has come to connote non specific usage of intracellular poisons to inhibit mitosis cell division or induce dna damage which is why inhibition of dna repair can augment chemotherapy 3 the connotation of the word chemotherapy excludes more selective agents that block extracellular signals signal transduction the development of therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets which inhibit growth promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer are now called hormonal therapies by contrast other inhibitions of growth signals like those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases are referred to as targeted therapy importantly the use of drugs whether chemotherapy hormonal therapy or targeted therapy constitutes systemic therapy for cancer in that they are introduced into the blood stream and are therefore in principle able to address cancer at any anatomic location in the body systemic therapy is often used in conjunction with other modalities that constitute local therapy i e treatments whose efficacy is confined to the anatomic area where they are applied for cancer such as radiation therapy surgery or hyperthermia therapy traditional chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by means of interfering with cell division mitosis but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents to a large extent chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti mitotic drugs cells in the bone marrow digestive tract and hair follicles this results in the most common side effects of chemotherapy myelosuppression decreased production of blood cells hence also immunosuppression mucositis inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract and alopecia hair loss because of the effect on immune cells especially lymphocytes chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self so called autoimmunity these include rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis vasculitis and many others

strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent or it may aim to prolong life or to palliate symptoms induction chemotherapy is the first line treatment of cancer with a chemotherapeutic drug this type of chemotherapy is used for curative intent 1 6 55 59 combined modality chemotherapy is the use of drugs with other cancer treatments such as surgery radiation therapy or hyperthermia therapy consolidation chemotherapy is given after remission in order to prolong the overall disease free time and improve overall survival the drug that is administered is the same as the drug that achieved remission 6 55 59 intensification chemotherapy is identical to consolidation chemotherapy but a different drug than the induction chemotherapy is used 6 55 59 combination chemotherapy involves treating a person with a number of different drugs simultaneously the drugs differ in their mechanism and side effects the biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent also the drugs can often be used at lower doses reducing toxicity 6 55 59 7 17 18 5 neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given prior to a local treatment such as surgery and is designed to shrink the primary tumor 6 55 59 it is also given for cancers with a high risk of micrometastatic disease 8 42 adjuvant chemotherapy is given after a local treatment radiotherapy or surgery it can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present but there is risk of recurrence 6 55 59 it is also useful in killing any cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body these micrometastases can be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and can reduce relapse rates caused by these disseminated cells 9 maintenance chemotherapy is a repeated low dose treatment to prolong remission 5 6 55 59 salvage chemotherapy or palliative chemotherapy is given without curative intent but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy for these regimens in general a better toxicity profile is expected 6 55 59 all chemotherapy regimens require that the recipient be capable of undergoing the treatment performance status is often used as a measure to determine whether a person can receive chemotherapy or whether dose reduction is required because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment fractional kill repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor 10 current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity 11 efficiency edit the efficiency of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage the overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers such as some leukemias 12 13 to being ineffective such as in some brain tumors 14 to being needless in others like most non melanoma skin cancers 15 dosage edit dose response relationship of cell killing by chemotherapeutic drugs on normal and cancer cells at high doses the percentage of normal and cancer cells killed is very similar for this reason doses are chosen where anti tumour activity exceeds normal cell death 4 dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult if the dose is too low it will be ineffective against the tumor whereas at excessive doses the toxicity side effects will be intolerable to the person receiving it 4 the standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area bsa the bsa is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram using the recipient s weight and height rather than by direct measurement of body area this formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans 16 the study only included nine human subjects 17 when chemotherapy was introduced in the 1950s the bsa formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing for lack of a better option 18 19 the validity of this method in calculating uniform doses has been questioned because the formula only takes into account the individual s weight and height drug absorption and clearance are influenced by multiple factors including age sex metabolism disease state organ function drug to drug interactions genetics and obesity which have major impacts on the actual concentration of the drug in the person s bloodstream 18 20 21 as a result there is high variability in the systemic chemotherapy drug concentration in people dosed by bsa and this variability has been demonstrated to be more than ten fold for many drugs 17 22 in other words if two people receive the same dose of a given drug based on bsa the concentration of that drug in the bloodstream of one person may be 10 times higher or lower compared to that of the other person 22 this variability is typical with many chemotherapy drugs dosed by bsa and as shown below was demonstrated in a study of 14 common chemotherapy drugs 17 5 fu dose management results in significantly better response and survival rates versus bsa dosing 23 the result of this pharmacokinetic variability among people is that many people do not receive the right dose to achieve optimal treatment effectiveness with minimized toxic side effects some people are overdosed while others are underdosed 18 20 21 23 24 25 26 for example in a randomized clinical trial investigators found 85 of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with 5 fluorouracil 5 fu did not receive the optimal therapeutic dose when dosed by the bsa standard 68 were underdosed and 17 were overdosed 23 there has been controversy over the use of bsa to calculate chemotherapy doses for people who are obese 27 because of their higher bsa clinicians often arbitrarily reduce the dose prescribed by the bsa formula for fear of overdosing 27 in many cases this can result in sub optimal treatment 27 several clinical studies have demonstrated that when chemotherapy dosing is individualized to achieve optimal systemic drug exposure treatment outcomes are improved and toxic side effects are reduced 23 25 in the 5 fu clinical study cited above people whose dose was adjusted to achieve a pre determined target exposure realized an 84 improvement in treatment response rate and a six month improvement in overall survival os compared with those dosed by bsa 23 5 fu dose management avoids serious side effects experienced with bsa dosing 23 5 fu dose management in the folfox regimen increases treatment response significantly and improves survival by six months 25 in the same study investigators compared the incidence of common 5 fu associated grade 3 4 toxicities between the dose adjusted people and people dosed per bsa 23 the incidence of debilitating grades of diarrhea was reduced from 18 in the bsa dosed group to 4 in the dose adjusted group and serious hematologic side effects were eliminated 23 because of the reduced toxicity dose adjusted patients were able to be treated for longer periods of time 23 bsa dosed people were treated for a total of 680 months while people in the dose adjusted group were treated for a total of 791 months 23 completing the course of treatment is an important factor in achieving better treatment outcomes similar results were found in a study involving people with colorectal cancer who have been treated with the popular folfox regimen 25 the incidence of serious diarrhea was reduced from 12 in the bsa dosed group of patients to 1 7 in the dose adjusted group and the incidence of severe mucositis was reduced from 15 to 0 8 25 the folfox study also demonstrated an improvement in treatment outcomes 25 positive response increased from 46 in the bsa dosed group to 70 in the dose adjusted group median progression free survival pfs and overall survival os both improved by six months in the dose adjusted group 25 one approach that can help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing is to measure the drug levels in blood plasma over time and adjust dose according to a formula or algorithm to achieve optimal exposure with an established target exposure for optimized treatment effectiveness with minimized toxicities dosing can be personalized to achieve target exposure and optimal results for each person such an algorithm was used in the clinical trials cited above and resulted in significantly improved treatment outcomes citation needed oncologists are already individualizing dosing of some cancer drugs based on exposure carboplatin 28 4 and busulfan 29 30 dosing rely upon results from blood tests to calculate the optimal dose for each person simple blood tests are also available for dose optimization of methotrexate 31 5 fu paclitaxel and docetaxel 32 33 the serum albumin level immediately prior to chemotherapy administration is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in various cancer types 34 types edit two dna bases that are cross linked by a nitrogen mustard different nitrogen mustards will have different chemical groups r the nitrogen mustards most commonly alkylate the n7 nitrogen of guanine as shown here but other atoms can be alkylated 35 alkylating agents edit main article alkylating antineoplastic agent alkylating agents are the oldest group of chemotherapeutics in use today originally derived from mustard gas used in world war i there are now many types of alkylating agents in use 4 they are so named because of their ability to alkylate many molecules including proteins rna and dna this ability to bind covalently to dna via their alkyl group is the primary cause for their anti cancer effects 36 dna is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of dna intrastrand crosslink or may bind once to both strands interstrand crosslink if the cell tries to replicate crosslinked dna during cell division or tries to repair it the dna strands can break this leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis 35 37 alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle independent drugs for this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug 38 the subtypes of alkylating agents are the nitrogen mustards nitrosoureas tetrazines aziridines 39 cisplatins and derivatives and non classical alkylating agents nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine cyclophosphamide melphalan chlorambucil ifosfamide and busulfan nitrosoureas include n nitroso n methylurea mnu carmustine bcnu lomustine ccnu and semustine meccnu fotemustine and streptozotocin tetrazines include dacarbazine mitozolomide and temozolomide aziridines include thiotepa mytomycin and diaziquone azq cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin carboplatin and oxaliplatin 36 37 they impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino carboxyl sulfhydryl and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules 40 non classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine 36 37 antimetabolites edit deoxycytidine left and two anti metabolite drugs center and right gemcitabine and decitabine the drugs are very similar but they have subtle differences in their chemical structure main article antimetabolite anti metabolites are a group of molecules that impede dna and rna synthesis many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of dna and rna the building blocks are nucleotides a molecule comprising a nucleobase a sugar and a phosphate group the nucleobases are divided into purines guanine and adenine and pyrimidines cytosine thymine and uracil anti metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides a nucleotide without the phosphate group but have altered chemical groups 41 these drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for dna synthesis or becoming incorporated into dna or rna by inhibiting the enzymes involved in dna synthesis they prevent mitosis because the dna cannot duplicate itself also after misincorporation of the molecules into dna dna damage can occur and programmed cell death apoptosis is induced unlike alkylating agents anti metabolites are cell cycle dependent this means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle in this case s phase the dna synthesis phase for this reason at a certain dose the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses subtypes of the anti metabolites are the anti folates fluoropyrimidines deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines 36 41 the anti folates include methotrexate and pemetrexed methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase dhfr an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate when the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish these are required for thymidylate and purine production which are both essential for dna synthesis and cell division 6 55 59 7 11 pemetrexed is another anti metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production and therefore also inhibits dna synthesis it primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase but also has effects on dhfr aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase 42 the fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products 5 fluourouridine monophosphate fump and 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine 5 phosphate fdump fump becomes incorporated into rna and fdump inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase both of which lead to cell death 7 11 capecitabine is a prodrug of 5 fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug 43 the deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine gemcitabine decitabine azacitidine fludarabine nelarabine cladribine clofarabine and pentostatin the thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine 36 41 anti microtubule agents edit vinca alkaloids prevent the assembly of microtubules whereas taxanes prevent their disassembly both mechanisms cause defective mitosis anti microtubule agents are plant derived chemicals that block cell division by preventing microtubule function microtubules are an important cellular structure composed of two proteins α tubulin and β tubulin they are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division among other cellular functions 44 microtubules are dynamic structures which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly vinca alkaloids and taxanes are the two main groups of anti microtubule agents and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction their mechanisms of action are completely opposite vinca alkaloids prevent the assembly of microtubules whereas taxanes prevent their disassembly by doing so they prevent cancer cells from completing mitosis following this cell cycle arrest occurs which induces programmed cell death apoptosis 36 45 these drugs can also affect blood vessel growth an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise 45 vinca alkaloids are derived from the madagascar periwinkle catharanthus roseus 46 47 formerly known as vinca rosea they bind to specific sites on tubulin inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules the original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include vincristine and vinblastine 48 49 50 51 following the success of these drugs semi synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced vinorelbine used in the treatment of non small cell lung cancer 50 52 53 vindesine and vinflunine 45 these drugs are cell cycle specific they bind to the tubulin molecules in s phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for m phase 38 taxanes are natural and semi synthetic drugs the first drug of their class paclitaxel was originally extracted from taxus brevifolia the pacific yew now this drug and another in this class docetaxel are produced semi synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another yew tree taxus baccata citation needed podophyllotoxin is an antineoplastic lignan obtained primarily from the american mayapple podophyllum peltatum and himalayan mayapple sinopodophyllum hexandrum it has anti microtubule activity and its mechanism is similar to that of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin inhibiting microtubule formation podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action etoposide and teniposide 54 55 topoisomerase inhibitors edit topoisomerase i and ii inhibitors main article topoisomerase inhibitor topoisomerase inhibitors are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes topoisomerase i and topoisomerase ii when the dna double strand helix is unwound during dna replication or transcription for example the adjacent unopened dna winds tighter supercoils like opening the middle of a twisted rope the stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes they produce single or double strand breaks into dna reducing the tension in the dna strand this allows the normal unwinding of dna to occur during replication or transcription inhibition of topoisomerase i or ii interferes with both of these processes 56 57 two topoisomerase i inhibitors irinotecan and topotecan are semi synthetically derived from camptothecin which is obtained from the chinese ornamental tree camptotheca acuminata 38 drugs that target topoisomerase ii can be divided into two groups the topoisomerase ii poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to dna this prevents dna replication and transcription causes dna strand breaks and leads to programmed cell death apoptosis these agents include etoposide doxorubicin mitoxantrone and teniposide the second group catalytic inhibitors are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase ii and therefore prevent dna synthesis and translation because the dna cannot unwind properly this group includes novobiocin merbarone and aclarubicin which also have other significant mechanisms of action 58 cytotoxic antibiotics edit the cytotoxic antibiotics are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action the common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication is that they interrupt cell division the most important subgroup is the anthracyclines and the bleomycins other prominent examples include mitomycin c and actinomycin 59 among the anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin were the first and were obtained from the bacterium streptomyces peucetius 60 derivatives of these compounds include epirubicin and idarubicin other clinically used drugs in the anthracycline group are pirarubicin aclarubicin and mitoxantrone 61 the mechanisms of anthracyclines include dna intercalation molecules insert between the two strands of dna generation of highly reactive free radicals that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition 62 actinomycin is a complex molecule that intercalates dna and prevents rna synthesis 63 bleomycin a glycopeptide isolated from streptomyces verticillus also intercalates dna but produces free radicals that damage dna this occurs when bleomycin binds to a metal ion becomes chemically reduced and reacts with oxygen 64 6 87 mitomycin is a cytotoxic antibiotic with the ability to alkylate dna 65 delivery edit two girls with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving chemotherapy the girl on the left has a central venous catheter inserted in her neck the girl on the right has a peripheral venous catheter the arm board stabilizes the arm during needle insertion anti cancer iv drip is seen at top right most chemotherapy is delivered intravenously although a number of agents can be administered orally e g melphalan busulfan capecitabine according to a recent 2016 systematic review oral therapies present additional challenges for patients and care teams to maintain and support adherence to treatment plans 66 there are many intravenous methods of drug delivery known as vascular access devices these include the winged infusion device peripheral venous catheter midline catheter peripherally inserted central catheter picc central venous catheter and implantable port the devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent 7 94 95 depending on the person the cancer the stage of cancer the type of chemotherapy and the dosage intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis for continuous frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access 7 113 118 commonly used systems are the hickman line the port a cath and the picc line these have a lower infection risk are much less prone to phlebitis or extravasation and eliminate the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae citation needed isolated limb perfusion often used in melanoma 67 or isolated infusion of chemotherapy into the liver 68 or the lung have been used to treat some tumors the main purpose of these approaches is to deliver a very high dose of chemotherapy to tumor sites without causing overwhelming systemic damage 69 these approaches can help control solitary or limited metastases but they are by definition not systemic and therefore do not treat distributed metastases or micrometastases citation needed topical chemotherapies such as 5 fluorouracil are used to treat some cases of non melanoma skin cancer 70 if the cancer has central nervous system involvement or with meningeal disease intrathecal chemotherapy may be administered 4 adverse effects edit chemotherapeutic techniques have a range of side effects that depend on the type of medications used the most common medications affect mainly the fast dividing cells of the body such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth stomach and intestines chemotherapy related toxicities can occur acutely after administration within hours or days or chronically from weeks to years 6 265 in many cases an increase in tolerability reduction in side effects and enhanced therapeutic efficacy through short term fasting in the days of therapy was observed both in human and in animal experiments 71 72 73 74 immunosuppression and myelosuppression edit virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the immune system often by paralysing the bone marrow and leading to a decrease of white blood cells red blood cells and platelets anemia and thrombocytopenia may require blood transfusion neutropenia a decrease of the neutrophil granulocyte count below 0 5 x 109 litre can be improved with synthetic g csf granulocyte colony stimulating factor e g filgrastim lenograstim in very severe myelosuppression which occurs in some regimens almost all the bone marrow stem cells cells that produce white and red blood cells are destroyed meaning allogenic or autologous bone marrow cell transplants are necessary in autologous bmts cells are removed from the person before the treatment multiplied and then re injected afterward in allogenic bmts the source is a donor however some people still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow citation needed although people receiving chemotherapy are encouraged to wash their hands avoid sick people and take other infection reducing steps about 85 of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the person s own gastrointestinal tract including oral cavity and skin 75 130 this may manifest as systemic infections such as sepsis or as localized outbreaks such as herpes simplex shingles or other members of the herpesviridea 76 the risk of illness and death can be reduced by taking common antibiotics such as quinolones or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole before any fever or sign of infection appears 77 quinolones show effective prophylaxis mainly with hematological cancer 77 however in general for every five people who are immunosuppressed following chemotherapy who take an antibiotic one fever can be prevented for every 34 who take an antibiotic one death can be prevented 77 sometimes chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level in japan the government has approved the use of some medicinal mushrooms like trametes versicolor to counteract depression of the immune system in people undergoing chemotherapy 78 trilaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 4 6 approved for the prevention of myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy the drug is given before chemotherapy to protect bone marrow function 79 neutropenic enterocolitis edit due to immune system suppression neutropenic enterocolitis typhlitis is a life threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy 80 typhlitis is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including nausea vomiting diarrhea a distended abdomen fever chills or abdominal pain and tenderness typhlitis is a medical emergency it has a very poor prognosis and is often fatal unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated 81 successful treatment hinges on early diagnosis provided by a high index of suspicion and the use of ct scanning nonoperative treatment for uncomplicated cases and sometimes elective right hemicolectomy to prevent recurrence 81 gastrointestinal distress edit nausea vomiting anorexia diarrhoea abdominal cramps and constipation are common side effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast dividing cells 82 malnutrition and dehydration can result when the recipient does not eat or drink enough or when the person vomits frequently because of gastrointestinal damage this can result in rapid weight loss or occasionally in weight gain if the person eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications these side effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs low certainty evidence also suggests that probiotics may have a preventative and treatment effect of diarrhoea related to chemotherapy alone and with radiotherapy 83 however a high index of suspicion is appropriate since diarrhoea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis a very serious and potentially life threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment citation needed anemia edit anemia can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy and possible cancer related causes such as bleeding blood cell destruction hemolysis hereditary disease kidney dysfunction nutritional deficiencies or anemia of chronic disease treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production erythropoietin iron supplements and blood transfusions 84 85 86 myelosuppressive therapy can cause a tendency to bleed easily leading to anemia medications that kill rapidly dividing cells or blood cells can reduce the number of platelets in the blood which can result in bruises and bleeding extremely low platelet counts may be temporarily boosted through platelet transfusions and new drugs to increase platelet counts during chemotherapy are being developed 87 88 89 90 sometimes chemotherapy treatments are postponed to allow platelet counts to recover fatigue may be a consequence of the cancer or its treatment and can last for months to years after treatment one physiological cause of fatigue is anemia which can be caused by chemotherapy surgery radiotherapy primary and metastatic disease or nutritional depletion 91 92 aerobic exercise has been found to be beneficial in reducing fatigue in people with solid tumours 93 nausea and vomiting edit further information chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting nausea and vomiting are two of the most feared cancer treatment related side effects for people with cancer and their families in 1983 coates et al found that people receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first and second most severe side effects respectively up to 20 of people receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed or even refused potentially curative treatments 94 chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting cinv are common with many treatments and some forms of cancer since the 1990s several novel classes of antiemetics have been developed and commercialized becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in many people effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the recipient and more efficient treatment cycles due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance and better overall health hair loss edit hair loss alopecia can be caused by chemotherapy that kills rapidly dividing cells other medications may cause hair to thin these are most often temporary effects hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment but sometimes with a change in color texture thickness or style sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth resulting in chemo curls severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as doxorubicin daunorubicin paclitaxel docetaxel cyclophosphamide ifosfamide and etoposide permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non androgenic mechanism and can manifest as alopecia totalis telogen effluvium or less often alopecia areata 95 it is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles and more reversible than androgenic hair loss 96 97 although permanent cases can occur 98 chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men 99 scalp cooling offers a means of preventing both permanent and temporary hair loss however concerns about this method have been raised 100 101 secondary neoplasm edit development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment can occur the most common secondary neoplasm is secondary acute myeloid leukemia which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors 102 survivors of childhood cancer are more than 13 times as likely to get a secondary neoplasm during the 30 years after treatment than the general population 103 not all of this increase can be attributed to chemotherapy infertility edit some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility 104 chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide ifosfamide busulfan melphalan chlorambucil and chlormethine 104 drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin 104 on the other hand therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin and antimetabolites such as methotrexate mercaptopurine and 5 fluorouracil 104 female infertility by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to premature ovarian failure by loss of primordial follicles 105 this loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles 105 people may choose between several methods of fertility preservation prior to chemotherapy including cryopreservation of semen ovarian tissue oocytes or embryos 106 as more than half of cancer patients are elderly this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients a study in france between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34 of cases and a live birth in 27 of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant with the follow up time varying between 1 and 13 years 107 potential protective or attenuating agents include gnrh analogs where several studies have shown a protective effect in vivo in humans but some studies show no such effect sphingosine 1 phosphate s1p has shown similar effect but its mechanism of inhibiting the sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway may also interfere with the apoptosis action of chemotherapy drugs 108 in chemotherapy as a conditioning regimen in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation a study of people conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone for severe aplastic anemia came to the result that ovarian recovery occurred in all women younger than 26 years at time of transplantation but only in five of 16 women older than 26 years 109 teratogenicity edit chemotherapy is teratogenic during pregnancy especially during the first trimester to the extent that abortion usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy 110 second and third trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development but it may increase the risk of various complications of pregnancy and fetal myelosuppression 110 in males previously having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy 110 the use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk 110 in females previously having undergone chemotherapy miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions 110 however when in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservation is practised between or shortly after treatment possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened 110 peripheral neuropathy edit further information chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy between 30 and 40 percent of people undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy cipn a progressive enduring and often irreversible condition causing pain tingling numbness and sensitivity to cold beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs 111 chemotherapy drugs associated with cipn include thalidomide epothilones vinca alkaloids taxanes proteasome inhibitors and the platinum based drugs 111 112 whether cipn arises and to what degree is determined by the choice of drug duration of use the total amount consumed and whether the person already has peripheral neuropathy though the symptoms are mainly sensory in some cases motor nerves and the autonomic nervous system are affected 113 cipn often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment the platinum based drugs are the exception with these drugs sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment 114 some cipn appears to be irreversible 114 pain can often be managed with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment 115 cognitive impairment edit some people receiving chemotherapy report fatigue or non specific neurocognitive problems such as an inability to concentrate this is sometimes called post chemotherapy cognitive impairment referred to as chemo brain in popular and social media 116 tumor lysis syndrome edit in particularly large tumors and cancers with high white cell counts such as lymphomas teratomas and some leukemias some people develop tumor lysis syndrome the rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes the release of chemicals from the inside of the cells following this high levels of uric acid potassium and phosphate are found in the blood high levels of phosphate induce secondary hypoparathyroidism resulting in low levels of calcium in the blood this causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause cardiac arrhythmia although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in people with large tumors this is a dangerous side effect that can lead to death if left untreated 7 202 organ damage edit cardiotoxicity heart damage is especially prominent with the use of anthracycline drugs doxorubicin epirubicin idarubicin and liposomal doxorubicin the cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent dna damage other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity but at a lower incidence are cyclophosphamide docetaxel and clofarabine 117 hepatotoxicity liver damage can be caused by many cytotoxic drugs the susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself viral hepatitis immunosuppression and nutritional deficiency the liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells hepatic sinusoidal syndrome obstruction of the veins in the liver cholestasis where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine and liver fibrosis 118 119 nephrotoxicity kidney damage can be caused by tumor lysis syndrome and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be asymptomatic only seen on blood or urine tests or may cause acute kidney injury 120 121 ototoxicity damage to the inner ear is a common side effect of platinum based drugs that can produce symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo 122 123 children treated with platinum analogues have been found to be at risk for developing hearing loss 124 125 126 other side effects edit less common side effects include red skin erythema dry skin damaged fingernails a dry mouth xerostomia water retention and sexual impotence some medications can trigger allergic or pseudoallergic reactions specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ specific toxicities including cardiovascular disease e g doxorubicin interstitial lung disease e g bleomycin and occasionally secondary neoplasm e g mopp therapy for hodgkin s disease hand foot syndrome is another side effect to cytotoxic chemotherapy nutritional problems are also frequently seen in cancer patients at diagnosis and through chemotherapy treatment research suggests that in children and young people undergoing cancer treatment parenteral nutrition may help with this leading to weight gain and increased calorie and protein intake when compared to enteral nutrition 127 limitations edit chemotherapy does not always work and even when it is useful it may not completely destroy the cancer people frequently fail to understand its limitations in one study of people who had been newly diagnosed with incurable stage 4 cancer more than two thirds of people with lung cancer and more than four fifths of people with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer 128 the blood brain barrier poses an obstacle to delivery of chemotherapy to the brain this is because the brain has an extensive system in place to protect it from harmful chemicals drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain s blood vessel cells into the cerebrospinal fluid and blood circulation these transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors only small lipophilic alkylating agents such as lomustine or temozolomide are able to cross this blood brain barrier 129 130 131 blood vessels in tumors are very different from those seen in normal tissues as a tumor grows tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen hypoxic to counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow the newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor this leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the circulatory system 132 resistance edit resistance is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs there are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps known as p glycoprotein in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics research on p glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing medications to inhibit the function of p glycoprotein are undergoing investigation but due to toxicities and interactions with anti cancer drugs their development has been difficult 133 134 another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells this overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication with more copies of the gene the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis programmed cell death as most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells making them resistant many chemotherapy drugs also cause dna damage which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out dna repair upregulation of these genes can overcome the dna damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins such as tubulin can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein leading to resistance to these types of drugs 135 drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress which can kill a cancer cell however under certain conditions cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs 136 in lung cancer the transcription factor nfκb is thought to play a role in resistance to chemotherapy via inflammatory pathways 137 138 139 cytotoxics and targeted therapies edit targeted therapies are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics they are divided into two groups small molecule and antibodies the massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs they will kill any rapidly dividing cell tumor or normal targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells this allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics life threatening effects can occur initially the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind an example target for targeted therapy is the bcr abl1 protein produced from the philadelphia chromosome a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelogenous leukemia and in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia this fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib a small molecule drug 140 141 142 143 mechanism of action edit the four phases of the cell cycle g1 the initial growth phase s the phase in which dna is synthesised g2 the second growth phase in preparation for cell division m mitosis where the cell divides to produce two daughter cells that continue the cell cycle cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells coupled with malignant behaviour invasion and metastasis among other features 144 it is caused by the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors 145 146 these factors lead to accumulations of genetic mutations in oncogenes genes that control the growth rate of cells and tumor suppressor genes genes that help to prevent cancer which gives cancer cells their malignant characteristics such as uncontrolled growth 147 93 94 in the broad sense most chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing mitosis cell division effectively targeting fast dividing cells as these drugs cause damage to cells they are termed cytotoxic they prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging dna and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division 38 148 one theory as to why these drugs kill cancer cells is that they induce a programmed form of cell death known as apoptosis 149 as chemotherapy affects cell division tumors with high growth rates such as acute myelogenous leukemia and the aggressive lymphomas including hodgkin s disease are more sensitive to chemotherapy as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing cell division at any time malignancies with slower growth rates such as indolent lymphomas tend to respond to chemotherapy much more modestly 4 heterogeneic tumours may also display varying sensitivities to chemotherapy agents depending on the subclonal populations within the tumor cells from the immune system also make crucial contributions to the antitumor effects of chemotherapy 150 for example the chemotherapeutic drugs oxaliplatin and cyclophosphamide can cause tumor cells to die in a way that is detectable by the immune system called immunogenic cell death which mobilizes immune cells with antitumor functions 151 chemotherapeutic drugs that cause cancer immunogenic tumor cell death can make unresponsive tumors sensitive to immune checkpoint therapy 152 other uses edit some chemotherapy drugs are used in diseases other than cancer such as in autoimmune disorders 153 and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia in some cases they are often used at lower doses which means that the side effects are minimized 153 while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra 154 psoriasis 155 ankylosing spondylitis 156 and multiple sclerosis 157 158 the anti inflammatory response seen in ra is thought to be due to increases in adenosine which causes immunosuppression effects on immuno regulatory cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme pathways reduction in pro inflammatory cytokines and anti proliferative properties 154 although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain 156 157 158 cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat lupus nephritis a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus 159 dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for al amyloidosis recently bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for al amyloidosis other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating al amyloidosis 160 chemotherapy drugs are also used in conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplant hematopoietic stem cell transplant conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient s immune system in order to allow a transplant to engraft cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner and is often used in conjunction with total body irradiation chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient s bone marrow cells myeloablative conditioning or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss non myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning 161 when used in non cancer setting the treatment is still called chemotherapy and is often done in the same treatment centers used for people with cancer occupational exposure and safe handling edit in the 1970s antineoplastic chemotherapy drugs were identified as hazardous and the american society of health system pharmacists ashp has since then introduced the concept of hazardous drugs after publishing a recommendation in 1983 regarding handling hazardous drugs the adaptation of federal regulations came when the u s occupational safety and health administration osha first released its guidelines in 1986 and then updated them in 1996 1999 and most recently 2006 162 the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has been conducting an assessment in the workplace since then regarding these drugs occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs has been linked to multiple health effects including infertility and possible carcinogenic effects a few cases have been reported by the niosh alert report such as one in which a female pharmacist was diagnosed with papillary transitional cell carcinoma twelve years before the pharmacist was diagnosed with the condition she had worked for 20 months in a hospital where she was responsible for preparing multiple antineoplastic drugs 163 the pharmacist didn t have any other risk factor for cancer and therefore her cancer was attributed to the exposure to the antineoplastic drugs although a cause and effect relationship has not been established in the literature another case happened when a malfunction in biosafety cabinetry is believed to have exposed nursing personnel to antineoplastic drugs investigations revealed evidence of genotoxic biomarkers two and nine months after that exposure routes of exposure edit antineoplastic drugs are usually given through intravenous intramuscular intrathecal or subcutaneous administration in most cases before the medication is administered to the patient it needs to be prepared and handled by several workers any worker who is involved in handling preparing or administering the drugs or with cleaning objects that have come into contact with antineoplastic drugs is potentially exposed to hazardous drugs health care workers are exposed to drugs in different circumstances such as when pharmacists and pharmacy technicians prepare and handle antineoplastic drugs and when nurses and physicians administer the drugs to patients additionally those who are responsible for disposing antineoplastic drugs in health care facilities are also at risk of exposure 164 dermal exposure is thought to be the main route of exposure due to the fact that significant amounts of the antineoplastic agents have been found in the gloves worn by healthcare workers who prepare handle and administer the agents another noteworthy route of exposure is inhalation of the drugs vapors multiple studies have investigated inhalation as a route of exposure and although air sampling has not shown any dangerous levels it is still a potential route of exposure ingestion by hand to mouth is a route of exposure that is less likely compared to others because of the enforced hygienic standard in the health institutions however it is still a potential route especially in the workplace outside of a health institute one can also be exposed to these hazardous drugs through injection by needle sticks research conducted in this area has established that occupational exposure occurs by examining evidence in multiple urine samples from health care workers 165 hazards edit hazardous drugs expose health care workers to serious health risks many studies show that antineoplastic drugs could have many side effects on the reproductive system such as fetal loss congenital malformation and infertility health care workers who are exposed to antineoplastic drugs on many occasions have adverse reproductive outcomes such as spontaneous abortions stillbirths and congenital malformations moreover studies have shown that exposure to these drugs leads to menstrual cycle irregularities antineoplastic drugs may also increase the risk of learning disabilities among children of health care workers who are exposed to these hazardous substances moreover these drugs have carcinogenic effects in the past five decades multiple studies have shown the carcinogenic effects of exposure to antineoplastic drugs similarly there have been research studies that linked alkylating agents with humans developing leukemias studies have reported elevated risk of breast cancer nonmelanoma skin cancer and cancer of the rectum among nurses who are exposed to these drugs other investigations revealed that there is a potential genotoxic effect from anti neoplastic drugs to workers in health care settings 163 safe handling in health care settings edit as of 2018 there were no occupational exposure limits set for antineoplastic drugs i e osha or the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih have not set workplace safety guidelines 166 preparation edit niosh recommends using a ventilated cabinet that is designed to decrease worker exposure additionally it recommends training of all staff the use of cabinets implementing an initial evaluation of the technique of the safety program and wearing protective gloves and gowns when opening drug packaging handling vials or labeling when wearing personal protective equipment one should inspect gloves for physical defects before use and always wear double gloves and protective gowns health care workers are also required to wash their hands with water and soap before and after working with antineoplastic drugs change gloves every 30 minutes or whenever punctured and discard them immediately in a chemotherapy waste container 167 the gowns used should be disposable gowns made of polyethylene coated polypropylene when wearing gowns individuals should make sure that the gowns are closed and have long sleeves when preparation is done the final product should be completely sealed in a plastic bag the health care worker should also wipe all waste containers inside the ventilated cabinet before removing them from the cabinet finally workers should remove all protective wear and put them in a bag for their disposal inside the ventilated cabinet 164 administration edit drugs should only be administered using protective medical devices such as needle lists and closed systems and techniques such as priming of iv tubing by pharmacy personnel inside a ventilated cabinet workers should always wear personal protective equipment such as double gloves goggles and protective gowns when opening the outer bag and assembling the delivery system to deliver the drug to the patient and when disposing of all material used in the administration of the drugs 166 hospital workers should never remove tubing from an iv bag that contains an antineoplastic drug and when disconnecting the tubing in the system they should make sure the tubing has been thoroughly flushed after removing the iv bag the workers should place it together with other disposable items directly in the yellow chemotherapy waste container with the lid closed protective equipment should be removed and put into a disposable chemotherapy waste container after this has been done one should double bag the chemotherapy waste before or after removing one s inner gloves moreover one must always wash one s hands with soap and water before leaving the drug administration site 168 employee training edit all employees whose jobs in health care facilities expose them to hazardous drugs must receive training training should include shipping and receiving personnel housekeepers pharmacists assistants and all individuals involved in the transportation and storage of antineoplastic drugs these individuals should receive information and training to inform them of the hazards of the drugs present in their areas of work they should be informed and trained on operations and procedures in their work areas where they can encounter hazards different methods used to detect the presence of hazardous drugs and how the hazards are released and the physical and health hazards of the drugs including their reproductive and carcinogenic hazard potential additionally they should be informed and trained on the measures they should take to avoid and protect themselves from these hazards this information ought to be provided when health care workers come into contact with the drugs that is perform the initial assignment in a work area with hazardous drugs moreover training should also be provided when new hazards emerge as well as when new drugs procedures or equipment are introduced 166 housekeeping and waste disposal edit when performing cleaning and decontaminating the work area where antineoplastic drugs are used one should make sure that there is sufficient ventilation to prevent the buildup of airborne drug concentrations when cleaning the work surface hospital workers should use deactivation and cleaning agents before and after each activity as well as at the end of their shifts cleaning should always be done using double protective gloves and disposable gowns after employees finish up cleaning they should dispose of the items used in the activity in a yellow chemotherapy waste container while still wearing protective gloves after removing the gloves they should thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water anything that comes into contact or has a trace of the antineoplastic drugs such as needles empty vials syringes gowns and gloves should be put in the chemotherapy waste container 169 spill control edit a written policy needs to be in place in case of a spill of antineoplastic products the policy should address the possibility of various sizes of spills as well as the procedure and personal protective equipment required for each size a trained worker should handle a large spill and always dispose of all cleanup materials in the chemical waste container according to epa regulations not in a yellow chemotherapy waste container 170 occupational monitoring edit a medical surveillance program must be established in case of exposure occupational health professionals need to ask for a detailed history and do a thorough physical exam they should test the urine of the potentially exposed worker by doing a urine dipstick or microscopic examination mainly looking for blood as several antineoplastic drugs are known to cause bladder damage 163 urinary mutagenicity is a marker of exposure to antineoplastic drugs that was first used by falck and colleagues in 1979 and uses bacterial mutagenicity assays apart from being nonspecific the test can be influenced by extraneous factors such as dietary intake and smoking and is therefore used sparingly however the test played a significant role in changing the use of horizontal flow cabinets to vertical flow biological safety cabinets during the preparation of antineoplastic drugs because the former exposed health care workers to high levels of drugs this changed the handling of drugs and effectively reduced workers exposure to antineoplastic drugs 163 biomarkers of exposure to antineoplastic drugs commonly include urinary platinum methotrexate urinary cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide and urinary metabolite of 5 fluorouracil in addition to this there are other drugs used to measure the drugs directly in the urine although they are rarely used a measurement of these drugs directly in one s urine is a sign of high exposure levels and that an uptake of the drugs is happening either through inhalation or dermally 163 available agents edit main article list of antineoplastic agents there is an extensive list of antineoplastic agents several classification schemes have been used to subdivide the medicines used for cancer into several different types 171 172 history edit main article history of cancer chemotherapy sidney farber did pioneering work in chemotherapy the first use of small molecule drugs to treat cancer was in the early 20th century although the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during world war i and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of hematopoiesis blood production 173 a similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during world war ii at the yale school of medicine 174 it was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer 174 therefore in december 1942 several people with advanced lymphomas cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes were given the drug by vein rather than by breathing the irritating gas 174 their improvement although temporary was remarkable 175 concurrently during a military operation in world war ii following a german air raid on the italian harbour of bari several hundred people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas which had been transported there by the allied forces to prepare for possible retaliation in the event of german use of chemical warfare the survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts 176 after wwii was over and the reports declassified the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer the first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was mustine since then many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer and drug development has exploded into a multibillion dollar industry although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply 177 the term chemotherapy edit the word chemotherapy without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment but its historical meaning was broader the term was coined in the early 1900s by paul ehrlich as meaning any use of chemicals to treat any disease chemo therapy such as the use of antibiotics antibacterial chemotherapy 178 ehrlich was not optimistic that effective chemotherapy drugs would be found for the treatment of cancer 178 the first modern chemotherapeutic agent was arsphenamine an arsenic compound discovered in 1907 and used to treat syphilis 179 this was later followed by sulfonamides sulfa drugs and penicillin in today s usage the sense any treatment of disease with drugs is often expressed with the word pharmacotherapy sales edit the top 10 best selling in terms of revenue cancer drugs of 2013 180 no 2013 global sales inn trade names marketing

drugs main article experimental cancer treatments targeted therapies edit specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells this should result in an increased tumor kill or reduced toxicity or both 181 antibody drug conjugates edit antibody drug conjugates adcs comprise an antibody drug and a linker between them the antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells known as a tumor antigen or on cells that the tumor can utilise such as blood vessel endothelial cells they bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised where the linker releases the drug into the cell these specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability selectivity and choice of target but in essence they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells 182 reduced systemic toxicity means that they can also be used in people who are sicker and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches citation needed the first approved drug of this type was gemtuzumab ozogamicin mylotarg released by wyeth now pfizer the drug was approved to treat acute myeloid leukemia 183 two other drugs trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin are both in late clinical trials and the latter has been granted accelerated approval for the treatment of refractory hodgkin s lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma 182 nanoparticles edit nanoparticles are 1 1000 nanometer nm sized particles that can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low solubility drugs nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively passive targeting exploits the difference between tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels blood vessels in tumors are leaky because they have gaps from 200 to 2000 nm which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor active targeting uses biological molecules antibodies proteins dna and receptor ligands to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells there are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems such as silica polymers liposomes 184 and magnetic particles nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field 181 they have emerged as a useful vehicle in magnetic drug delivery for poorly soluble agents such as paclitaxel 185 electrochemotherapy edit main article electrochemotherapy electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor the treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells such as bleomycin and cisplatin to enter the cancer cells hence greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin 186 187 188 189 190 191 the method has been reported as safe simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy according to the esope project european standard operating procedures of electrochemotherapy the standard operating procedures sop for electrochemotherapy were prepared based on the experience of the leading european cancer centres on electrochemotherapy 188 192 recently new electrochemotherapy modalities have been developed for treatment of internal tumors using surgical procedures endoscopic routes or percutaneous approaches to gain access to the treatment area 193 194 hyperthermia therapy edit hyperthermia therapy is heat treatment for cancer that can be a powerful tool when used in combination with chemotherapy thermochemotherapy or radiation for the control of a variety of cancers the heat can be applied locally to the tumor site which will dilate blood vessels to the tumor allowing more chemotherapeutic medication to enter the tumor additionally the tumor cell membrane will become more porous further allowing more of the chemotherapeutic medicine to enter the tumor cell hyperthermia has also been shown to help prevent or reverse chemo resistance chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past especially using cddp resistant cells in regard to the potential benefit that drug resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs e g mitomycin c anthracyclines bcnu melphalan including cddp could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat 195 other animals edit chemotherapy is used in

egyptian literature the process that amun used to create the world is associated with the tilapia s method of mouth brooding commerce edit the fisherman by charles napier hemy 1888 main article commercial fishing according to the fao there were about 39 million fishers in countries producing more than 200 000 tonnes in 2012 which is nearly 140 the number in 1995 the total fishery production of 66 million tonnes equated to an average productivity of 3 5 tonnes per person 2 most of this growth took place in asian countries where four fifths of world fishers and fish farmers dwell 2 most fishers are women and men involved in offshore and deep sea fisheries women and men fish in some regions inshore from small boats or collect shellfish and seaweed in many artisanal fishing communities women or men are responsible for making and repairing nets post harvest processing and marketing 2 recreation edit main article recreational fishing recreational fishing is fishing for pleasure or competition it can be contrasted with commercial fishing which is fishing for economic profit or subsistence fishing which is fishing for survival the most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod reel line hooks and any one of a wide range of baits lures are frequently used in place of bait some people make handmade lures including plastic lures and artificial flies the practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is called angling and fishermen using this technique are sometimes referred to as anglers when angling it is sometimes expected or required that the fish be caught and released big game fishing is fishing from boats to catch large open water species such as tuna sharks and marlin noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities communities edit main articles fishing village and artisan fishing for some communities fishing provides not only a source of food and work but also community and cultural identity 5 safety issues edit a royal air force search and rescue sea king helicopter comes to the aid of the french fishing vessel alf during a storm in the irish sea see also work in fishing convention 2007 the fishing industry is hazardous for fishers between 1992 and 1999 us commercial fishing vessels averaged 78 deaths per year the main contributors to fatalities are 6 inadequate preparation for emergencies poor vessel maintenance and inadequate safety equipment lack of awareness of or ignoring stability issues many fishers while accepting that fishing is dangerous staunchly defend their independence many proposed laws and additional regulation to increase safety have been defeated because fishers oppose them 6 alaska s commercial fishers work in one of the world s harshest environments many of the hardships they endure include isolated fishing grounds high winds seasonal darkness very cold water icing and short fishing seasons where very long work days are the norm fatigue physical stress and financial pressures face most alaska fishers through their careers out of 948 work related deaths that took place in alaska during 1990 2006 one third 311 occurred to fishermen this is equivalent to an estimated annual fatality rate of 128 100 000 workers year this fatality rate is 26 times that of the overall u s work related fatality rate of approximately 5 100 000 workers year for the same time period 7 while the work related fatality rate for commercial fishers in alaska is still very high it does appear to be decreasing since 1990 there has been a 51 percent decline in the annual fatality rate the successes in commercial fishing are due in part to the u s coast guard implementing new safety requirements in the early 1990s these safety requirements contributed to 96 percent of the commercial fishers surviving vessel sinkings capsizings in 2004 whereas in 1991 only 73 percent survived while the number of occupational deaths in commercial fishers in alaska has been reduced there is a continuing pattern of losing 20 to 40 vessels every year there are still about 100 fishers who must be rescued each year from cold alaska waters successful rescue is still dependent on the expertly trained personnel of the us coast guard search and rescue operations and such efforts can be hindered by the harshness of seas and the weather furthermore the people involved in search and rescue operations are themselves at considerable risk for injury or death during these rescue attempts 7 gallery edit a fisherman and his catch including small sharks hooked on hand lines miles

in the beginning we both got the feeling that it had something to do with king arthur and the knights of the round table we thought if we could make a modern version of that spirit and the feeling that would be a new kind of comic that hadn t been done and we would enjoy doing it so we worked out a third world war where life was almost destroyed and crime was all over and the atomic knights stand for justice and faith and all that so that is the way the story began 2 the original atomic knights edit the only atomic knights cover appearance in strange adventures 144 the giant dalmatians are also present on the cover the atomic knights appeared in every third issue of strange adventures in the early 1960s beginning with 117 june 1960 and running through 160 january 1964 3 in all there were 15 early 1960s atomic knights stories created by writer john broome and artist murphy anderson they were a band of heroes living in and protecting the post apocalyptic future of 1992 following the catastrophic hydrogen war of 1986 a petty tyrant named the black baron ruled a small section of the midwestern united states with an iron fist he was opposed by sgt gardner grayle and the atomic knights who wore medieval suits of armor that were impervious to the baron s energy weapons the armor having been irradiated in the war 4 the other knights were twins wayne and hollis hobard bryndon smith the last scientist left on earth and brother and sister douglas and marene herald the group became a symbol of hope to the survivors of the cataclysm 5 the atomic knights mid 70s incarnation the 15 atomic knights stories in strange adventures took place in real time three months usually passed between the events of each story as well as in the real world and generally dealt with post holocaust recovery as the knights would fend off menaces and attempt to rebuild the area around their home base of durvale though they also managed to travel to los angeles detroit new orleans new

comic books published by dc comics kalibak is the eldest son of darkseid the half brother of orion and grayven and an enemy of superman and the justice league 1 2 created by jack kirby being debuted with the rest of the new gods first appearing in new gods 1 february 1971 in an era called the silver age of comic books he is originally and recurrently depicted as the brutish son of darkseid commonly seeking affection of his father who he had a tragic childhood with he is also depicted as second in command as leader of apokolips and rival to another of darkseid son orion 3 kalibak s name is derived from the william shakespeare character name caliban the half man from the tempest 4 5 6 7 kalibak is the first born son of darkseid and suli his mother suli is killed by desaad acting under orders from kalibak s grandmother queen heggra kalibak becomes a legendary warrior and often serves as darkseid s second in command after darkseid breaks the pact of peace with new genesis the rival planet of kalibak s home apokolips he aids his father in the resulting battles 8 kalibak is often pitted against orion and after numerous clashes they learned that they were half brothers this fuels kalibak s hatred of orion to new levels for darkseid clearly respects orion over his first born unlike orion kalibak secretly craves the love and respect of his father something neither he nor anyone else can ever hope to attain and it has been shown that he has a gentle side which is completely submerged under his brutish exterior and which he consistently and fearfully keeps hidden because on apokolips any sign of weakness is subject to the cruelest punishment for his part darkseid is more lenient towards kalibak s failures than those of his other servants having slain him he always returns him to life it is implied this is because his eldest son is the offspring of the one person darkseid truly loved as well being one of the only few of his followers with genuine loyalty at one point kalibak is desperate enough to confront orion without darkseid s consent kalibak s scheme fell apart and he kills his accomplice desaad also a servant of darkseid to cover his tracks darkseid was not pleased when he found out and reduced his son to a pile of ash after enough time had passed darkseid resurrected kalibak hoping the boy had learned a lesson kalibak later spends some time in an apokolips prison on darkseid s orders in orion 1 june 2000 darkseid is on earth when orion invades apokolips justeen a servant of desaad releases kalibak to battle orion yet again kalibak is swiftly subdued but does not care much as orion leaves to battle darkseid and kalibak hopes to gain power as a result during the universe wide genesis incident apokolips forces including kalibak invade earth in young heroes in love 5 kalibak and his small squad of parademons are defeated by the leader of the young heroes the telekinetic and telepathic hard drive 9 kalibak is slain by his uncle infinity man who has been murdering the residents of apokolips and new genesis as an agent of the source wall in death of the new gods in final crisis the new fifth world and human version of

with communist ideology and more recently with socialism for other uses see red star disambiguation a red five pointed star a red star five pointed and filled is a symbol that has often historically been associated with communist ideology particularly in combination with the hammer and sickle but is also used as a purely socialist symbol in the 21st century it has been widely used in flags state emblems monuments ornaments and logos one interpretation sees the five points as representing the five fingers of the worker s hand as well as the five populated continents counting the americas as one a lesser known suggestion is that in communist symbolism the five points on the star were intended to represent the five social groups that would lead russia to communism the youth the military the industrial labourers the agricultural workers or peasantry and the intelligentsia in soviet heraldry the red star symbolized the red army and military service as opposed to the hammer and sickle which symbolized peaceful labour citation needed different countries across europe treat the symbol very differently some former warsaw pact nations have passed laws banning it claiming that it represents a totalitarian ideology 1 but other eastern european countries hold a very positive view of it as a symbol of antifascism and resistance against nazi occupation citation needed red star has also been used in a non communist context and before the emergence of this movement in symbols of countries and states since the 19th century it appears for example on the flags of new zealand and the u s state of california red star has also been used as logo by private agencies and corporations such as the oil giant texaco and beer multinational heineken a new year tree with a red star in front

1908 the star s origins as a symbol of communist mass movements dates from the time of the bolshevik revolution and the russian civil war but the precise first use remains unknown the red star as a symbol of the red army was proposed by the military collegium for the organization of the red army and the creator of the red star emblem was the bolshevik commander of the petrograd military district konstantin eremeev 2 on the other hand one account of the symbol s origin traces its roots to the moscow troop garrison toward the end of world war i at this time many troops were fleeing from the austrian and german fronts joining the local moscow garrison upon their arrival in the city to distinguish the moscow troops from the influx of retreating front liners officers gave out tin stars to the moscow garrison soldiers to wear on their hats when those troops joined the red army and the bolsheviks they painted their tin stars red the color of socialism thus creating the original red star 3 the red star was used in communist media as early as in 1908 with the publication of the novel red star by bolshevik revolutionary alexander bogdanov which describes a technologically advanced communist civilization on mars 4 another claimed origin for the red star relates to an alleged encounter between leon trotsky and nikolai krylenko krylenko an esperantist wore a green star lapel badge trotsky inquired as to its meaning and received an explanation that each arm of the star represented one of the five traditional continents on hearing that trotsky specified that soldiers of the red army should wear a similar red star 5 regardless of the star s exact origin it was incorporated into the red army s uniforms and heraldry as early as 1918 6 u s army signal corps curtiss jn 3 biplanes

edit see also hammer and sickle legal status and bans on communist symbols the red star and the hammer and sickle are regarded as occupation symbols as well as symbols of totalitarianism and state terror by several countries that were formerly either members of or occupied by the soviet union accordingly latvia 18 lithuania 19 hungary 20 and ukraine 21 22 23 have banned the symbol among others deemed to be symbols of totalitarian political ideologies and the soviet union or its republics in poland the parliament passed in 2009 a ban that referred generally to fascist communist or other totalitarian symbols while not specifying any of them 24 following a constitutional complaint it has been abolished by the constitutional tribunal as contrary to articles in the constitution of poland guaranteeing the freedom of speech a similar law was considered in estonia but eventually failed in a parliamentary committee due to its conflict with freedoms guaranteed by the constitution of estonia the european court of human rights has ruled in a similar manner against the laws that ban political symbols which were deemed to be in clear opposition with basic human rights such as freedom of speech 25 26 confirmed again in 2011 in case fratanolo v hungary 27 the decision has been compared 28 to the legislation concerning the symbols of nazism which continue to be banned in several

29 in 2003 hungarian politician attila vajnai was arrested handcuffed and fined for wearing a red star on his lapel during a demonstration he appealed his sentence to the european court of human rights which decided that the ban was a violation of the freedom of expression calling the hungarian ban indiscriminate and too broad 30 in slovenia the red star was historically associated with the

to make him the anti slade where slade hides in the shadows brother blood loves the spotlight slade always has some ulterior motive brother blood will tell you what he s planning right away so there s

against divine law 1 each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin while sins are generally considered actions any thought word or act considered immoral selfish shameful harmful or alienating might be termed sinful 2 contents 1 etymology 2 bahá í 3 buddhism 4 christianity 4 1 hamartiology 4 2 original sin 5 islam 6 judaism 7 shinto 8 see also 9 notes and references 10

sundijō sin from proto indo european h₁s ónt ih₂ from h₁sónts being true implying a verdict of truly guilty against an accusation or charge from h₁es to be compare old english sōþ true see sooth doublet of suttee bahá í edit main article bahá í views on sin baháʼís consider humans to be naturally good fundamentally spiritual beings human beings were created because of god s immeasurable love for us however the baháʼí teachings compare the human heart to a mirror which if turned away from the light of the sun i e god is incapable of receiving god s love it is only by turning unto god that spiritual advancement can be made in this sense sinning is to follow the inclinations of one s own lower nature to turn the mirror of one s heart away from god one of the main hindrances to spiritual development is the baháʼí concept of the insistent self which is a self serving inclination within all people baháʼís interpret this to be the true meaning of satan often referred to in the baháʼí writings as the evil one watch over yourselves for the evil one is lying in wait ready to entrap you gird yourselves against his wicked devices and led by the light of the name of the all seeing god make your escape from the darkness that surroundeth you baháʼu lláhthis lower nature in humans is symbolized as satan the evil ego within us not an evil personality outside ʻabdu l bahá buddhism edit main article buddhist views on sin there are a few differing buddhist views on sin american zen author brad warner states that in buddhism there is no concept of sin at all 3 4 the buddha dharma education association also expressly states the idea of sin or original sin has no place in buddhism 5 ethnologist christoph von fürer haimendorf explained in buddhist thinking the whole universe men as well as gods are subject to a reign of law every action good or bad has an inevitable and automatic effect in a long chain of causes an effect that is independent of the will of any deity even though this may leave no room for the concept of sin in the sense of an act of defiance against the authority of a personal god buddhists speak of sin when referring to transgressions against the universal moral code 6 however anantarika kamma in theravada buddhism is a heinous crime which through karmic process brings immediate disaster 7 in mahayana buddhism these five crimes are referred to as pañcānantarya pāli and are mentioned in the sutra preached by the buddha on the total extinction of the dharma 8 the five crimes or sins are 9 injuring a buddha killing an arhat creating schism in the society of sangha matricide patricide christianity edit hamartiology edit main article christian views on sin see also seven deadly sins the doctrine of sin is central to christianity since its basic message is about redemption in christ 10 christian hamartiology describes sin as an act of offense against god by despising his persons and christian biblical law and by injuring others 11 in christian views it is an evil human act which violates the rational nature of man as well as god s nature and his eternal law according to the classical definition of st augustine of hippo sin is a word deed or desire in opposition to the eternal law of god 12 13 thus sin requires redemption a metaphor alluding to atonement in which the death of jesus is the price that is paid to release the faithful from the bondage of sin 14 in some forms of christianity it also requires reparation see penance among some scholars sin is understood mostly as a legal infraction or contract violation of non binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of christian ethics and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms other christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational a loss of love for the christian god and an elevation of self love concupiscence in this sense as was later propounded by augustine in his debate with the pelagians 15 as with the legal definition of sin this definition also affects the understanding of christian grace and salvation which are thus viewed in relational terms 16 original sin edit main article original sin a sistine chapel fresco depicts the expulsion of adam and eve for transgressing god s command not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil this condition has been characterized in many ways ranging from something as insignificant as the tendency toward sin referred to as a sin nature to something as drastic as total depravity the teaching that humans apart from god s grace are incapable of choosing to do good 17 18 the concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by irenaeus bishop of lyon in his controversy with certain dualist gnostics 19 other church fathers such as augustine also shaped and developed the doctrine 20 seeing it as based on the new testament teaching of paul the apostle romans 5 12 21 and 1 corinthians 15 21 22 and the old testament verse of psalms 51 5 21 22 23 24 25 tertullian cyprian ambrose and ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in adam s sin transmitted by human generation augustine s formulation of original sin after 412 ce was popular among protestant reformers such as martin luther and john calvin who equated original sin with concupiscence or hurtful desire affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom to do good before 412 ce augustine said that free will was weakened but not destroyed by original sin but after 412 ce this changed to a loss of free will except to sin 26 modern augustinian calvinism holds this later view the jansenist movement which the catholic church declared to be heretical also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will 27 instead the catholic church declares that baptism erases original sin 28 methodist theology teaches that original sin is eradicted through entire sanctification 29 islam edit main article islamic views on sin sin is an important concept in islamic ethics muslims see sin as anything that goes against the commands of god allah a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion 30 islam teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being it is believed that god weighs an individual s good deeds against his or her sins on the day of judgement and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds these individuals are thought to be sentenced to an afterlife in the fires of jahannam hell islamic terms for sin include dhanb and khaṭīʾa which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins khiṭʾ which means simply a sin and ithm which is used for grave sins 31 judaism edit main article jewish views on sin judaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil sin has many classifications and degrees but the principal classification is that of missing the mark cheit in hebrew 32 better source needed some sins are punishable with death by the court others with death by heaven others with lashes and others without such punishment but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins since sin cannot be a sin if the one who committed it did not know it was wrong unintentional sins are considered less severe sins 33 sins between people are considered much more serious in judaism than sins between man and god yom kippur the main day of repentance in judaism can atone for sins between man and god but not for sins between man and his fellow that is until he has appeased his friend 34 eleazar ben azariah derived this from the verse from all your sins before god you shall be cleansed book of leviticus 16 30 for sins between man and god yom kippur atones but for sins between man and his fellow yom kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow 35 36 when the temple yet stood in jerusalem people would offer korbanot sacrifices for their misdeeds the atoning aspect of korbanot is carefully circumscribed for the most part korbanot only expiate unintentional sins that is sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by mistake no atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge and for the most part korbanot cannot atone for a malicious deliberate sin in addition korbanot have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of his or her actions before making the offering and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation 33 judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences the completely righteous suffer for their sins by humiliation poverty and suffering that god sends them in this world and receive their reward in the world to come the in between not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous the very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave gehinnom because they do not or cannot repent this world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer while the wicked prosper many great thinkers have contemplated this 37 shinto edit the shinto concept of sin is inexorably linked to concepts of purity and pollution shinto does not have a concept of original sin instead believing that all human beings are born pure 38 sin also called tsumi is anything that makes people impure i e anything that separates them from the kami 39 however shinto does not believe this impurity is the result of human actions but rather the result of evil spirits or other external factors 38 39 sin can have a variety of consequences in japan including disaster and disease 38 39 because of this purification rituals or harae are viewed as important not just to the spiritual and physical health of the individual but to the well being of the nation 38 see also edit actual sin devil ethics in religion haram

the new teen titans 2 in december 1980 christopher j priest said 1 n ot only was marv s deathstroke a villain he was also kind of an asshole which i thought was unique he wasn t some misunderstood anarchist he deliberately did skeevy things most notably sleeping with terra a presumably underage girl in his quest to exact revenge against his enemies i read that and went whoa this was beyond the joker well beyond lex luthor marv created the first modern supervillain he broke every rule by making deathstroke three dimensional and giving him internal conflicts while maintaining a level of skeeve we weren t used to seeing from a typical 2 dimensional bad guy due to his popularity deathstroke received his own series deathstroke the terminator in 1991 5 it was retitled deathstroke the hunted for issues 0 and 41 45 and then simply deathstroke for issues 46 60 the series was cancelled with issue 60 in total deathstroke ran for 65 issues 1 60 plus four annuals and a special 0 issue following his injury in dc universe last will and testament deathstroke appears in one of the four faces of evil one shots written by david hine hine has explained that the series is part of the setup for future stories all of the characters in this faces of evil series were selected for their potential as major players in the coming year 6 even though the character of deathstroke the terminator predates james cameron s film the terminator by four years the slade wilson character is now simply called deathstroke even though he was initially introduced as deathstroke the terminator in his first appearance and usually referred to only as the terminator and as termy by other characters for decades the full title has not completely fallen out of use having been referenced as recently as justice league elite fictional character biography edit slade wilson as deathstroke the terminator as he was originally depicted on the cover of tales of the teen titans 44 july 1984 art by george pérez slade wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the united states army having lied about his age after serving a stint in korea he was later assigned to camp washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major in the early 1960s he met captain adeline kane who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in vietnam kane was amazed at how skilled slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare she immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able bodied combatant that she had ever encountered she offered to privately train slade in guerrilla warfare in less than a year slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel six months later adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child the war in vietnam began to escalate and slade was shipped overseas in the war his unit massacred a village an event which sickened him he was also rescued by sas member wintergreen to whom he would later return the favor chosen for a secret experiment the army imbued him with a drug that allowed him to utilize and use up to 90 of his brain s capacity granting him enhanced physical powers and near mastery control of his body accelerated healing factor and heightened senses in an attempt to create metahuman super soldiers for the u s military deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend wintergreen who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge 7 however slade kept this career secret from his family even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor a criminal named the jackal took his younger son joseph wilson hostage to force slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin slade refused claiming it was against his personal honor code he attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous unfortunately joseph s throat was slashed by one of the criminals before slade could prevent it destroying joseph s vocal cords and rendering him mute after taking joseph to the hospital adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill slade by shooting him but only managed to destroy his right eye afterwards his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision marked by his mask which has a black featureless half covering his lost right eye without his mask slade wears an eye patch to cover his eye he is described being 6 ft 5 in 1 96 m tall the teen titans edit slade has a long history as an enemy of the teen titans beginning when his other son grant received superhuman enhancements from the h i v e dubbed himself ravager and accepted a contract from them to kill or capture the teen titans 8 however grant s enhancements proved fatal and slade agreed to complete the contract his first mission involved stealing the element promethium from s t a r labs and selling it as the ultimate weapon he then kidnapped the titans and placed them in the path of a promethium bomb to test his device for the buyers effectively killing two birds with one stone the titans escaped and pursued deathstroke but he severely wounded beast boy in his escape this would be the start to a lasting animosity between the two deathstroke next appeared in new york holding officials hostage in order to lure the titans into confronting him terra a new ally of the titans and beast boy were the only ones available to answer the call terra knocked beast boy out and fought deathstroke single handedly in an effort to prove herself worthy of being a titan deathstroke escaped as the other titans arrived but by then terra had proven herself and the team offered her membership later that night it was revealed that terra and deathstroke had conspired to fake the fight in a plot to infiltrate the team 9 the judas contract edit the titans eventually entrusted terra with all of their secret identities once slade had this information he used it to systematically subdue each of the titans exploiting them at their weakest moments donna troy was gassed at her photo studio changeling was anesthetized with tainted envelopes while responding to fan mail victor stone was electrically shocked by a chair in his own apartment koriand r was ambushed with a device that affected her powers and raven was taken down by terra herself nightwing was last to be attacked and he was confronted by deathstroke himself he avoided being captured and soon discovered that his teammates had already been taken nightwing arrived at titans tower to discover slade s ex wife and son she told nightwing that terra was a traitor how each of his teammates were captured and related the origin of deathstroke nightwing in order to confront deathstroke and the h i v e joined jericho joseph wilson during the confrontation deathstroke recognized jericho as his son which caused him to hesitate jericho freed the titans by possessing his father s body after terra died during the battle slade was then taken into custody 10 slade was put on trial for his crimes but the trial was deliberately sabotaged by changeling so that he could kill slade himself believing that he was responsible for terra s betrayal of the titans slade agreed to the confrontation but showed up out of costume changeling found himself unable to kill slade so instead they talked feeling some empathy for his grief slade explained his past with terra and changeling realized that slade was not to blame for the choices that terra had made the two men parted on peaceful terms with slade returning to africa with wintergreen titans plague edit months later slade encountered the titans again while they were investigating mysterious attacks and disappearances donna troy is attacked by a group of strange beastmen and barely survives the encounter meanwhile while attending a fundraiser with his father gar logan recognizes slade trying to maintain a low profile when he finally catches up with slade he finds him about to kill the host of the fundraiser walter lanier he stops deathstroke but is surprised when lanier turns into a bat like creature and flies away slade reveals to the titans that he was responsible for smuggling the drug the bestiamorphs were using to transform others but did not realize what it was until it was too late after jericho and raven were stricken by the plague he aided them in destroying the beastmen and finding a cure for the contagion titans hunt edit shortly after this he came to the titans assistance again during the titans hunt storyline the members of the titans as well as many inactive members all disappeared in a manner very similar to how they were abducted during the judas contract mento an on and off member of the doom patrol hires deathstroke to find the missing titans he eventually discovers with nightwing that the abductions were the work of the wildebeest society and that their leader was none other than titans member jericho deathstroke s son it was revealed that jericho had been possessed by the corrupted souls of azarath as they were using him to capture the titans and use them as physical hosts in order to survive during the transfer process jericho s true self resurfaced briefly begging his father to kill him to spare his son any more pain and save the remaining titans slade was forced to drive a sword through jericho s heart seemingly killing him afterward slade continued his life as a mercenary but also acted as an occasional ally to the titans aiding them when mutual threats outweighed their rivalry most notably during the total chaos storyline when the team titans arrived in the 20th century to assassinate donna troy before she could give birth to her son who in their timeline had grown up into the tyrannical despot lord chaos slade also met pat trayce a tough former cop who would become the new vigilante pat trayce became slade s lover later on and the two developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship family business edit after slade foiled an assassination attempt on the president of the united states he was subsequently framed for the murder of a u s senator the man responsible had taken on the identity of the ravager and was hunting down slade s friends and loved ones eventually with the help of the titans and sarge steel slade was able to prove his innocence and the true culprit was revealed to be steve dayton under the alias of the crime lord who had again succumbed to mental instability caused by his mento helmet meanwhile slade s relationship with his estranged wife adeline took a tragic turn as slade underwent a process to gain the ability of physical regeneration allowing him to survive any wound so long as his brain is intact but this power is limited as slade cannot regenerate his lost eye because that injury happened before he gained his healing factor after gaining this power slade was forced to give his wife a blood transfusion to save her life resulting in her gaining a similar healing factor which manifested itself as a form of immortality this alteration of her dna drove adeline insane shaming deathstroke into going into a semi retirement state in titans 12 deathstroke teamed up with the titans to face his wife adeline who in her insane state had revived the h i v e and sought to rid the world of all superhumans blaming them for jericho s apparent death during the battle interrupted by vandal savage and a band of villains that he had organized from recent titans battles adeline s throat was slit in a brief return of sanity she begged slade to kill her requesting him to reunite her with my our children because her version of the healing factor would not heal the wound but only allow her to live in spite of it deathstroke refused but koriand r shocked her teammates and deathstroke by using her starbolt blast to disintegrate her completely per adeline s wishes this was a turning point as deathstroke renounced all ties with the titans as a result of starfire s act it was then revealed that jericho managed to transfer his consciousness into deathstroke in the instant before his death taking control of his father jericho forced deathstroke to murder his longtime butler mentor and confidant wintergreen he then launched a series of attacks against the current teen titans most notably shattering impulse s knee with a shotgun blast before leaving his father s body deathstroke has since manipulated his one remaining child rose wilson into the mercenary business as the new ravager in order to find and kill jericho using a specially designed serum to heighten her hostility and push her over the edge unfortunately the process also resulted in her being driven at least partially insane to the extent that she cut out her own left eye in an attempt to prove to her father that she was just like him nightwing and birds of prey edit deathstroke appeared in nightwing vol 2 23 as a mercenary against black canary and conner hawke as part of the brotherhood of the fist tie in to the no man s land story arc 11 deathstroke also appeared in birds of prey 22 24 where he was sent to gorilla city by blockbuster to get an ape heart he is accompanied by lady vic grimm and black canary who is posing as oracle identity crisis edit in the identity crisis miniseries deathstroke was enlisted as a bodyguard for doctor light who was being pursued by the justice league of america as a suspect in the murder of sue dibny in the ensuing battle deathstroke nearly beat the team of elongated man flash zatanna hawkman green arrow black canary atom and green lantern he systematically took out every member except for rayner whom he had the potential to disable through trying to usurp his ring s energies using his own formidable willpower but before the outcome of this conflict with green lantern ended green arrow stuck an arrow in deathstroke s right eye socket enraging him slade went ballistic which derailed his pre planned strategy and began to beat green arrow but was stopped when the majority of the team tackled deathstroke to the ground dr light used his powers to allow the two to escape near the end of identity crisis deathstroke confronts green arrow on a rooftop arrow sees his reflection in the windows of a nearby building but when he turns to confront slade deathstroke is gone instead green arrow finds slade s cowl and a note stuck to the wall by the very arrow he stabbed in slade s eye socket the note reads this is yours we re not done infinite crisis edit deathstroke was a founding member of lex luthor s secret society of super villains in the infinite crisis storyline he was seen in infinite crisis 1 hiding in a warehouse south of metropolis waiting to ambush the freedom fighters with several other members the battle did not last long and by the end deathstroke had killed the phantom lady slade is also the one who landed the final stroke on uncle sam by shooting him in the back and leading to his apparent death 7 he was the employer of nightwing whom he hired to train his daughter rose however after the two have a confrontation with superman deathstroke discovers that nightwing had been teaching rose the values of heroism he could not kill grayson in front of his daughter because doing so would undo all of slade s teachings nightwing offered a deal he would stay away from rose if slade would keep the metahuman villains out of blüdhaven the deal held for 34 hours until infinite crisis 4 when slade under the orders of alexander luthor jr the real leader of the society went with several villains including old titans and doom patrol foes and brotherhood of evil members monsieur mallah and brain to drop chemo another fellow villain who appeared to be a nearly brainless monster made of pure energy and radioactive chemicals on blüdhaven killing over 100 000 people slade gave the explanation to the brotherhood that nightwing should be made to believe that he can never go home again nightwing took the first of his revenge by bursting in on deathstroke and rose s training session revealing to the latter that the kryptonite that deathstroke had implanted in place of her missing eye was radioactive and deadly to humans as well as to kryptonians as revealed by luthor s old possession of a kryptonite ring that had forced him to transfer his brain to a cloned body angered slade went after nightwing with a grenade only to have rose try to stop him amid the smoke of the resulting explosion rose fled telling her father that she hated him nightwing disappeared as well but not before leaving a note for slade warning him that he would be back to make him pay for blüdhaven at the climactic battle of metropolis at the conclusion of infinite crisis slade was confronted by batman robin and nightwing during the struggle he was questioned regarding his motives for aiding the secret society his claims of monetary motivation were deemed unsatisfactory batman accused him of having forsaken his code of honor and nightwing said it was because his family had abandoned him enraged slade said that was because of nightwing and that it was always because of him before batman told him to take responsibility for his actions and he was rendered unconscious one year later edit cover of teen titans vol 3 43 titans east part 1 art by tony daniel slade appears in the green arrow series after the one year jump in dc comics storylines apparently in hiding he nearly murders a crony of several star city businessmen who want to hire him for a murder before finishing his violent refusal he asks the name of the target when informed that it was to be the mayor of star city oliver queen whom deathstroke knows is secretly green arrow he spares the lackey and decides to take the job 12 however things do not quite go according to plan with green arrow using the resources of both his identities trapping him within a ring of armed national guardsmen 13 the fight ends with deathstroke s arrest 14 and subsequent conviction and incarceration 15 however this is revealed as a ploy to gain access to constantine drakon another jailed foe of green arrow who has information on the hero s activities in the lost year 16 which include green arrow studying under natas an assassin who once trained deathstroke himself 17 deathstroke is also active behind the scenes in teen titans currently in the process of organizing a counter team of teen superhumans that will be known as titans east the current titans team included ravager who now wanted nothing to do with her father deathstroke seemingly intended to reclaim ravager and a recently resurrected jericho from the titans or if that failed to crush them along with the rest of the team for these reasons he specially selected each member of titans east believing that overall each member would successfully counteract every member of the current teen titans line up as indicated over the course of the subsequent issues deathstroke was manipulating every member of his new team in one way or another he had blackmailed former titan risk while at the same time offering him an outlet for his rage was drugging batgirl with the same serum he had used on rose and supplied inertia with a formula that granted superhuman speed to compensate for the loss of the speed force following the initial battle with superboy prime his team however slowly fell apart over the course of the attack as robin managed to free batgirl of his mind control serum and raven convinced duela dent to switch sides slade and his remaining titans subsequently faced off against both the current titans and a group of old titans led by nightwing although he was defeated he still managed to escape with the aid of inertia in the end however it was revealed to the readers that slade s real mission was to provide his children with something he could never offer them a real family in the form of the teen titans by attacking the titans he insured that rose and jericho would become more trusted by their associates and thus grow closer to the team recently deathstroke took credit for somehow twisting through unknown means the powers of geo force the half brother of the original terra into the same powers as his traitorous sister using this leverage deathstroke offered to reverse the process only if geo force became his own personal spy within the justice league unfortunately for deathstroke geo force alerted batman superman and wonder woman of deathstroke s scheme which culminated in geo force alerting the league that deathstroke whose rivalry with green arrow had reached vendetta level proportions planned on using an army of supervillains to crash green arrow and black canary s wedding weeks later geo force was tortured by gorilla grodd after the league was kidnapped by the injustice league and ultimately transferred to batman s newest incarnation of the outsiders afterward robbing deathstroke of his potential pawn deathstroke can be seen as a member of libra s secret society of super villains deathstroke is gravely injured with his own sword by geo force in dc universe last will and testament following his injury he is recuperating at belle reve while doctors labor to save him deathstroke dreams of his family members and all of the people that he has let down when he awakens he vows that he will never again be haunted by the past ravager comes to visit him but in fact wants to finish her father off she tries to strangle him with a plastic wire but deathstroke is recuperated enough that he can fend off her attack he escapes from the facility and steals a helicopter later deathstroke finds a young street urchin that he decides to take under his wing 18 blackest night edit in the teen titans vol 3 tie in to the blackest night crossover event deathstroke is living in the deceased wintergreen s house and reading his journal when he is attacked by rose again during the fight the two are attacked by their deceased relatives grant wade and adeline who along with wintergreen have all been reanimated as black lanterns deathstroke and rose are forced to work together and fight for their lives against the black lanterns 19 the two hopelessly fight the regenerating black lanterns until jericho cured from his earlier insanity arrives and turns the tide of the fight during the course of the battle deathstroke confesses to his children that part of the reason why he menaced the teen titans for so many years was that he felt that by forcing his children to hate him they would have a chance of escaping the sorrow and pain that a life with him would entail just as slade is overwhelmed and about to be killed jericho somehow uses his abilities to sever the connection between the black lanterns and their power rings permanently sending them back to the grave after realizing that her mother was not reborn as a member of the black lantern corps rose comes to the conclusion that she must somehow still be alive and leaves after threatening to kill slade if he tries to stop her jericho chooses to stay with his father reasoning that only slade would have the courage to kill him if he were to ever return to madness 20 batman and robin edit recently deathstroke has been seen working with talia al ghul controlling the body and physical actions of the current robin in order to kill the recent batman deathstroke is able to control robin s actions thanks to a neural implant inserted into robin s spine by his mother while it was being surgically replaced batman defeats deathstroke by taking advantage of the two way connection between him and robin by using a taser on robin the resulting electric shock overwhelming deathstroke s enhanced senses he then tracks slade down and attacks him in his hospital bed for controlling robin and for the chemo attack informing slade that what happened then is just a trailer for what he will do later 21 titans villains for hire edit following the encounter with the black lanterns deathstroke recruits a team of supervillains consisting of tattooed man

suitcase he had in his possession deathstroke subsequently betrays and kills the alpha dogs enraged by the notion that his employers feel that he is unable to accomplish his tasks alone deathstroke then begins to take on increasingly dangerous missions in an effort to prove his worth but is also spurred on by the contents of the suitcase he retrieved from bode namely the mask and knife belonging to his son grant both of which were stained with fresh blood indicating that he may be still alive 34 during this time deathstroke is pursued by a new villain known as legacy 35 deathstroke kills legacy but another legacy donning the same colors as the last one appears again and again it turns out the parents of one of the alpha dog members have hired multiple mercenaries to kill deathstroke all donning the green and purple color to get revenge on him deathstroke tracks them down but is confronted by his son grant it is revealed that all of this has been a plot to lure deathstroke to him although deathstroke manages to kill both the parents grant defeats him claiming superiority over deathstroke grant is about to finish slade but he hesitates and leaves recovering from his injuries grant takes another contract slade is happy that his son has become a better warrior than him and then visits his father s hospital bed to mention that he has grown up to be a greater man than him slade takes a contract from harvest to bring the ravagers back to the colony he does this in exchange for his daughter rose and terra it turns out that lynch the leader of team 7 had needed terra to stop a rampaging majestic who was thought to be killed by dinah drake s sonic scream for a plan b to slade s dismay he calls in joseph wilson now going by the name jericho with adeline and grant to stop majestic instead of stopping majestic jericho takes control of majestic adeline grant and terra in order to kill his father adeline dies buried in the rubble caused by majestic s stampede jericho

terra unconscious a cornered jericho threatens to stab himself and grant with a sword deathstroke without hesitation drives the sword into both of them killing them instantly but a later scene suggests jericho has escaped since there is shown a worker with glowing green eyes walking out of the clean up scene strongly implying jericho has possessed the man to flee origins edit deathstroke s altered origin is introduced in deathstroke vol 2 0 the fact that he participated in the military at 16 and met adeline has not changed already a legend in the army slade was drafted into team 7 and

sons grant and joseph around this time slade received intel that his best friend wintergreen was caught in somalia he donned a mask and flew to somalia to rescue wintergreen slaughtering all the captors deathstroke the terminator was born as his fame grew his enemies did too an attack targeting his house seemingly killed joseph and adeline with evidence that the attack was from north korea slade killed a group of north korean soldiers but lost his right eye in the process it is later shown that joseph and adeline are still alive this origin was again changed in teen titans deathstroke 1 after a mission that involved destroying a children s hospital which slade was unaware of he quit the army after team 7 s termination slade started to operate under the deathstroke identity he took grant on his mission considering him as not only his son but as a business partner and the only person he could trust but during a mission in north korea their refuge was infiltrated and north korean soldiers barged in firing into the house grant was shot and as slade looked back at his son a bullet penetrated his right eye blinding it enraged slade went on a massacre and slew the soldiers however grant was presumed dead now slade works for the sake of his daughter rose as he knows the only thing that will keep rose safe after he is gone is money it is unclear if rose s mother is adeline or not team 7 edit five years before taking the contract from harvest before taking the name deathstroke slade once operated with team 7 with metahuman threats rising the majestic project a plan to control future metahuman threats was devised by john lynch and to secure the project team 7 was created and slade was recruited the first mission was retrieving the eclipso gem where slade was possessed by

spartan subject to target agent james bronson currently at his home a spartan cyborg breaks into his apartment and attacks activating majestic majestic actually turns out to be agent bronson s gen factor which was activated when the kaizen the dictator of the island nation of gamorra sent the cyborg to trigger the majestic persona it is later explained by lynch that another purpose of team 7 was to activate potential metagenes in the agents to create powerful human weapons which would make america invincible to other nations agents like slade dinah drake and cole cash had gained their metahuman abilities by lynch bronson was planned to be majestic but the activation of the gene just then had been unexpected team 7 s last mission was to salvage pandora s box the team with new pilot

his brother s house only to find him dead mardon s brother clyde a scientist had just discovered a way to control the weather before dying of a heart attack although recent evidence implies that mardon murdered his brother and either lied about or blocked out the memory of finding his body 2 mardon took clyde s notes and used them to make a wand to generate weather and embarked on a criminal career as the weather wizard sometimes using his powers on a small scale such as zapping someone with lightning and sometimes a larger scale imprisoning a town in winter almost always facing defeat by the flash barry allen 3 after barry allen s death during the crisis on infinite earths the weather wizard went into semi retirement for a while until during underworld unleashed he teamed up with other rogues which included captain cold heat wave captain boomerang and mirror master as part of a ploy for greater power ultimately it ended with their deaths and the release of the demon neron they were later resurrected as soulless demons by neron to use against barry allen s successor wally west who manipulated neron to return the rogues souls the weather wizard and the others except for heat wave returned to a life of crime weather wizard joined up with blacksmith and her rogues through her he learns he has a son from a one night stand with keystone city police officer julie jackham their son josh had exhibited internalized weather controlling abilities and mardon wanted to have the same ability without the use of his wand he tried to kidnap josh from wally s wife linda and dissect him to understand out how his son gained that ability but hesitated to harm the child when he noticed that the child had my eyes my brother s eyes he was stopped by flash and sent to iron heights but escaped after blacksmith s group disbanded the weather wizard along with mirror master and trickster joined up with captain cold who declared himself the leader of the rogues mardon was also the representative of the rogues for the secret society of super villains one year later edit one year later he and several other rogues are approached by inertia with a plan to kill the flash then bart allen inertia destroyed weather wizard s wand and used 30th century psychological therapies to remove the mental blocks which prevented him from using his powers without it though inertia is eventually defeated the other rogues beat bart to death weather wizard using his control over lightning to electrocute him after allen s identity was revealed mardon was surprised and horrified to discover that the rogues had killed a kid 4 salvation run edit weather wizard is one of the exiled villains featured in salvation run along with his fellow rogues captain cold heat wave mirror master and abra kadabra final crisis rogues revenge edit he was seen as the member of rogues who joined libra s secret society of super villains in the final crisis rogues revenge series however weather wizard and the rest of the rogues reject libra s offer wanting to stay out of the game captain cold even berates mirror master for working with scum like dr light before they can retire they hear of inertia escaping and decide to stick around long enough to get revenge for being used 5 in retaliation libra kidnaps josh and tries to get mardon to join the society threatening to kill the boy if he does not to which mardon responds if i killed my brother libra if i electrocuted the only person who ever cared about me what makes you think i care anything about that child libra then taunts mardon to prove him wrong mardon is hesitant to make a move when inertia kills the boy himself and mardon joins his fellow rogues in defeating and killing inertia 6 the flash vol 3 edit weather wizard and the rogues visit sam scudder s old hideout and unveil a giant mirror with the words in case of flash break glass written on it 7 afterward mardon is still on the run with the rogues 8 the new 52 edit

minutescountryunited stateslanguageenglishbudget 8 12 million 1 2 box office 3 million 3 looker is a 1981 american science fiction film 1 written and directed by michael crichton and starring albert finney susan dey and james coburn 4 the film is a suspense science fiction piece that comments upon and satirizes media advertising television s effects on the populace and a ridiculous standard of beauty though sparse in visual effects the film is the first commercial film to attempt to make a computer generated three dimensional solid looking model of a whole human body however as with its predecessors futureworld star wars and alien this was an example of cgi representing cgi and only depicted on crt screens in the film rather than being used as a special effect the model had no skeletal or facial movements and was not a character looker was also the first film to create three dimensional 3d shading with a computer 5 months before the release of the better known tron contents 1 plot 2 cast 3 production 4 reception 5 see also 6 references 7 external links plot edit dr larry roberts finney a beverly hills plastic surgeon is puzzled when four beautiful models working in television commercials request cosmetic surgery to make changes so minor as to be imperceptible to the naked eye when these models later start dying under mysterious circumstances he discovers they are all linked to the same advertisement research firm the digital matrix research firm rates advertising models using a scoring system to measure the combined visual impact of various physical attributes in television commercials in an experiment to increase their scores some models are sent to dr roberts to get cosmetic surgery to maximize their visual impact though the models are physically perfect after the surgery they still are not as effective as desired so the research firm decides to use a different approach each model is offered a contract to have her body scanned digitally to create 3d computer generated models then the 3d models are animated for use in commercials the contracts seem to be incredibly lucrative for the models once their bodies are represented digitally they get a paycheck for life never having to work again since their digital models are used for all their future work in commercials however when these same models start dying under mysterious circumstances roberts becomes suspicious and decides to investigate digital matrix he has a strong interest in investigating the deaths he is considered a prime suspect by the police from evidence planted at the scene of one of the murders and his most recent patient cindy susan dey with whom he begins a romantic relationship cindy is the last of the models to be digitally scanned during his investigation roberts discovers some advanced technology that the digital matrix corporation is using to hypnotize consumers into buying the products they advertise he also discovers a light pulse device the light ocular oriented kinetic emotive responses l o o k e r gun that gives the illusion of invisibility by instantly mesmerizing its victims into losing all sense of time cast

belfield terri welles as lisa convey terry kiser as commercial director production edit crichton started thinking about the subject of the film in 1975 6 he says he went to a los angeles computer company to find out how they could create copies in commercials without looking too ridiculous and discovered a company in texas was already doing it called tomography 7 looker became an early production of the ladd company 8 it was leigh taylor young s first film in eight years 9 james coburn later said my part was pretty much on the cutting room floor they really pissed that film away they had albert finney running around in a security guard s uniform throughout the film it didn t make any sense it could have been a good picture it was about how television controls it was about how commercials manipulate people to buy products politicians whatever but they cut the film up for a television print i don t know why they did that they spent some bread on the picture too it was a 12 million production that s not much today but back then it was a pretty big budget 2 reception edit looker was poorly received by critics particularly film historian leonard maltin an intriguing premise is mishandled the result is illogical and boring even albert finney cannot save this turkey 10 the film holds a 32 rating on rotten tomatoes based on 22 reviews 11 it was not a success at the

derived from an early name for chester and was first recorded as legeceasterscir in the anglo saxon chronicle 7 meaning the shire of the city of legions 8 although the name first appears in 980 it is thought that the county was created by edward the elder around 920 8 in the domesday book chester was recorded as having the name cestrescir chestershire derived from the name for chester at the time 7 a series of changes that occurred as english itself changed together with some simplifications and elision resulted in the name cheshire as it occurs today because of the historically close links with the land bordering cheshire to the west which became modern wales there is a history of interaction between cheshire and north wales the domesday book records cheshire as having two complete hundreds atiscross and exestan that later became the principal part of flintshire additionally another large portion of the duddestan hundred later became known as maelor saesneg when it was transferred to north wales 9 for this and other reasons the welsh language name for cheshire swydd gaerlleon is sometimes used 10 history edit main articles history of cheshire and timeline of cheshire history earldom edit the strategic location of the earldom of chester the only county palatine on the welsh marches 11 pura wallia independent wales lands gained by llywelyn the great in 1234 marchia wallie lands controlled by norman marcher barons after the norman conquest of 1066 by william i dissent and resistance continued for many years after the invasion in 1069 local resistance in cheshire was finally put down using draconian measures as part of the harrying of the north the ferocity of the campaign against the english populace was enough to end all future resistance examples were made of major landowners such as earl edwin of mercia their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst norman barons the earldom was sufficiently independent from the kingdom of england that the 13th century magna carta did not apply to the shire of chester so the earl wrote up his own chester charter at the petition of his barons 12 county palatine edit william i made cheshire a county palatine and gave gerbod the fleming the new title of earl of chester when gerbod returned to normandy in about 1070 the king used his absence to declare the earldom forfeit and gave the title to hugh d avranches nicknamed hugh lupus or wolf because of cheshire s strategic location on the welsh marches the earl had complete autonomous powers to rule on behalf of the king in the county palatine hundreds edit hundreds of cheshire in domesday book areas highlighted in pink became part of flintshire in wales cheshire in the domesday book 1086 is recorded as a much larger county than it is today it included two hundreds atiscross and exestan that later became part of north wales at the time of the domesday book it also included as part of duddestan hundred the area of land later known as english maelor which used to be a detached part of flintshire in wales 13 the area between the mersey and ribble referred to in the domesday book as inter ripam et mersam formed part of the returns for cheshire 14 15 although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south lancashire was part of cheshire 15 16 more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between cheshire and what was to become lancashire remained the river mersey 17 18 19 with minor variations in spelling across sources the complete list of hundreds of cheshire at this time are atiscross bochelau chester dudestan exestan hamestan middlewich riseton roelau tunendune warmundestrou and wilaveston 20 feudal baronies edit there were 8 feudal baronies in chester the barons of kinderton halton malbank mold shipbrook dunham massey and the honour of chester itself feudal baronies or baronies by tenure were granted by the earl as forms of feudal land tenure within the palatinate in a similar way to which the king granted english feudal baronies within england proper an example is the barony of halton 21 one of hugh d avranche s barons has been identified as robert nicholls baron of halton and montebourg 22 north mersey to lancashire edit in 1182 the land north of the mersey became administered as part of the new county of lancashire resolving any uncertainty about the county in which the land inter ripam et mersam was 23 over the years the ten hundreds consolidated and changed names to leave just seven broxton bucklow eddisbury macclesfield nantwich northwich and wirral 24 principality merging of palatine and earldom edit map of cheshire in 1577 in 1397 the county had lands in the march of wales added to its territory and was promoted to the rank of principality this was because of the support the men of the county had given to king richard ii in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the cheshire guard as a result the king s title was changed to king of england and france lord of ireland and prince of chester no other english county has been honoured in this way although it lost the distinction on richard s fall in 1399 25 lieutenancy north split off edit district edit through the local government act 1972 which came into effect on 1 april 1974 some areas in the north became part of the metropolitan counties of greater manchester and merseyside 26 stockport previously a county borough altrincham hyde dukinfield and stalybridge in the north east became part of greater manchester much of the wirral peninsula in the

created by writer alfred bester and artist martin nodell 1 in the story he has pointed demonic ears and reveals he is a million year old cro magnon man who was made ageless when he was exposed to gas from an exploding meteor the story ends when the green lantern alan scott causes savage to fall into a seemingly bottomless pit four years later he made his second appearance in all star comics 37 1947 wherein he was recruited to join the original injustice society a team of villains that battled the justice society of america the story featured savage targeting hawkman who decades later would be established as one of savage s most frequent enemies 2 during the silver age of comic books dc rebooted its universe of superheroes altering some character histories while also creating new versions of familiar characters the silver age version of the flash barry allen and his contemporaries were later said to live in the universe of earth one the golden age flash golden age green lantern and the justice society of america were retroactively said to be inhabitants of earth two where their stories took place this made vandal savage an inhabitant of earth two as well sixteen years after his second comic book story vandal savage returned in the flash 137 june 1963 this comic established he was closer to 50 thousand years old than 1 million years old and also revealed that his original name had been vandar adg after this he became a recurring enemy to the heroes of earth two and earth one sometimes crossing the dimensional barrier between the two realities frequently he battled the flashes and superman in action comics 515 516 1981 the story indicated vandal savage was no longer just ageless but could also heal from any physical injury even near disintegration the story shows savage seemingly reduced to ash by a meteorite but superman concludes the villain will still return in action comics 542 1983 this is proven correct and savage reveals his body was able to heal and reform even from near total destruction two years after vandal savage s return to comics in the silver age strange adventures 177 1965 introduced a hero called the immortal man whenever the immortal man died or was killed his powerful amulet allowed him to quickly materialize in a new body elsewhere on earth without having to literally be born again and with his memories intact the immortal man initially appeared in four stories then disappeared from comics for seventeen years he returned in a two part story in action comics 552 553 1984 written by marv wolfman with art by gil kane in this story it was said the immortal man and vandal savage were archenemies across history and had been since before they had gained their powers the immortal man s amulet was also revealed to be a piece of the same meteorite that made savage immortal the same story featured the immortal man forming a team of forgotten heroes to fight savage during the crossover crisis on infinite earths the immortal man seemingly died giving up his reincarnation energy to help save reality as a result of this crossover the histories of earth one and earth two were merged and revised into a new unified dc universe altering some character histories in the process the crossover was followed by history of the dc universe a two part mini series intended to establish the basic history of the new timeline although within a few years several parts of it were already dismissed and contradicted by new stories history of the dc universe 1 established for the first time that vandar adg s people were known as the blood tribe while the immortal man came from the bear tribe the same issue showed that the meteor which made vandal savage immortal also enhanced his intelligence and altered his body explaining why he resembled a modern homo sapiens when other stories claimed he was originally cro magnon over time new revelations were made about vandal savage such as the fact that he kept track of his children and descendants in case he needed to harvest them for organs and replacement parts since his ability to heal has weakened over time the comic book series resurrection man said savage and the immortal man were not made immortal by radiation or gases from the meteorite they encountered but by sub atomic robots it carried called tektites that entered their bloodstreams the same comic book series revealed that along with the immortal man savage has also regularly fought mitchell shelley the resurrection man across history likewise it was revealed that vandal savage had regularly fought the reincarnating heroes hawkman and hawkgirl across many of their lives sometimes being responsible for their deaths the crossover final crisis depicts characters believing vandal savage is the inspiration for the story of cain from the bible in 2011 dc rebooted its history again with the new 52 timeline in the new 52 series demon knights it was said that vandal savage worked alongside several heroes and warriors during the dark ages fighting evil rather than causing it during these days savage is a mirthful often drunk warrior who enjoys a fight as a break from boredom in 2016 dc rebirth restored much of the pre new 52 history while making some new changes the 2017 comic book dark days the forge and the 2018 series the immortal men established that vandal savage and the immortal man were part of a larger group of primitive humans who all became immortal as a result of encountering the meteor the council of immortals fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit in his debut story vandal savage has pointed demonic ears but this is not seen again in subsequent stories vandal savage manipulates the green lantern and his secret identity alan scott into helping his schemes later revealing he knows they are the same person vandal savage explains that he is one million years old and was once a cro magnon man who was the chief of his tribe when a meteor exploded above him strange gases affected him he was left in a comatose state for months then woke up as an immortal barring accidents no longer aging but still vulnerable to injury savage does not reveal his original name to the green lantern but claims that over the years he has lived under many identities including an ancient king of sumer the egyptian architect cheops julius caesar and genghis khan when he realized he could still die from injury he decided to no longer act as a public man of power and instead would serve as an advisor to powerful leaders such as napoleon gaining resources and political influence while others could be the target for assassination now in the modern day he wishes to become a powerful figure in the government and war industry in the end he is defeated when green lantern opens a seemingly bottomless pit beneath him causing him to fall out of sight 3 years later he is revealed to be alive and recruited to the original incarnation of the injustice society a group dedicated to defeating the heroic justice society of america during this adventure he targets and captures jsa member hawkman the justice society proves victorious however and vandal savage is imprisoned 4 by the early 1950s the justice society members largely retire years later jay garrick the flash a founding member of the justice society is visited by barry allen the flash of a parallel universe and a founding member of the justice league barry designates his own home as earth one and the world of the justice society and injustice society as earth two after 16 years of prison vandal savage has his freedom again and lures the justice society members out of retirement capturing them he accidentally attracts the attention of barry allen who aids the older heroes against the villain as a result of the adventure the justice society decides to return to semi active duty 5 starting in this same story vandal savage is now said to be 50 000 years old rather than one million and his original name is revealed to be vandar adg the stories now say the meteor that mutated him did so through radiation rather than exotic gases and that it did not actually explode but warped through space and time a later story reveals that a fragment of the same radioactive meteor is recovered by a caveman named klarn of the bear tribe an enemy of vandar adg who then makes it into an amulet with this amulet klarn gains a unique reincarnation ability every time he is killed or died he quickly reappears elsewhere on earth in a new body fully clothed and with his memories of all past lives intact becoming one of savage s most frequent enemies over the millennia he is known to many as the immortal man 6 following his failure to hold the justice society prisoner vandal savage realizes he is not only aging but completely losing his immortality he learns that the meteor that made him immortal in the first place did not explode into ash as he thought but actually warped through space and time crossing through dimensions and into limbo savage manipulates jay garrick and barry allen into helping him free the meteor back into earth s atmosphere hoping another exposure will recharge his immortality instead it seemingly destroys him 7 since savage was shifting between the dimensions of earth one and earth two just before the meteor impacted with him he is now stuck in a partial existence between both worlds only able to achieve tangibility in one while only being a shadow form in the other he also temporarily gains the ability to project messages and images into the minds of others though he regains his full state of physical being later and returns to earth two he still fails to regain his immortality 8 later on he uses the superman of earth two as a power source to recharge his immortality savage hopes to also take all of superman s power but earth two s heroes arrive and foil the scheme 9 later on savage once again immortal alters the history of earth one so that he has been its ruler for centuries with superman serving as his trusted enforcer realizing savage is actually a cruel leader who censors news media so only good things are said about his rule superman joins the rebellion against the villain and then restores the original history traveling back in time to when he first gained his power savage is seemingly destroyed by the radiation of the meteor that made him immortal 10 later his body rebuilds itself from the ash either due to his healing always being this powerful or because the meteor s radiation temporarily enhanced his immortal abilities deciding to conquer the world through technology savage remains on modern day earth one and creates the technological research corporation abraxas in metropolis pretending to be an altruistic scientist and businessman while secretly continuing his plans for conquest and battling superman 11 later on the immortal man having apparently relocated to earth one recruits a team of forgotten heroes to combat savage s schemes 6 during the crisis on infinite earths when the multiverse is in danger of being destroyed vandal savage tries to take advantage of the chaos alongside many other villains several villains and heroes die during the crisis and the immortal man sacrifices himself to protect earth seemingly exhausting his reincarnation energy post crisis edit as a result of the crisis several universes merged into one single timeline creating a new version of history where the justice society and justice league had always lived on the same earth with one team forming decades after the other in this new history savage is still originally a cro magnon warrior called vandar adg now said to have been leader of the blood tribe 12 the post crisis version of savage is more bloodthirsty and it is suggested by some that he is the first cannibal on record in human history as with the silver age stories the meteor that made him immortal is one that travels by warping through space and time now specifically said to have originated from the future savage eventually learns the meteor didn t empower him through radiation but by infecting him with sub atomic robots it carried called tektites these tektites make him ageless and able to heal from great damage and lethal wounds while also increasing his intelligence making him more human in form and increasing his strength reflexes resiliency to injury and tolerance to pain the immortal man is still present at savage s origin and still fashions an amulet from a piece of the meteor it is now said the presence of tektites in both their bodies allows the two enemies to sense each other and sometimes be drawn to each other 13 though he is unaware of it at the time vandar adg had intestinal cancer when he was made immortal this affects the cancer cells as well preserving them and making them unable to be removed throughout the centuries the cancer causes savage great bouts of pain and discomfort 14 along with the immortal man savage makes enemies of many across history including the early human anthro 15 and the immortal mystic known as the phantom stranger 16 at different points in history savage faces batman due to the hero becoming temporarily lost wandering through time as a result of the final crisis 17 similarly savage often fights the time traveler rip hunter and his allies across the millennia 18 as he grows older savage realizes he has three human enemies who constantly reincarnate though unlike the immortal man they do so in the traditional sense needing to literally be reborn as children again following each death two of these enemies are known as prince khufu and his wife chay ara in their original lives fated to meet each other and fall in love in all subsequent lives in the early 20th century they are reborn as carter hall and shiera saunders hawkman and hawkgirl vandal savage compares the two reincarnating hawk heroes to cockroaches savage s other reincarnating enemy is a man named mitchell shelley who is reborn time and time again and usually recalls the events of his past lives leading him to essentially becoming the same person time and time again in many lives shelley fights vandal savage becoming his most frequent enemy next to the immortal man 19 vandal savage claims to have been several noteworthy figures of history but it has been shown that at least some of these boasts are false a means of taking credit and seeming more important at times he enjoys being a soldier for glory or a minor conqueror more often unwilling to test how much damage his immortality can repair he is content to be an advisor behind the scenes while temporarily living in ancient atlantis the center of magic on earth savage founds a secret society known as the children of the light this organization helps topple the power of atlantis before the continent sinks savage s followers leave and spread across earth becoming known as the illuminati savage serves as its secret leader for many years 18 in ancient egypt savage is known as khafre and makes an enemy of nabu who will one day merge with a human host to become the superhero doctor fate 18 as superheroes rise in the modern day savage believes he has found enemies worthy of fighting directly this leads him to confront green lantern alan scott in the 1940s and then join the injustice society to fight the hero s comrades when he later decides the justice society of america have become too formidable vandal savage uses his influence on several senators to shut the heroes down in 1951 the house un american activities committee openly questions if the jsa members are secret spies and communists pressuring them to reveal their identities and serve the u s government the jsa choose to retire instead which savage considers a victory as it means an end to widespread superhero activity for decades 20 at some point after the retirement of the jsa vandal savage fathers a daughter whom he names scandal as with many children he has had over the centuries vandal dismisses any notions of love or affection towards scandal however he comes to admire her warrior spirit and talent for violence leading him to protect her at times in the hopes that she will one day provide an even more formidable heir whom he can use many years later the debut of superman leads to the modern age of superheroes the justice league forms and vandal savage winds up opposing them by this time savage has begun funding clandestine terrorist organizations and advanced scientific research both to increase his resources and due to his realizing his immortality is weaker than it used to be savage starts tracking down his descendants in order to rely on them for organ transplants if he needs them as his body now has a harder time regenerating full organs if they are too greatly damaged related to this he funds research into cloning wally west the latest hero to be called the flash realizes vandal savage is hiding under the alias of burt villers an art dealer the two have a brief battle 21 soon afterward one of savage s scientific projects leads to the creation of velocity 9 a highly addictive drug that imbues a person with superhuman speed savage releases this drug to criminals who then perform high speed crimes but the velocity 9 causes accelerated aging and severe strokes the velocity 9 scheme is thwarted by wally west 22 later on wally s friend and fellow teen titans founder roy harper known as arsenal is revealed to be one of savage s descendants 23 soon after the crisis on infinite earths savage captures the immortal man he then funds the lab a group attempting to recreate the tektites that make the villain immortal the lab experiments on blood samples taken from both savage and the immortal man hoping to understand the sub atomic technology 24 by this time mitchell mitch shelley has reincarnated now living as a lawyer in viceroy south carolina though suffering from visions and dreams of his past lives shelley is unable to learn the full truth of his past before he is targeted for death by enemies though he survives he wanders the streets brain damaged and amnesiac later he is coincidentally kidnapped by the lab as savage s organization is now testing its tektite technology by injecting it into homeless people and seeing if they survive lethal injuries shelley s ability to reincarnate and remember his past lives seems to interact with the tektites turning him into a resurrection man now whenever he is killed he always returns and each time he does so he possesses a different additional super power after escaping the lab shelley s memories return in part and he recalls his long time rivalry with vandal savage with the forgotten heroes shelley confronts savage and learns the immortal man has been his prisoner for years when a tektite empowered creature emerges from a time warp apparently from the same source that produced the meteor that gave vandal savage and immortal man their power years ago it causes chaos and starts to disrupt reality shelley immortal man and savage join forces against the creature in the end the immortal man uses his own tektite field to overload the creature s own technology killing them both in the process 13 when the now adult founding members of the teen titans decide to reform the group under the name the titans they soon interfere with one of vandal savage s schemes to counter them savage creates his own team of villains known as tartarus the mythological prison of the ancient titans 25 the members include the red panzer gorilla grodd lady vic siren and cheshire both an enemy of the titans and the mother of roy harper s child lian tartarus targets adeline wilson a leader of the terrorist group the h i v e to use her blood for a new immortality serum before the titans can stop him savage slits wilson s throat the red panzer dies in the subsequent battle savage then shoots cheshire distracting the titans as he and his other recruits escape the titans then rescue their old teammate omen from tartarus and the tide is turned after the siren changes sides the villain group disbands 26 soon before the events of infinite crisis vandal savage joins the newly reorganized secret society of super villains now simply calling itself the society meanwhile his now adult daughter scandal savage joins the newest group to call itself the secret six a team that opposes the society s agenda savage later reveals that he believes scandal and her secret six teammate the catman would produce a suitable and formidable heir scandal however is romantically involved with the woman knockout seeing this as defiance savage threatens knockout and the team 27 vandal savage becomes leader of a doomsday cult and endows his followers with a variety of superhuman abilities thanks to a serum based on his own blood though they lose these abilities without regular injections his recruit fantasia then casts illusions to trick the flash into bringing savage an alien summoner device deciding that the planet is overpopulated and no longer an enjoyable place for him to live savage intends to use the summoner to force the thanatos asteroid to crash to earth causing an apocalypse event and thinning out the herd of the human race the flash reverses the effect of the device pushing the asteroid away but then savage leaps into the path of the beam believing he will gain greater power from the asteroid just as a meteor once gave him power before as he is sent to the asteroid he declares that he will protect the flash and his family and heirs as thanks for wally west s help in his achievement of new power 28 as savage vanishes his followers are rounded up and their abilities fade savage s immortality allows him to survive on the meteor and he later returns to earth by hitching a ride on a comet that is headed in that direction 29 a story in jsa classified 10 13 depicts savage with his immortality and regenerative abilities now drained and suffering from a brain tumor believing he will die soon savage decides to try one last act of revenge against alan scott the first superhero he ever fought and his first true enemy of the modern era when this fails savage consumes a clone of himself in order to restore his power at least temporarily this story claims savage no longer has descendants to harvest for survival and says he is only 37 000 years old both of which contradict comics published before and afterward leaving the story s place in canon questionable 30 savage later returns as the mastermind behind a group of superhuman neo nazis called the fourth reich targeting the heirs of several golden age superheroes they kill the heroes minute man general glory and mister america along with their families the fourth reich kills nearly all of commander steel s family the battle ends when the fourth reich is defeated and savage is struck down

known as the question who manages to steal the spear and reunite the spectre with his host the spectre sentences savage to walk the earth unable to disguise the mark of cain on his face to be reviled and denied rest until god says otherwise 34 the superhero team known as the outsiders meet a group calling themselves the insiders members of savage s tribe who were also exposed to the power of the meteor he encountered all gaining immortality as a result the insiders seek out meteorite fragments of the original meteor while savage forms a temporary alliance with the near immortal terrorist cult leader ra s al ghul to thwart the group by this time savage begins to believe he is in fact the biblical figure cain he succeeds in ridding himself of the mark of cain by passing it on to the question 35 montoya then removes the mark of cain from herself simply by acknowledging her flaws and shortcomings a feat vandal savage could never consider 36 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc

free of imprisonment after superman s identity is exposed and he finds himself losing his powers superman eventually learns that savage is responsible for his power drain after somehow infecting superman with a form of radiation that hinders his body s ability to absorb sunlight after capturing most of the justice league and stealing superman s fortress of solitude savage reveals that the comet which empowered him before will be passing by earth again and he intends to collect it with the aid of some of his mortal descendants all of whom gain power as the comet approaches reaching the comet he gains greater power and attempts to recruit superman to his side after superman is able to cure himself of the radiation inhibiting his powers through a risky form of kryptonite chemotherapy rejecting savage s offer superman sends the comet away causing savage to revert to his default form and power level 39 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 in the new history vandal savage is one of a group of five people who are made immortal by a radioactive meteorite that fell to earth many thousands of years before recorded history this group becomes the council of immortals hoping to shape the human race from the shadows each of these immortals including savage can share their ability to stop aging with others creating many followers down through the centuries in the modern day vandal savage attempts to create a new injustice gang but his

technology such as energy based weapons a suit that allows him limited flight or a pen sized sonic device that can immobilize people with super speed in the original golden age and silver age stories vandal savage was ageless but could still die by injury which is the traditional definition of immortality over time he began gradually aging and then lost his immortality completely in the twentieth century before finding a way to regain it for a brief time when he existed out of phase with his home dimension of earth two savage was able to mentally project messages and images 43 starting in the 1980s savage was depicted not only as ageless but also having superhuman healing abilities meaning his body could repair itself from lethal damage and destruction he also exhibited greater strength speed reflexes resiliency to injury and tolerance to pain than the average human being in the 1990s it was revealed that the source of his power was not radiation induced mutation but a colony of sub atomic robots called tektites inhabiting his bloodstream and cells these tektites work to preserve and rebuild his body by any means necessary over time this immortality has weakened and savage has had to rely on his children descendants or clones for organ replacement and blood transfusions he has also funded research into tektite replication later stories revealed savage had intestinal cancer when he acquired his immortality the regenerative power that keeps him alive also keeps the cancerous cells from being removed throughout his life this causes savage intermittent bouts of pain 14

regular injections of the serum 28 following dc rebirth it is indicated that savage s blood can also be used to make another person ageless during the final crisis crossover event savage bore the metaphysical mark of cain on his face though the mark could vanish if the bearer recognized their own shortcomings and flaws savage did not realize this and passed it on to another person in the new

her as the new sensei of the league of assassins under the leadership of nyssa raatko ra s al ghul s eldest daughter in battle cassandra sacrifices her life to save former league member tigris from an attack by her own unsuccessful experimental predecessor mad dog shiva decides to resurrect cassandra in a lazarus pit to reveal the truth of her heritage and fight her once more on reviving her shiva admits that the reason she agreed to give birth was that she hoped her child would be the one to kill her in an evenly matched battle cassandra breaks shiva s neck paralyzing her she appears ready to place shiva in the lazarus pit but shiva pleads with her not to do so in response cassandra impales shiva on a hook hanging over the pit apparently killing her although cassandra s intent regarding this action is left ambiguous whether to kill her or let her fall into the pit and be revived it has been confirmed that shiva is alive in one year later cassandra then abandons the identity of

other s life experiences shiva joins oracle s covert team of female operatives known as the birds of prey with canary hoping that spending time with them would soften shiva using the name jade canary 1 shiva remains unchanged however oracle semiseriously refers to shiva as a sociopath and refuses to call shiva by the jade canary title even though shiva as part of the deal with canary has taken to wearing black canary s boots and trademark fishnet stockings though she hates wearing them 14 shiva continues to perform solo work and visits robin to assist him much to robin s chagrin in discovering the truth behind batgirl s recent disappearance and recent upheaval within the league of assassins she refuses to allow herself or oracle s team to be involved and instead trusts her former pupil to handle the situation it appears that she holds no ill will towards cassandra as she informs tim that she hopes that her daughter is well during a recent mission oracle s team confronts the villain prometheus whose helmet allows him to copy the skills of 30 of the world s greatest martial artists including shiva herself this had allowed him a victory against batman in the past shiva believes that his files on her would be out of date and that she would be able to defeat her old self she seems unconcerned about the skills of the other 29 fighters and apparently decides to attack prometheus head on prometheus however has more up to date files than shiva suspected and in three seconds knocks her to the ground after this defeat shiva vanishes leaving a message for black canary tell the canary i release her 15 stripped of her chance to mold black canary in her own image and stripped of sin the young girl who was next in line as her successor shiva is last seen talking to bethany thorne daughter of the late crime doctor it appears that she is yet again hoping to train a new heir in the art of her lethal form of martial arts 15 still although shiva is no longer an active member of the birds of prey she continues to be protective of her former teammates such is the case when the birds of prey are being threatened by spy smasher who attempts to steal control away from oracle after a mission in russia oracle and spy smasher fight against one another for control of the team although oracle is unable to use her legs she is victorious although spy smasher attempts to go back on their deal unfortunately she is confronted outside by every single living birds of prey agent oracle has ever recruited who warn her against ever going after oracle again lady shiva is among them when barbara later asks the others who called shiva no one responds 16 blackest night edit during the events of the blackest night shiva tracks down renee montoya the new question and tells her she intends to test her in battle the two women begin their duel only to be interrupted when victor sage now a reanimated black lantern arrives on the scene and attacks them using his new supernatural abilities sage effortlessly defeats shiva and tries to kill her by tearing out her heart however shiva realizes that the black lanterns feed on human emotion and cuts herself off from all feeling through the use of meditation rendering her invisible to sage after the others on the scene do the same victor angrily departs 17 brightest day edit during the events of the brightest day crossover a new martial artist known as the white canary comes to gotham and sets a plan into motion to ruin black canary s life by framing her for the murder of a european terrorist when black canary first encounters the white canary she muses that the villain may be shiva in disguise 18 but later white canary pits black canary against lady shiva in an honor bound match to the death after breaking black canary s wrist thereby making sure she would be killed both parties accept because white canary dangles the life of sin black canary s adopted daughter as her bait however the huntress challenges shiva instead and even manages to knock her down to everyone s surprise even after receiving many blows the death match is stopped when black canary rescues sin herself and points out a technicality they need not continue the battle to the death immediately and can pick it up at any time in the future the new 52 edit in the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe lady shiva appears in

surprised to see that she remembers him from their first encounter and even more so when she praises his progress since their last meeting she repeats that he s squandering his natural talent by not learning from her shiva completes her mission by throwing an axe at the s e c building door to intimidate into initiating lockdown but quickly realises that nightwing was already injured before their fight to dick grayson s surprise she says that him fighting at a disadvantage shows more than he knows and that he has too much skill to kill without a concrete reason it is later revealed that

and was created by writer john broome and artist carmine infantino 2 throughout the first several years of the character s existence captain boomerang spoke with an american accent beginning in the late 1980s he developed an australian accent owen mercer first appeared in identity crisis 2 2004 and was created by brad meltzer and rags morales fictional character biographies edit george digger harkness edit george digger harkness s debut as captain boomerang on the cover of flash 117 dec 1960 secretly the illegitimate son of an american soldier and an australian woman harkness was raised in an australian town called korumburra in poverty during which time he developed great skill in making boomerangs and in using them as weapons as a young adult he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was unbeknownst to him owned by his biological father it was at this time that he developed the captain boomerang persona that he would continue to use in his later criminal career 3 audiences ridiculed him and a resentful harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime when he began committing crimes he threw suspicion off himself by briefly pretending another man was impersonating him showing his parents really other crooks to the flash after the flash caught him next to a crime scene he nearly succeeded in killing the flash after knocking him out with a boomerang then tying him to a giant boomerang that he fired which then got sent into space and then fell into the ocean however the flash was able to escape from his friction proof bonds by quickly vibrating his molecules he also increased the boomerang s velocity so much he was able to use it to defeat and jail harkness and the two crooks he became a recurring enemy of the flash typically by devising altered boomerangs which could produce astonishing effects some would explode others had razor sharp edges etc and using them ruthlessly he became a staple member of the rogues a group of villains dedicated to opposing flash and who were first organized after gorilla grodd broke them out of jail though captured when flash made their weapons hit each other they continued to act together 4 later on harkness became a less than effective member of the suicide squad in exchange for being pardoned for his crimes 4 however captain boomerang s grating personality and blatant racism among other things he constantly referred to black team member bronze tiger as an abo caused considerable friction among his teammates and he was considered to be a dangerous vicious cowardly and undependable member of the team dysfunctional even by the squad s standards and the equivalent of a class clown amanda waller the squad s commanding officer characterized captain boomerang as a jerk and a screw up this was not an undeserved reputation as among other things harkness simply watched as his teammate mindboggler was shot in the back even while he could have easily saved her mindboggler had earlier used her mind manipulating abilities on harkness to shut him up when he was verbally abusing another team member he also manipulated another team member slipknot into running away from the action just to see if the explosive bracelets the squad members wore really did activate if the wearer attempted to escape unfortunately for slipknot they did he was scared to learn ifrit an artificial intelligence used by the rival team the onslaught had been created based upon mindboggler s thought patterns and revealed what had happened while in the squad harkness also briefly took up the mantle of mirror master to commit robberies 4 however this career was cut short when he was caught and brought to waller who put an end to it by tricking him into a fake assault scene where he was forced to change constantly between mirror master and captain boomerang she rescinded the benefits harkness had been given such as his apartment in new orleans and his status as a voluntary member of the squad many times digger would have to be tricked into battle but when faced with enemies he proved more than competent in upholding his end of the fight harkness also would play a few undercover roles for the squad convincingly managing to be other slimy criminal types later digger would try a simple series of pranks for amusement hitting various members of the squad with pies for a time suspicion had been diverted from him because he had used his skills to pie himself seemingly being hit by the assailant from behind a wall when the squad confronted digger as the culprit he lost his temper and shouted that they could not really punish him since he was already in prison and in the suicide squad he asked waller what are you going to do about it fat lady waller dropped him from a helicopter onto a deserted island due to various events mainly waller breaking many rules by having a criminal gang ruthlessly gunned down the squad broke up for a year when waller was approached again because she was needed she reformed the team and had digger picked up he was at the time trying to construct a massive boomerang to take him back to the mainland harkness revealed a deep patriotism for his home country of australia though his countrymen do not care at all for him and a tremendous fear of being laughed at teammate deadshot commented he often wished he had killed harkness most notably after his drinking led them to miss a plane and to deadshot losing his uniform and entering a depressive phase because of it ironically when boomerang pulled strings to have the suit restored to deadshot lawton s psyche had passed into a phase that led him to loathe it harkness remained with the squad until it was disbanded after a successful mission in diabloverde however despite being a somewhat trusted employee harkness still was quite amoral and greedy selling out adam cray the atom for half a million dollars digger later showed up in superboy with another squad while on a mission to destroy an underwater criminal hideout he was shot through the hands by deadshot and apparently fell to his death he later appeared in the pages of flash with cybernetic hands alongside four other rogues they were given a chance by fellow rogue abra kadabra to become much more than they ever were unfortunately for captain boomerang captain cold mirror master weather wizard and heat wave kadabra s promise of glory was actually a ruse to free neron and empower himself neron then resurrects the five rogues superpowering them and sending them on a bloody rampage that destroys much of flash s hometown and kills thousands eventually the flash and linda park free the rogues the dead are restored to life after being restored to life boomerang and the rogues along with the trickster sought out an artifact that would protect them from neron should he ever take an interest in them again the trickster accompanied them to help an old ex girlfriend recover her kidnapped son in the end the trickster found the boy who turned out to not only be the prophesied agent of a god but also the trickster s son he was also able to convince neron to leave the rogues alone with the rogues either coming away darker from their experiences or seeking enlightenment like heat wave who retired with the monks captain boomerang is also involved with the joker last laugh event after having suffered a mishap with one of his exploding boomerangs digger is transferred by ambulance to keystone city en route the ambulance is attacked by a jokerized deadshot who decides to lend his old pal a hand by injecting him with joker s serum the serum s healing factor revives digger who is cured of his massive full body burns and ready to attack the flash at iron heights prison however once there he is choked unconscious by a jokerized pied piper captain boomerang was killed in the identity crisis miniseries by jack drake father of tim drake digger had been sent by the real killer to attack jack drake only the killer double crossed digger and sent drake a warning and a pistol to defend himself the killer later defended the action by saying that boomerang was hired because he was such an incompetent that jack would only need to pull the trigger and he would be safe digger managed to kill drake but not before he was shot himself 5 digger was later temporarily revived by agent james jesse the former trickster during the rogue war storyline when jesse used unspecified technology to temporarily revive boomerang in an attempt to find out information about the rogues current hideout however jesse was called away due to the latest attack by the rogues before harkness s revival meaning that the only person present when harkness was briefly reanimated was ashley zolomon the estranged wife of hunter zolomon a former reverse flash who had been brought in based on her expertise in dealing with rogues during his brief return to life harkness asked ashley to tell his son that he loved him and warn him never to reveal his mother s real name out of fear that the rogues would kill him in the blackest night crossover his remains are reanimated as a member of the black lantern corps and he joins the reanimated jack and janet drake john and mary grayson tony zucco and the original batman s deceased rogues gallery members in an attempt to take the life of the current batman and red robin they are met with interference from deadman who had possessed the body of etrigan the demon their attack is ultimately called off when batman and red robin cryogenically freeze themselves leaving no emotions for the black lanterns to target 6 harkness later joins other reanimated members of the rogues to target their still living members 7 however the battle results in a draw on both side harkness son owen arrives and takes him away from the battle believing he can bring his father back 8 digger convinces his son that he needs to feed upon the living in order to live so owen lures people such as newcomer villain sandblast to a pit at a construction site where digger is waiting the rogues track owen down captain cold berating him on how foolish he is to believe digger s lies when they discover the remains of a family nearby captain cold reminds owen that the rogues don t kill women or children he shoves owen into the pit where digger rips out his son s heart a black ring then flies down to make owen a black lantern the black lantern harkness and his son are then encased in ice by captain cold 9 digger manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and rejuvenated he appears confused as to what is going on before being knocked out by the flash 10 during the brightest day prologue digger is seen locked in his iron heights cell 11 digger is visited by tim drake whose father harkness murdered 12 tim tells him if he tries to escape he will hunt him down personally 13 he is later given a message from captain cold saying that if he wants to be one of the rogues again he has to prove it by escaping from prison on his own 14 after being beaten by guards digger is being seen to in the medical bay when he suddenly finds himself able to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact while not understanding where this new power came from digger uses it to escape iron heights and attacks the renegades while they are trying to apprehend the flash for murdering mirror monarch shortly after he finds himself confronting a wounded flash 15 george digger harkness as captain boomerang on the cover of the flash vol 3 7 jan 2011 art by francis manapul captain boomerang is at one point contacted by the entity who instructs him to throw a boomerang at dawn granger 16 after seeing the vision his powers go out of control causing him to attack everyone including his fellow rogues 17 afterwards captain boomerang sneaks into iron heights where professor zoom is locked up boomerang releases him in hopes that zoom might help him better understand his version of the entity s message however professor zoom refused to answer and escaped as digger was confronted by the rogues 18 captain cold beats up digger for freeing professor zoom then digger explains to him the importance of the entity s message 19 later captain boomerang is contacted once again by the entity who tells him that he must complete his task prompting digger to travel to star city forest which by now is surrounded by a white barrier while there captain boomerang discovers that he is the only one who can enter the forest 20 within the forest captain boomerang finds dawn and throws a boomerang at her hawk however fails to catch the boomerang and instead the boomerang is caught by deadman who ended up dying in the process and hawk is left to knock captain boomerang unconscious after the entity proclaims captain boomerang has completed his task and his life is restored to him the entity reveals to them that the boomerang was part of a plan to free hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the lords of chaos his act of saving dawn would have broken the hold the lords of chaos have on hawk and allow hank

the son he never raised owen mercer before harkness s death the two bonded taking up his father s legacy he became the second captain boomerang captain cold brother to golden glider who was believed to be owen s mother took owen in as one of the rogues 27 though owen initially had no real attachment to the rogues and even voiced various albeit short opinions out loud he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father s body had been stolen for use in a lab which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from harkness around this time the rogue war storyline began in which the reformed rogues fought the rogues under captain cold ashley zolomon is told by harkness himself he is briefly revived by the reformed rogues as part of an experiment that golden glider is not owen s real mother later it is revealed in flash 225 january 2006 that meloni thawne is the mother of owen harkness formerly owen mercer the new captain boomerang having conceived him by the original boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th century it is unknown whether she gave birth to bart allen or owen first or how owen made it back to our own time during the 2005 2006 infinite crisis storyline owen was part of alexander luthor jr s group of villains he captain cold and mirror master were sent to guard a factory against the outsiders under the command of deathstroke who was actually arsenal in disguise when the ensuing battle between outsiders and rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory the rogues and other villains would not help in the fight at all and then at the explosion he is saved by the outsiders while the rogues left them at the base to blow up he is then turned over to the authorities off panel during the 52 series owen is part of a suicide squad sent by amanda waller to attack black adam in the 2006 one year later storyline owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as iron heights there he finds himself being the cellmate of black lightning who was arrested for a murder that deathstroke the terminator committed 4 it is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of black lightning s identity and are planning to murder him the outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break pierce out of jail unfortunately it goes terribly wrong as they escape black lightning asks that they take owen with them which they grudgingly agree as they escape the outsiders jet the pequod is shot down and while the team escapes the world believes them dead because of this event and the freedom of power treaty the team now works covertly most of the current outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world his history as a rogue has been exploited several times by team leader nightwing from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned jay garrick however it is revealed that his desire to join the outsiders comes from his desire for a family nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because arsenal felt he would be worthy and because owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the rogue war owen searched out the current robin because of their connection where their fathers killed one another while robin originally believed owen was searching for him in order to finish the fight his father started in robin 152 owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero and has offered his assistance to help robin destroy a bomb created by the joker the two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains afterward robin gained a bit of civil respect for boomerang despite what their fathers did to one another boomerang attempted to shake hands with robin but robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step at some point during his tenure with the outsiders captain cold approached the mercenary deathstroke with an offer concerning owen in exchange for kidnapping deathstroke s daughter rose who had betrayed her father and joined the teen titans and delivering her to her father deathstroke would track down the outsiders and turn owen over to the rogues the villains planned to force owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind controlling agent that deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as batman s partner cassandra cain however this plan fell apart when rose escaped and helped the teen titans defeat the rogues which led to deathstroke backing out of the deal 28 owen has also developed a close friendship with supergirl kara zor el 4 after supergirl returned from her time away with power girl kara began looking to start a normal life on earth and went out a date with owen during which they spoke of their past problems kara has nicknamed owen boomer although the pair often flirts with one another they have never progressed to a romantic relationship this comes primarily from the fact that kara continues to show interest in nightwing and jokingly says that what she and owen has is more of a brother sister relationship in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his little sis feeling rejected after kara s relationship with power boy owen goes to a bar where he meets cassandra cain batgirl who at the time was being mind controlled by deathstroke the terminator and who had been hired to kill supergirl cassandra kidnaps and tortures owen to lure supergirl unfortunately this proves unnecessary as kara had tracked down cassandra on her own without any knowledge of owen s kidnapping batgirl nearly manages to defeat supergirl but is defeated when kara grows krypton sunstones which impale her foe kara then rushes owen to the hospital where he is treated while still in medical care it is discovered that power boy has been stalking kara following kara s rather violent break up with power boy the earth was overtaken by spirits from the phantom zone which began to emerge from within superman kara managed to defeat the phantoms and return the earth to normal afterwards in supergirl 19 kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth amongst them boomer to whom she apologises for letting him get hurt and leading him on during this conversation the matter of owen s relationship with kara is finally clarified when asked by kara how he feels about her leading him on owen replies well if i may for me to have been led on would presume i thought i had a shot with you for me to think i had a shot with a sixteen year old girl

glossaries meteorology climate change tornado terms tropical cyclone terms weather portalvte a heat wave or heatwave 1 is a period of excessively hot weather which may be accompanied by high humidity especially in oceanic climate countries while definitions vary 2 a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual climate in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be called a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area 3 the term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot weather which may occur only once a century severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures thousands of deaths from hyperthermia increased risk of wildfires in areas with drought and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning a heat wave is considered extreme weather and poses danger to human health because heat and sunlight overwhelm the human body s cooling system heat waves can usually be detected using forecasting instruments so that a warning can be issued according to the ipcc heatwaves have become more frequent and over land more intense almost everywhere since the 1950s due to climate change 4 heatwaves often have complex effects on human economies due to less productivity of workers disruption of agricultural and industrial processes and damage to infrastructure not adapted for extreme heat 5 6 recent projections suggest heatwaves alone will cause 1 decrease of gdp to

definition based on frich et al s heat wave duration index is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5 c 9 f the normal period being 1961 1990 10 a formal peer reviewed definition from the glossary of meteorology is 11 a period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather to be a heat wave such a period should last at least one day but conventionally it lasts from several days to several weeks in 1900 a t burrows more rigidly defined a hot wave as a spell of three or more days on each of which the maximum shade temperature reaches or exceeds 90 f 32 2 c more realistically the comfort criteria for any one region are dependent upon the normal conditions of that area robert decourcy ward the world meteorological organization defines a heat wave as five or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5 c 9 f or more 12 temperature anomalies march to may 2007 in the netherlands a heat wave is defined as a period of at least five consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in de bilt exceeds 25 c 77 f provided that on at least three days in this period the maximum temperature in de bilt exceeds 30 c 86 f this definition of a heat wave is also used in belgium and luxembourg in denmark a national heat wave hedebølge is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days of which period the average maximum temperature across more than fifty percent of the country exceeds 28 c 82 4 f the danish meteorological institute further defines a warmth wave varmebølge when the same criteria are met for a 25 c 77 0 f temperature 13 while in sweden a heat wave is defined as at least five days in a row with a daily high exceeding 25 c 77 0 f 14 in the united states definitions also vary by region usually meaning a period of at least two or more days of excessively hot weather 15 in the northeast a heat wave is typically defined as three consecutive days where the temperature reaches or exceeds 90 f 32 2 c but not always as this ties in with humidity levels to determine a heat index threshold 16 the same does not apply to drier climates a heat storm is a californian term for an extended heat wave citation needed heat storms occur when the temperature reaches 100 f 37 8 c for three or more consecutive days over a wide area tens of thousands of square miles citation needed the national weather service issues heat advisories and excessive heat warnings when unusual periods of hot weather are expected in adelaide south australia a heat wave is defined as five consecutive days at or above 35 c 95 f or three consecutive days at or over 40 c 104 f 17 the australian bureau of meteorology defines a heat wave as three days or more of maximum and minimum temperatures that are unusual for the location 18 until the introduction of this new pilot heatwave forecast there was no national definition that described heatwave or measures of heatwave severity 18 in greece according to the hellenic national metereological service a heat wave is defined as three consecutive days at or above 39 c 102 f and a minimum temperature in the same period at or over 26 c 79 f with no winds or with weak winds and the above conditions being observed in a broad area in the united kingdom the met office operates a heat health watch system which places each local authority region into one of four levels heatwave conditions are defined by the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rising above the threshold for a particular region the length of time spent above that threshold determines the particular level level 1 is normal summer conditions level 2 is reached when there is a 60 or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night level 3 is triggered when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night and there is a 90 or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels each of the first three levels is associated with a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services and level 4 is associated with more widespread response 19 animation showing heat waves from 1901 to 2010 a more general indicator that allows comparing heat waves in different regions of the world characterized by different climates was published in 2015 20 this was used to estimate heat waves occurrence at the global scale from 1901 to 2010 finding a substantial and sharp increase in the number of affected areas in the last two decades 21 formation edit high pressure in the upper atmosphere traps heat near the ground forming a heat waveheat waves form when high pressure aloft from 10 000 25 000 feet 3 000 7 600 metres strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks 22 this is common in summer in both northern and southern hemispheres as the jet stream follows the sun on the equator side of the jet stream in the upper layers of the atmosphere is the high pressure area summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter as a result this upper level high pressure also moves slowly under high pressure the air subsides sinks toward the surface warming and drying adiabatically inhibiting convection and preventing the formation of clouds reduction of clouds increases shortwave radiation reaching the surface a low pressure at the surface leads to surface wind from lower latitudes that brings warm air enhancing the warming alternatively the surface winds could blow from the hot continental interior towards the coastal zone leading to heat waves there or from a high elevation towards low elevation enhancing the subsidence and therefore the adiabatic warming 23 24 in the eastern united states a heat wave can occur when a high pressure system originating in the gulf of mexico becomes stationary just off the atlantic seaboard typically known as a bermuda high hot humid air masses form over the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea while hot dry air masses form over the desert southwest and northern mexico the sw winds on the back side of the high continue to pump hot humid gulf air northeastward resulting in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the eastern states 25 in the western cape province of south africa a heat wave can occur when a low pressure offshore and high pressure inland air combine to form a bergwind the air warms as it descends from the karoo interior and the temperature will rise about 10 c from the interior to the coast humidities are usually very low and the temperatures can be over 40 c in summer the highest official temperatures recorded in south africa 51 5 c was recorded one summer during a bergwind occurring along the eastern cape coastline 26 27 the role of soil moisture can also contribute to the intensification of heat waves in europe 28 29 low soil moisture leads to a number of complex feedback mechanisms which can in turn result in increased surface temperatures one of the main mechanisms is reduced evaporative cooling of the atmosphere 28 when water evaporates it consumes energy and thus will lower the surrounding temperature if the soil is very dry then incoming radiation from the sun will warm the air with little or no cooling effect from moisture evaporating from the soil climate change edit main article effects of climate change heat waves and temperature extremes heatwaves over land have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s due to climate change in almost all world regions furthermore heat waves are more likely to occur simultaneously with droughts marine heatwaves have also increased in frequency with a doubling since 1980 4 the intensity of individual heat waves can often be attributed to global warming some extreme events would have been nearly impossible without human influence on the climate system a heatwave that would occur once every ten years before global warming started now occurs 2 8 times as often under further warming heatwaves are set to become more frequent an event that would occur each ten year would occur every other year if global warming reaches 2 c 30 map of increasing heatwave trends frequency and cumulative intensity over the midlatitudes and europe july august 1979 2020 31 heat waves and droughts as a result minimize ecosystem carbon uptake 32 carbon uptake is also known as carbon sequestration extreme heat wave events are predicted to happen with increased global warming which puts stress on ecosystems 32 stress on ecosystems due to future intensified heat waves will reduce biological productivity 32 this will cause changes in the ecosystem s carbon cycle feedback because there will be less vegetation to hold the carbon from the atmosphere which will only contribute more to atmospheric warming 32 policy makers funders and researchers responding to the increasing heatwaves created the extreme heat resilience alliance coalition under the atlantic council to advocate for naming heatwaves measuring them and ranking them to build better awareness of their impacts 33 34 examples edit main article list of heat waves june 2019 was the hottest month on record worldwide the effects of this were especially prominent in europe 35 increased wildfires in places such as spain can also be attributed to heat waves 36 in july 2019 over 50 million people in the united states were present in a jurisdiction with any type of heat advisory scientists predicted that in the days following the issuance of these warnings many records for highest low temperatures will be broken i e the lowest temperature in a 24 hour period will be higher than any low temperature measured before 37 illustration of urban heat exposure via a temperature distribution map blue shows cool temperatures red warm and white hot areas the 2021 western north america heat wave resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region including 49 6 c 121 3 f the highest temperature ever measured in canada 38 a study that investigated 13 115 cities found that extreme heat exposure of a wet bulb globe temperature above 30 c tripled between 1983 and 2016 it increased by 50 when the population growth in these cities is not taken into account urban areas and living spaces are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas partly due to the urban heat island effect the researchers compiled a comprehensive inventory of past urban extreme heat events 39 40 according to estimates of a 2022 study by the climate research group first street foundation 107 million people in the us will experience extremely dangerous heat in the year 2053 41

shown in the table above is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature hyperthermia also known as heat stroke becomes commonplace during periods of sustained high temperature and humidity older adults very young children and those who are sick or overweight are at a higher risk for heat related illness the chronically ill and elderly are often taking prescription medications e g diuretics anticholinergics antipsychotics and antihypertensives that interfere with the body s ability to dissipate heat 42 heat edema presents as a transient swelling of the hands feet and ankles and is generally secondary to increased aldosterone secretion which enhances water retention when combined with peripheral vasodilation and venous stasis the excess fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the extremities the heat edema usually resolves within several days after the patient becomes acclimated to the warmer environment no treatment is required although wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema heat rash also known as prickly heat is a maculopapular rash accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts the sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture producing small pruritic vesicles on an erythematous base heat rash affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing if this continues for a duration of time it can lead to the development of chronic dermatitis or a secondary bacterial infection prevention is the best therapy it is also advised to wear loose fitting clothing in the heat once heat rash has developed the initial treatment involves the application of chlorhexidine lotion to remove any desquamated skin the associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines if infection occurs a regimen of antibiotics is required the 1936 north american heat wave record temperatures were based on 112 year records heat cramps are painful often severe involuntary spasms of the large muscle groups used in strenuous exercise heat cramps tend to occur after intense exertion they usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non electrolyte containing water this is believed to lead to hyponatremia that induces cramping in stressed muscles rehydration with salt containing fluids provides rapid relief patients with mild cramps can be given oral 2 salt solutions while those with severe cramps require iv isotonic fluids the many sport drinks on the market are a good source of electrolytes and are readily accessible heat syncope is related to heat exposure that produces orthostatic hypotension this hypotension can precipitate a near syncopal episode heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating which leads to dehydration followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced venous blood return in the face of decreased vasomotor control management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using oral rehydration therapy sport drinks or isotonic iv fluids people who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time they should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee bending movements can help promote venous blood return heat exhaustion is considered by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke hyperthermia it may even resemble heat stroke with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion symptoms may include diarrhea headache nausea and vomiting dizziness tachycardia malaise and myalgia definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids most patients will require fluid replacement with iv isotonic fluids at first the salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known after discharge from the hospital patients are instructed to rest drink plenty of fluids for 2 3 hours and avoid the heat for several days if this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke one public health measure taken during heat waves is the setting up of air conditioned public cooling centers mortality edit

july 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in the united states between 1992 and 2001 deaths from excessive heat in the united states numbered 2 190 compared with 880 deaths from floods and 150 from hurricanes 43 the average annual number of fatalities directly attributed to heat in the united states is about 400 44 federal data from 2020 estimates more than 1300 people die in the united states every year as a result of extreme heat 45 the 1995 chicago heat wave one of the worst in us history led to approximately 739 heat related deaths over a period of 5 days 46 eric klinenberg has noted that in the united states the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined including lightning rain floods hurricanes and tornadoes 47 48 despite the dangers scott sheridan professor of geography at kent state university found that less than half of people 65 and older abide by heat emergency recommendations such as drinking plenty of water in his study of heat wave behavior focusing particularly on seniors in philadelphia phoenix toronto and dayton ohio he found that people over 65 don t consider themselves seniors one of his older respondents said heat doesn t bother me much but i worry about my neighbors 49 according to the agency for health care research and quality about 6 200 americans are hospitalized each summer due to excessive heat and those at highest risk are poor uninsured or elderly 50 more than 70 000 europeans died as a result of the 2003 european heat wave 51 also more than 2 000 people died in karachi pakistan in june 2015 due to a severe heat wave with temperatures as high as 49 c 120 f 52 53 the concern now is focusing on predicting the future likelihood of heat waves and their severity additionally due to the fact that in most of the world most of those suffering the impacts of a heat wave will be inside a building this will modify the temperatures they are exposed to and as a result there is the need to link climate models to building models this means producing example time series of future weather 54 55 other work has shown that future mortality due to heat waves could be reduced if buildings were better designed to modify the internal climate or if the occupants were better educated about the issues so they can take action in time 56 57 underreporting and displacement edit the number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to a lack of reports and misreports 44 when factoring in heat related illnesses actual death tolls linked to extreme heat may be six times as high as official figures as suggested for california 58 and japan 59 part of the mortality observed during a heat wave can be attributed to short term forward mortality displacement it has been observed that for some heat waves there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave such compensatory reductions in mortality suggest that heat affects especially those so ill that they would have died in the short term anyway 60 another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk as shown by the deadly french heat wave in 2003 heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors 61 social invisibility is one such factor in places where heat related deaths often occur indoors among elderly people living alone it can be challenging to assign heat as a contributing factor 62 psychological and sociological effects edit in addition to physical stress excessive heat causes psychological stress to a degree which affects performance and is also associated with an increase in violent crime 63 high temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level in every society crime rates go up when temperatures go up particularly violent crimes such as assault murder and rape furthermore in politically unstable countries high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars 64 additionally high temperatures have a significant effect on income a study of counties in the united states found that economic productivity of individual days declines by about 1 7 for each degree celsius above 15 c 59 f 65 surface ozone air pollution edit further information ozone ozone air pollution and ozone low level ozone in urban areasozone pollution in urban areas is especially concerning with increasing temperatures raising heat related mortality during heat waves 66 during heat waves in urban areas ground level ozone pollution can be 20 higher than usual 67 one study concluded that from 1860 to 2000 the global population weighted fine particle concentrations increased by 5 and near surface ozone concentrations by 2 due to climate change 68 an investigation to assess the joint mortality effects of ozone and heat during the european heat waves in 2003 concluded that these appear to be additive 69 leaf scorching edit main article effects of climate change on agriculture this

contribute to bushfires and wildfires during the disastrous heat wave that struck europe in 2003 fires raged through portugal destroying over 3 010 square kilometres 1 160 sq mi or 301 000 hectares 740 000 acres of forest and 440 square kilometres 170 sq mi or 44 000 hectares 110 000 acres of agricultural land and causing an estimated 1 billion worth of damage 71 high end farmlands have irrigation systems to back up crops with heat waves cause wildfires floods edit heat waves can also contribute to severe flooding the record breaking heat wave that afflicted pakistan beginning in may 2022 led to glacier melt and moisture flow which were factors in the devastating floods that began in june and claimed over 1 100 lives 72 infrastructural damage edit heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt 73 water lines to burst and power transformers to detonate causing fires heat waves can also damage rail roads such as buckling and kinking rails which can lead to slower traffic delays and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains power outages edit heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use which can create power outages exacerbating the problem during the 2006 north american heat wave thousands of homes and businesses went without power especially in california in los angeles electrical transformers failed leaving thousands without power for as long as five days 74 the 2009 south eastern australia heat wave caused the city of melbourne australia to experience some

bye bye johnny thunder nobody missed him 3 carmine infantino according to amash and nolen weathington 2010 black canary is really carmine infantino s first character 3 according to the artist when kanigher gave me the script i said how do you want me to draw her he said what s your fantasy of a good looking girl that s what i want isn t that a great line so that s what i did i made her strong in character and sexy in form the funny part is that years later while in korea on a national cartoonists trip i met a dancer who was the exact image of the black canary and i went out with her for three years bob didn t ask me for a character sketch for the black canary he had a lot of respect for me i must say that he always trusted my work bob loved my black canary design 3 dinah drake edit main article black canary dinah drake at her golden age debut the black canary was the alter ego of dinah drake and participated in crime fighting adventures with her love interest and eventual husband gotham city detective larry lance 4 initially the character was a hand to hand fighter without superpowers who often posed as a criminal to infiltrate criminal gangs later stories depicted her as a world class martial artist with a superpower the canary cry a high powered sonic scream which could shatter objects and incapacitate and even kill powerful foes when dc comics adjusted its continuity the black canary was established as two separate entities mother and daughter dinah drake lance and dinah laurel lance stories since the silver age focused on the younger black canary ascribing her superhuman abilities to a genetic mutation dinah laurel lance edit main article black canary dinah laurel lance following the universe altering events of crisis on infinite earths concluding in march 1986 the black canary s history was revised again the mind transplant story of 1983 was discarded in this version of the story the present day black canary is dinah laurel lance who inherits the identity from her mother dinah drake lance although some references for example those in james robinson s starman series tried to distinguish between the two canaries by calling the first diana recent accounts have confirmed dinah as the mother s given name the two canaries origin stories were told in full in secret origins vol 2 50 august 1990 in this story dinah drake is trained by her father detective richard drake intending to follow him on the gotham city police force when she is turned down her disillusioned father dies shortly afterwards determined to honor his memory dinah fights crime and corruption by any possible means she becomes a costumed vigilante using her inheritance to open a flower shop as her day job 5 dinah marries her lover private eye larry lance and several years later their daughter dinah laurel lance is born birds of prey 66 june 2004 would establish that they took the name laurel from a librarian dinah befriended during a case 6 new 52 version edit during dc s the new 52 era which began in 2011 black canary was portrayed as a single character with a metahuman canary cry resulting from government experiments on an alien child named ditto this version of black canary founded the birds of prey on her own and led the super team team 7 alongside her husband kurt lance before later becoming lead singer in a rock band called black canary after five years dc later began to row back on controversial new 52 continuity changes with its dc rebirth initiative with the narrator of geoff johns dc rebirth 1 wally west lamenting from outside the universe on how black canary and green arrow hardly know each other anymore when they should be husband and wife as a result of sinister alterations to the timeline the comic shows the pair briefly meeting by chance and then separately staying up at night contemplating what is missing from their lives they meet again in green arrow rebirth 1 and instantly hit it off as part of rebirth black canary also re establishes the traditional birds of prey line up with batgirl and huntress and also joins the justice league of america following subsequent continuity restoring events in doomsday clock and dark nights death metal the current black canary is re established as being the daughter of her golden age predecessor fully reversing the controversial new 52 changes and bringing an end to the distinctive new 52 version of the character 7 the largely erased new 52 versions of the dc heroes were established as residing on earth 52 in the comic book series doomsday clock 8 powers abilities and equipment edit although depictions of the black canary have varied over the years the character is often portrayed as a prodigious hand to hand combatant having mastered styles such as aikido 9 boxing capoeira hapkido judo 10 11 12 jujutsu kung fu krav maga muay thai shuri te 12 and wing chun 13 she has been trained by other top tier fighters such as wildcat lady

motorcyclist gymnast covert operative and investigator she is also an excellent leader and tactician having served as the field commander of the birds of prey and the leader of the justice league and league of assassins for a time her superpower the canary cry 14 allows her to create ultrasonic vibrations whenever she screams allowing her to severely damage both organic and inorganic objects her canary cry has been depicted as having 10 fold the capabilities of most sonic weapons and has even been depicted as breaking metals and having the resonance to affect and shatter earth 15 in the new 52 her canary cry now grants her the ability to glide and propel herself across long distances by screaming downwards 16 due to this reliance on speech she is often bound and gagged by villains as a means of incapacitation despite her power the black canary often relies on her martial arts skills instead preferring to use her canary cry only during urgent situations such as against superpowered opponents the origin of the black canary s canary cry has been retconned throughout her character history with it being originally depicted as magical in origin due to being cursed by the wizard later the cry is depicted as an inborn metahuman ability briefly during the new 52 era her ability was depicted as resulting from gene splicing experiments using samples from an alien girl named ditto 17

first african american superhero to headline his own series 2 in his earliest stories black lightning is depicted as a schoolteacher from the crime ridden suicide slum area of metropolis who acquires electrical superpowers from a technologically advanced power belt that he puts to use to clean up crime in his neighborhood over time pierce establishes himself as a successful superhero in the dc universe and later stories depict him as having internalized the belt s powers as a result of his latent metagene later retellings of black lightning s origins simplify his story by depicting him as a metahuman with the inborn ability to manipulate and generate electricity the character later goes on to father two superhero daughters thunder and lightning and work closely alongside batman as a founding member of the outsiders superhero team dc originally commissioned isabella to create its first black character following on from isabella s successful work for marvel comics with luke cage however only 11 issues of the series were published before dc ran into financial trouble in 1978 which led them to cut back the majority of their titles this proved to be a blessing in disguise however as the character went on instead to feature prominently in books like justice league of america in dc s new slimmed down offering of titles exposing him to more readers with the character was remembered for promoting critical perspective on established superheroes like batman and superman early elements of the character were controversial and later removed or toned down for example in

goshawk scientific classification kingdom animalia phylum chordata class aves order accipitriformes family accipitridae sharp shinned hawk a small member of the accipitrinae subfamily hawks are birds of prey of the family accipitridae they are widely distributed and are found on all continents except antarctica 1 the subfamily accipitrinae includes goshawks sparrowhawks sharp shinned hawks and others this subfamily are mainly woodland birds with long tails and high visual acuity they hunt by dashing suddenly from a concealed perch 2 in america members of the buteo group are also called hawks this group is called buzzards in other parts of the world generally buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds they are relatively larger winged shorter tailed and fly further distances in open areas than accipiters buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than hunting in a fast horizontal pursuit the terms accipitrine hawk and buteonine hawk are used to distinguish between the types in regions where hawk applies to both the term true hawk is sometimes used for the accipitrine hawks in regions where buzzard is preferred for the buteonine hawks all these groups are members of the family accipitridae which includes the hawks and buzzards as well as kites harriers and eagles to confuse things further some authors use hawk generally for any small to medium accipitrid that is not an eagle 3 a red tailed hawk buteo jamaicensis a member of the buteo group the common names of some birds include the term hawk reflecting traditional usage rather than taxonomy for example some

edit screaming hawk scream of a hawk problems playing this file see media help intelligence edit in february 2005 canadian ornithologist louis lefebvre announced a method of measuring avian iq by measuring their innovation in feeding habits 8 based on this scale hawks were named among the most intelligent birds the hawk is very intelligent towards humans and other hawks 9 eyesight edit hawks like most birds are tetrachromats having four types of colour receptors in the eye these give hawks the ability to perceive not only the visible range but also ultraviolet light other adaptations allow for the detection of polarised light or magnetic fields this is due to the large number of photoreceptors in the retina up to 1 000 000 per square mm in buteo compared to 200 000 in humans a high number of nerves connecting these receptors to the brain and an indented fovea which magnifies the central portion of the visual field 10 11 migration edit like most birds the hawk migrates in the autumn and the spring different types of hawks choose separate times in each season to migrate the autumn migrating season begins in august and ends mid december it has been studied that there are longer migration distances than others the long distance travelers tend to begin in early autumn while the short distance travelers start much later thus the longer the distance the earlier the bird begins its journey there have been studies on the speed and efficiency of the bird s migration that show that it is better for a hawk to arrive at its destination as early as possible 12 this is because the first bird that arrives has the first pick of mates living area food and survival necessities the more fat a bird has when it starts its migration the better chance it has of making the trip safely kerlinger states that studies have shown that a bird has more body fat when it begins its migration before it leaves than when has arrived at its destination 13 one of the most important parts of the hawk s migration is the flight direction because the direction or path the bird chooses to take could greatly affect its migration the force of wind is a variable because it could either throw the bird off course or push it in the right direction depending on the direction of the wind 13 to ensure a safer journey a hawk tries to avoid any large bodies of water in the spring and fall by detouring around a lake or flying along a border 14 hawkwatching is a citizen scientist activity that monitors hawk migration and provides data to the scientific community habitat and distribution edit see also list of falconiformes by population the red tailed hawk is the most common hawk in north america past observations have indicated that while hawks can easily adapt to any surrounding hawks prefer a habitat that is open hawks usually like to live in places like deserts and fields likely as it is easier to find prey as they are able to live anywhere they can be found in mountainous plains and tropical moist areas hawks have been found in places such as central america the west indies and jamaica behavior edit starting in the hawk s early life it is fed by its parents until it leaves the nest 15 the young hawk while still in its fledgling phase will leave its nest as early as six weeks old once the bird is older it begins to hunt the hawk kills its prey with its talons as opposed to other predator birds such as the falcon the falcon uses its talons to catch the prey but kills the small animal with its beak instead of its talons citation needed the hawk s preferred time for hunting is usually just before nightfall when daylight lessens 12 although the hawk is known for being a violent predator some are gentle and quiet citation needed when it flies the hawk flaps its wings rapidly and then uses that momentum to glide smoothly and gracefully through the air 14 the idea of flocking during migration has been closely analyzed and it has been concluded that it is a commutative tool used by birds and other animals to increase survival it has become clear to observers that a hawk traveling in a flock has a greater chance of survival than if it travelled alone another word used in the united states that has the same meaning as flock particularly in terms of groups of hawks is kettle 13 215 16 reproduction edit hawks are known for their unique mating season the method the hawk uses to reproduce is different from most the male and female will fly together in a circular motion once they reach a certain height the male will dive toward the female and then they will raise back to the height again the two birds will repeat this until finally the male latches onto the female and they begin to free fall down to earth in one year a female hawk will lay about five eggs both the male and the female will cater and take care of the eggs for about a month until they hatch 15 the male and the female create their nest before the mating season and improve it together during the nesting season the two birds usually make their nest prior to mating some species of hawks tend to be monogamous and stay with the same mating partner their whole lives 14 diet edit red tailed hawk removing fur from a rodent before eating it mission peak regional preserve california a hawk s diet is predictable and includes a variety of smaller animals some of these small animals include snakes lizards fish mice rabbits squirrels birds and any other type of small game that is found on the ground 15 more specifically a red shouldered hawk likes to eat smaller birds like doves and bugs like grasshoppers and crickets 14 in popular culture edit further information falconry a war hawk or simply hawk is a term used in politics for somebody favoring war the term reportedly originated during the 1810 debates in congress over a possible war with great britain when congressman john randolph called the pro war faction led by henry clay the war hawks 16 numerous sporting clubs such as the atlanta hawks the hawthorn hawks and the malmö redhawks use the bird as an emblem miami university in oxford ohio officially became known as the redhawks in 1997 after formerly being

november 2011 learn how and when to remove this template message a familiar example of a trajectory is the path of a projectile such as a thrown ball or rock in a significantly simplified model the object moves only under the influence of a uniform gravitational force field this can be a good approximation for a rock that is thrown for short distances for example at the surface of the moon in this simple approximation the trajectory takes the shape of a parabola generally when determining trajectories it may be necessary to account for nonuniform gravitational forces and air resistance drag and aerodynamics this is the focus of the discipline of ballistics one of the remarkable achievements of newtonian mechanics was the derivation of kepler s laws of planetary motion in the gravitational field of a point mass or a spherically symmetrical extended mass such as the sun the trajectory of a moving object is a conic section usually an ellipse or a hyperbola a this agrees with the observed orbits of planets comets and artificial spacecraft to a reasonably good approximation although if a comet passes close to the sun then it is also influenced by other forces such as the solar wind and radiation pressure which modify the orbit and cause the comet to eject material into space newton s theory later developed into the branch of theoretical physics known as classical mechanics it employs the mathematics of differential calculus which was also initiated by newton in his youth over the centuries countless scientists have contributed to the development of these two disciplines classical mechanics became a most prominent demonstration of the power of rational thought i e reason in science as well as technology it helps to understand and predict an enormous range of phenomena trajectories are but one example consider a particle of mass m displaystyle m moving in a potential field v displaystyle v physically speaking mass represents inertia and the field v displaystyle v represents external forces of a particular kind known as conservative given v displaystyle v at every relevant position there is a way to infer the associated force that would act at

taken at positions along the trajectory this is the mathematical form of newton s second law of motion force equals mass times acceleration for such situations examples edit uniform gravity neither drag nor wind edit trajectories of a mass thrown at an angle of 70 without drag with stokes drag with newton drag the ideal case of motion of a projectile in a uniform gravitational field in the absence of other forces such as air drag was first investigated by galileo galilei to neglect the action of the atmosphere in shaping a trajectory would have been considered a futile hypothesis by practical minded investigators all through the middle ages in europe nevertheless by anticipating the existence of the vacuum later to be demonstrated on earth by his collaborator evangelista torricelli citation needed galileo was able to initiate the future science of mechanics citation needed in a near vacuum as it turns out for instance on the moon his simplified parabolic trajectory proves essentially correct in the analysis that follows we derive the equation of motion of a projectile as measured from an inertial frame at rest with respect to the ground associated with the frame is a right hand coordinate system with its origin at the point of launch of the projectile the x displaystyle x axis is tangent to the ground and the y displaystyle y axis is perpendicular to it parallel to the gravitational field lines let g displaystyle g be the acceleration of gravity relative to the flat terrain let the initial horizontal speed be v h v cos θ displaystyle v_ h v cos theta

displaystyle v 2 g and the maximum altitude at the maximum range is v 2 4 g displaystyle v 2 4g derivation of the equation of motion edit assume the motion of the projectile is being measured from a free fall frame which happens to be at x y 0 0 at t 0 the equation of motion of the projectile in this frame by the equivalence principle would be y x tan θ displaystyle y x tan theta the co ordinates of this free fall frame with respect to our inertial frame would be y g t 2 2 displaystyle y gt 2 2 that is y g x v h 2 2 displaystyle y g x v_ h 2 2 now translating back to the inertial frame the co ordinates of the projectile becomes y x tan θ g x v h 2 2 displaystyle y x tan theta g x v_ h 2 2 that is y g sec 2 θ 2 v 0 2 x 2 x tan θ displaystyle y g sec 2 theta over 2v_ 0 2 x 2 x tan theta where v0 is the initial velocity θ displaystyle theta is the angle of elevation and g is the acceleration due to gravity range and height edit trajectories of projectiles launched at different elevation angles but the same speed of 10 m s in a vacuum and uniform downward gravity field of 10 m s2 points are at 0 05 s intervals and length of their tails is linearly proportional to their speed t time from launch t time of flight r range and h highest point of trajectory indicated with arrows the range r is the greatest distance the object travels along the x axis in the i sector the initial velocity vi is the speed at which said object is launched from the point of origin the initial angle θi is the angle at which said object is released the g is the respective gravitational pull on the object within a null medium r v i 2 sin 2 θ i g displaystyle r v_ i 2 sin 2 theta _ i over g the height h is the greatest parabolic height said object reaches within its trajectory h v i 2 sin 2 θ i 2

that the sine function is such that there are two solutions for θ displaystyle theta for a given range d h displaystyle d_ h the angle θ displaystyle theta giving the maximum range can be found by considering the derivative or r displaystyle r with respect to θ displaystyle theta and setting it to zero d r d θ 2 v 2 g cos 2 θ 0 displaystyle mathrm d r over mathrm d theta 2v 2 over g cos 2 theta

orbiting objects edit if instead of a uniform downwards gravitational force we consider two bodies orbiting with the mutual gravitation between them we obtain kepler s laws of planetary motion the derivation of these was one of the major works of isaac newton and provided much of the motivation for the development of differential calculus catching balls edit if a projectile such as a baseball or cricket ball travels in a parabolic path with negligible air resistance and if a player is positioned so as to catch it as it descends he sees its angle of elevation increasing continuously throughout its flight the tangent of the angle of elevation is proportional to the time since the ball was sent into the air usually by being struck with a bat even when the ball is really descending near the end of its flight its angle of elevation seen by the player continues to increase the player therefore sees it as if it were ascending vertically at constant speed finding the place from which the ball appears to rise steadily helps the player to position himself correctly to make the catch if he is too close to the batsman who has hit the ball it will appear to rise at an accelerating rate if he is too far from the batsman it will appear to slow rapidly and then to descend for a proof of the above statement see trajectory of a projectile catching balls notes edit it is

professor abel weathers paranoid of an impending nuclear holocaust was attempting to find a way for humanity to survive the fallout through forced evolution one of the test subjects in his experiments was his 16 year old daughter kole whom he grafted with crystal and promethium a fictionalized version of the real world element promethium instead of evolving to survive a nuclear fallout as her father intended kole found herself with the ability to create and control pure silicon crystal at will kole as shown in the new teen titans 9 1985 kole was then kidnapped by the mad sun titaness thia for two years thia forced kole to use her powers to construct a crystal prison in which thia could hold important prisoners thia eventually came into conflict with the teen titans which ultimately led to the death of the goddess and kole winning her freedom lilith a member of the titans with limited precognition sensed the dark clouds of destruction around kole and warned her that she would face a grim future should she return to earth and invited her to remain in olympus kole declined electing to reclaim her life on earth now back on earth kole tried to reunite with her parents only to find that her father s experiments had produced a house full of crystalline and insectoid monstrosities when the titans came to confront him he had them captured and attempted to subject them to the same experiments kole helped them to escape and in the ensuing conflict the lab self destructed abel his wife marilyn and the rest of their test subjects emerged from the wreckage transformed into insect forms which would allow them to survive a nuclear holocaust having nowhere else to go kole chose to go with the titans to new york city though she never officially joined the group she was certainly considered a titan by some members evidenced later in stories such as the secret origins of the teen titans in which dick grayson laments how kole was a titan for such a short time lacking a home of her own kole lived with adeline and joseph wilson as a result of this kole developed an immediate friendship with jericho she was deeply upset when jericho along with a few other titans went on a mission to deep space yet could not accompany jericho with whom she had fallen in love shortly after this in the pages of crisis on infinite earths kole attempted to save the earth 2 robin and earth 2

arkham asylum recreated characters removed from continuity kole or a pre crisis version of her was one of them kole appears as she originally did presumably this character vanished from existence when the psycho pirate s episode of madness ended along with her colleagues she appeared in team titans 8 12 the implication at the time being that she was a ghost of some sort later on in 24 after a year of not appearing she was shown in monarch s lair implying she was one of his puppets and has been removed from continuity years later during the infinite crisis event kole was briefly resurrected and placed under the control of brother blood who forced her to battle the newest incarnation of teen titans she was defeated and returned to the grave along with the other undead titans kole would briefly resurface one year later when kid eternity summoned her from the afterlife to help locate the soul of kid devil s aunt marla after kid devil tells kole that he had read about her in the titans archives and thinks she is cool she expresses gratitude and says she wishes that he could have been a member of the team while she was still alive she then returns to her resting place leaving the two heroes to continue on their own powers and abilities edit kole has the power to spin crystal which is to create silicon crystal into independent masses anything from a crystal sculpture to a safety slide she is known to encase people in crystal effectively immobilizing them it is not clear what happens to the crystal she spins whether it eventually breaks down or remains in existence has never been established she once spun a crystal bridge to transport herself and jericho from manhattan to titans tower in the east river what happened to that bridge is subject to debate kole also has the ability to fly but it is unclear whether this also comes from the experiments that gave her powers or granted to her during her tenure as thia s slave later in the teen titans comics kole is seen transporting herself on a crystal carpet only once has kole been seen moving through crystal or at least the crystal she spun herself 1 alternate versions edit earth one edit in teen titans earth one

jackal golden jackal canis aureus scientific classification kingdom animalia phylum chordata class mammalia order carnivora suborder caniformia family canidae subfamily caninae tribe canini subtribe canina species referred to as jackals lupulella adusta lupulella mesomelas canis aureus jackals are medium sized canids native to africa and eurasia while the word jackal has historically been used for many canines of the subtribe canina in modern use it most commonly refers to three species the closely related black backed jackal lupulella mesomelas and side striped jackal lupulella adusta of sub saharan africa and the golden jackal canis aureus of south central europe and asia the african golden wolf canis lupaster was also formerly considered as a jackal while they do not form a monophyletic clade all jackals are opportunistic omnivores predators of small to medium sized animals and proficient scavengers their long legs and curved canine teeth are adapted for hunting small mammals birds and reptiles and their large feet and fused leg bones give them a physique well suited for long distance running capable of maintaining speeds of 16 km h 10 mph for extended periods of time jackals are crepuscular most active at dawn and dusk their most common social unit is a monogamous pair which defends its territory from other pairs by vigorously chasing intruding rivals and marking landmarks around the territory with their urine and feces the territory may be large enough to hold some young adults which stay with their parents until they establish their own territories jackals may occasionally assemble in small packs for example to scavenge a carcass but they normally hunt either alone or in pairs contents 1 etymology 2 taxonomy and relationships 3 species 4 folklore and literature 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links etymology edit the english word jackal dates back to 1600 and derives from the french chacal from turkish çakal derived from the persian شغال shoghāl which is in turn derived from the sanskrit श ग ल śṛgāla meaning the howler 1 2 taxonomy and relationships edit the extant wolf like canids dog gray wolf coyote golden wolf golden jackal ethiopian wolf dhole african wild dog side striped jackal black backed jackal phylogenetic relationships between the extant wolf like clade of canids based on mitochondrial dna 3 4 similarities between jackals and coyotes led lorenz oken in the third volume of his lehrbuch der naturgeschichte 1815 to place these species into a new separate genus thos named after the classical greek word θώς jackal but his theory had little immediate impact on taxonomy at the time angel cabrera in his 1932 monograph on the mammals of morocco questioned whether or not the presence of a cingulum on the upper molars of the jackals and its corresponding absence in the rest of canis could justify a subdivision of that genus in practice cabrera chose the undivided genus alternative and referred to the jackals as canis instead of thos 5 oken s thos theory was revived in 1914 by edmund heller who embraced the separate genus theory heller s names and the designations he gave to various jackal species and subspecies live on in current taxonomy although the genus has been changed from thos to canis 5 the wolf like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because they all have 78 chromosomes the group includes genus canis cuon and lycaon the members are the dog c lupus familiaris gray wolf c lupus coyote c latrans golden jackal c aureus ethiopian wolf c simensis black backed jackal c mesomelas side striped jackal c adustus dhole cuon alpinus and african wild dog lycaon pictus 6 the latest recognized member is the african wolf c lupaster which was once thought to be an african branch of the golden jackal 4 as they possess 78 chromosomes all members of the genus canis are karyologically indistinguishable from each other and from the dhole and the african hunting dog 7 8 the two african jackals are shown to be the most basal members of this clade indicating the clade s origin from africa 3 canis arnensis arrived in mediterranean europe 1 9 million years ago and is probably the ancestor of modern jackals 9 the paraphyletic nature of canis with respect to lycaon and cuon has led to suggestions that the two african jackals should be assigned to different genera schaeffia for the side striped jackal and lupulella for the black backed jackal 10 11 or lupulella for both 11 12 the intermediate size and shape of the ethiopian wolf has at times led it to be regarded as a jackal thus it has also been called the red jackal or the simien jackal species edit species binomial authority description range black backed jackallupulella mesomelas schreber 1775 the most lightly built jackal once considered to be the oldest living member of the genus canis 13 it is now placed in the genus lupulella it is the most aggressive of the jackals being known to attack animal prey many times its own weight and it has more quarrelsome intrapack relationships 14 southern africa and eastern coast of kenya somalia and ethiopia side striped jackallupulella adustus sundevall 1847 it primarily resides in wooded areas unlike other jackal species it is the least aggressive of the jackals rarely preying on large mammals 15 central and southern africa golden jackalcanis aureus linnaeus 1758 the largest and most widespread of the jackals it is more closely related to wolves than to african jackal species southeastern europe middle east western asia and south asia folklore and literature edit like foxes and coyotes jackals are often depicted as clever sorcerers in the myths and legends of their regions they are mentioned roughly 14 times in the bible it is frequently used as a literary device to illustrate desolation loneliness and abandonment with reference to its habit of living in the ruins of former cities and other areas abandoned by humans it is called wild dog in several translations of the bible in the king james bible isaiah 13 21 refers to doleful creatures which some commentators suggest are either jackals or hyenas 16 in the indian panchatantra stories the jackal is mentioned as wily and wise 17 in bengali tantrik tradition they represent the goddess kali it is said she appears as jackals when meat is offered to her the serer religion and creation myth posits jackals were among the first animals created by roog the supreme deity of the serer people 18 references edit jackal the american heritage

represented chaos while dove represented order his brother don hall died during crisis on infinite earths and was replaced with dawn granger 2 armageddon 2001 monarch edit main article monarch comics monarch was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak dystopian earth fifty years in the future the people were unhappy with his rule particularly a scientist named matthew ryder an expert on temporal studies who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power he learned that forty years ago one of earth s strongest and most powerful heroes would eventually turn evil and become monarch and ten years from that event he would conquer the world during a time travel experiment matthew was transformed into a being called waverider and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become monarch not knowing that monarch was following him when monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day he killed dove and her enraged partner killed him for it removing the villain s mask hank discovered that he was monarch and donned the armor 2 the reveal of hank hall as monarch led to some controversy amongst the fan community monarch was originally intended to be revealed as captain atom with clues in the story pointing towards this which had to be discarded when it was changed at the last minute this change was due to the premature leaking of monarch s identity while monarch was always supposed to be captain atom this was supposed to be a secret when monarch s identity was prematurely leaked dc decided to preserve the surprise of the story by switching monarch s identity to that of hank hall as many fans pointed out hawk and dove vol 3 annual 2 had hank hall fighting monarch face to face in 2001 with hawk being the destroyer of monarch 3 dove allowed waverider to see a multitude of futures and realize hawk is monarch armageddon the alien agenda edit when hostile aliens encounter monarch and captain atom in the past sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago they attempt to enlist both with each figure having no knowledge of the other involved to assist them in creating a wormhole the wormhole s creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive earth existed but would allow the aliens to travel freely zero hour extant edit main article zero hour comics hank hall as extant during zero hour art by eric battle shortly after returning to the present monarch confronted waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him it is explained at this point that when monarch killed dove her powers went directly into hawk realising this monarch unleashes his hidden powers and becomes extant 4 extant then removes waverider s timetravel device and joins forces with renegade green lantern hal jordan now known as parallax in a plan to alter time as they saw fit 2 his first act was to alter the future so that he could have a metahuman army at his disposal mostly consisting of members of the teen titans his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself several armies of heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future down but not out extant began to strike back at the heroes at ground zero the beginning of time parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault and extant hit the atom with a chronal blast de aging him into a teenager sensing defeat was imminent he escaped the fight promising vengeance at a later date extant would first reappear in the 1999 one shot impulse bart saves the universe 5 in it extant picks a fight with the original justice society as a means of tricking the linear men into saving the life of an innocent bystander who was destined to die the man they saved would now go on to develop a nuclear weapon that when tested would shift the earth out of its proper orbit causing massive changes in the timelines of some of earth s greatest heroes among these changes hal jordan never becomes green lantern thus he never becomes parallax and never stops extant from destroying all of time fortunately for the citizens of time impulse arrives and is barely able to defeat extant and prevent the linear men from saving the doomed scientist he would engage the justice society again on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality warping power of the worlogog recently dismantled by hourman because he feared its power although extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of metron s stolen mobius chair doctor fate learned from the imprisoned mordru that when hourman had dismantled the worlogog he had retained a small fragment of it thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime worlogog that the jsa could exploit after the resurrected dove sacrificed herself to distract extant hourman divided his hour of power amongst his teammates thus granting them all immunity to extant s reality warping powers for four minutes each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the worlogog following this setback extant again attempted to escape instead extant was teleported by hourman and metron at atom smasher s behest into the seat of an airplane whose crash kobra had caused earlier in his relative timestream as a result of this atom smasher s mother was saved as she was on the plane when it crashed but atom smasher replaced his mother with a weakened extant saving her life but murdering the super villain to stop his threat and ensure that the same number of people died on that plane who had died originally hawk restored edit in response to fan criticism of armageddon 2001 many of whose readers felt that the character of hawk had been severely misused in the story s last minute changes dc comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended a hero dc had already retconned extant s portion of hank hall s timeline in issue 14 of jsa dated september 2000 in which metron announced his intention to erase the villain s wretched timeline with his mobius chair this was the second issue of a 3 part story entitled the hunt for extant the details of which are listed above after this dc also retconned monarch s portion of hall s timeline with the final issue of the 6 part miniseries the battle for blüdhaven dated september 2006 which now depicted captain atom s

known the entity tells them that they must protect the forest and withstand the ultimate savior which is alec holland 19 it was revealed that captain boomerang s mission for throwing the boomerang was to free hawk as an avatar of war from the lords of chaos because his act of saving dove would have broken their hold on him to be his own self however he failed to catch the boomerang and instead it was caught by boston brand who ended up dying in the process and used his final act to move his white power ring to alec holland and bring back the swamp thing in order to cleanse the green of nekron

dated one of her team members don hall dove before leaving him to begin a relationship with the caveman gnarrk prior to the disbanding of the original teen titans and their titans west counterpart group lilith revealed that she had a vision of her teammate donna troy wonder girl marrying a red headed man who is horrifically murdered along with their child at the time donna was dating her teammate and red head roy harper fearing lilith s prophecy donna broke up with roy lilith rejoined the team following a reunion with her teammates for the wedding of donna troy and terry long who lilith s prophecy ended up actually referencing she mentioned that something terrible had happened to gnarrk who was not with her at the wedding but would not elaborate she soon began to be stalked by a mysterious winged creature called azrael who sought to make her his mate however every time he came near lilith she glowed with a previously unseen power her fellow titans blamed azrael for hurting her and attacked him every chance they got after revealing to her teammates that she had similar heat attacks long before azrael appeared she resigned from the titans in anger during the terror of trigon storyline the new teen titans vol 2 1 6 lilith returned to the team as she had become secretly possessed by azar and sought to get the titans to help tracking down raven who had gone missing during this adventure the possessed lilith arranged the merger of the souls of the residents of azarath in a successful attempt to cleanse raven of evil lilith rejoined the team following this adventure but after azrael returned lilith began manifesting flame like powers this was enough to alert lilith s birth mother thia of her daughter s location thia kidnapped lilith and revealed the

thia who had launched a brutal assault on olympus and those who followed the greek gods during the battle thia s brother and husband hyperion sacrificed his life to kill thia afterward lilith was offered demigod status by zeus and a place on olympus which she accepted post crisis edit after the crisis on infinite earths lilith was not heard from for a time however the mythological titans including thia showed up in the new titans 50 54 as a benevolent pantheon and adoptive parents of donna troy this storyline effectively negated lilith s origin 3 lilith s first post crisis appearance was a flashback story published in the new titans 56 which detailed the original titans first encounter with gnarrk her first proper appearance was in the war of the gods storyline allying with the titans and providing help for them during the crossover omen edit the character would disappear again until 1996 with the launch of dan jurgens teen titans at the start of the series jurgens had a masked figure named omen gather the team for mr jupiter who once again was financially backing the teen titans the character was originally intended to be raven but an embargo was placed upon the cast of the new teen titans appearing in the title by editorial as such lilith was substituted as the secret identity of omen in teen titans vol 2 12 15 omen is unmasked as lilith after being captured by the super villain haze during the story lilith summons both the founding titans save donna troy who was imprisoned by dark angel at the time and the jurgens titans to rescue her the original titans recognized haze as a villain they fought once before in the past but when haze unmasked omen before the two teams and shattered the illusion spell omen used to hide her identity she was revealed as lilith lilith was revealed to be mr jupiter s illegitimate daughter and haze mr jupiter s son from a previous marriage mr jupiter wife had run off with their son jarrod haze and years later loren jupiter met lilith s mother 4 haze blamed lilith for his father abandoning him and his mother to poverty and sought to use her as a pawn to destroy their father and the titans haze was defeated and lilith remained with the group for the rest of its run as omen lilith now possessed telekinetic power and illusion casting powers it was also established that like her brother lilith suffers from mental illness due to her not being able to tune out other peoples thoughts lilith periodically suffers from episodes of amnesia and disassociation from her sense of self she aided the titans in protecting former team mate cyborg s soul from the justice league in the jla titans the technis imperative mini series shortly after that lilith was abducted by vandal savage who wanted her to divine a perfect team to take down the titans savage forced lilith to submit but she purposely chose members who wouldn t work well as a team she was rescued by the reformed titans 5 lilith stood with her old friends when a mysterious corporation called optitron approached the titans and young justice with an offer to fund the two groups before they could discuss the offer the teams were attacked by an

and pierce donna troy s heart and while donna was revealed to still be alive on another world lilith was killed this tragedy told in titans young justice graduation day led team leader nightwing to disband the two groups although they would be reformed shortly thereafter as the outsiders and the latest incarnation of the teen titans lilith appeared in teen titans vol 3 30 as her soul was

destroyed by a burst of white light emanating from dawn granger 10 lilith was recently seen in a flashback of donna troy s during their early years donna and roy harper were dating and apparently roy had intended to propose to donna but lilith informed donna of a prophecy in which a red haired man who loved donna and became her husband would die thinking the prophecy meant roy donna rejected the proposal lilith s prophecy however turned out to be true in regards to donna s now deceased husband terry the new 52 edit in this new timeline a passing reference to lilith is first introduced in red hood and the outlaws as being part of a team with cyborg garth a k a aqualad richard garfield and a new unseen character named dustin as superhero companions that starfire seemingly no longer remembers 11 between her being mentioned in red hood and the outlaws 1 and titans hunt 1 dc introduced a character named omen that skitter referred to as lilith omen was a telepath that worked for harvest and n o w h e r e and in particular the bloodsport event known as the culling where teen captives of n o w h e r e were forced to fight to the death omen was blonde and had her eyes sewn shut she could create illusions with her psychic powers and control peoples thoughts this made her a valuable member of n o w h e r e as she enforced harvest s will amongst his henchmen and prisoners conditioning and preparing them for the culling omen reappears in teen titans vol 4 annual 3 she appears reformed and her eyes are no longer sewn shut harvest tries absorbing her powers as well as those of the other colony s metahumans into a single weapon only for the titans to defeat him by blowing up the colony sparing lilith and all the other metahumans present with titans hunt restoring

karen beecher hank hall and the caveman hero gnarrk it is revealed that along with lilith the heroes were the original teen titans the group fell victim to the villain mr twister who ensnarled them into an occult ritual that threatened the world the only way to stop the ritual involved erasing all memories the group had of their existence and of each other which was performed by lilith when mr twister resurfaced and restored their memories lilith began attempting to gather the titans together to stop their enemy once and for all 12 lilith clay goes by the name omen in the dc rebirth comics she was in the team called titans which is composed of former teen titans members who are now grown up with nightwing donna troy arsenal tempest and the wally west version of flash when the speed force restores the titan s memories of wally west it is shown that wally and lilith used to be in a romantic relationship 13 lilith left to pursue a relationship while the team disband shortly

shown to use pyrokinesis teleport maintain complex illusions and project psionic power blasts it is also strongly implied that she recalls the world before crisis on infinite earths a trait she

described as an alpha class psionic and has demonstrated mental powers that easily rival if not surpass those of the villainous telepath psimon her powers often manifest as a visible green aura of light that outlines her sphere of influence she has displayed a breadth of psychic abilities including mind reading psionic cloaking precognition projecting psychic attacks and psionic blasts as well as enough telekinetic precision to create an invisible layer of armor around herself during her time as a member of k n o w h e r e she would torture prisoners by creating terrifying illusions and

batman it was batman who first revealed to francine that kirk had mutated himself into the feral man bat at one point batman had captured the man bat and tried to give him an antidote to his condition but the man bat fought him at every turn he even tried bringing francine to the batcave in the hopes that she could convince langstrom to take the antidote willingly kirk escaped however and when he next reunited with francine forced her to take the same bat gland extract that he had taken as proof of her love and devotion to him although francine was terrified she knew that somewhere within the man bat s insanity lay the soul of the man she loved francine took the serum and like kirk mutated into a creature with bat like qualities the two man bats decided to marry one another at their wedding they donned latex masks to disguise their features but batman interrupted the ceremony and exposed them in front of all their guests batman fought against francine and kirk and was finally able to defeat them by using the cathedral s bells to incapacitate them upon doing so batman administered his cure to both of them turning them back to normal a few months later the langstroms traveled to las vegas nevada to study a rare breed of vampire bat that had surfaced following underground nuclear tests in new mexico while examining one of the bats francine pricked her finger on a fang and the toxin activated the dormant man bat gene that still resided in her body she transformed into a monster once again but this time with more vampiric characteristics including enhanced strength in this iteration francine could only transform into a she bat during the nights of the full moon an uncontrollable savage francine began terrorizing the streets of las vegas biting victims upon the neck and drinking their blood when news of her rampage reached gotham city batman believed that it was kirk langstrom who had become the man bat he flew out to vegas and fought the she bat on the roof of a vegas casino after the initial fight batman deduced that his opponent was not kirk langstrom at all but francine finding kirk the two tracked francine to a cave where batman ensnared her with his batrope he then administered the same antidote he had used in the past and francine was once again cured this treatment did not last long however a year later a professor of medieval history from antioke university known as baron tyme used his sorcery to take control of francine turning her back into the she bat he had francine attack and kill a former colleague of his named professor raymond arthur kirk langstrom became the man bat again and used hypnosis to break baron tyme s hold over her kirk defeated tyme and the sorcerer apparently died in his tower chamber when the room caught on fire batman consulted with langstrom about his wife s condition and insisted that he give francine a full blood transfusion kirk brought francine to his home town of chicago where she lived with him at the lakeshore manor apartments he kept a steady vigil over her condition and fortunately for them both the blood transfusion appeared to have cured her the langstroms had two children rebecca and aaron while rebecca was a normal human excluding the times when her whole family was mutated into man bats aaron was born a mutant bat creature due to the serum in his parents systems she also served as the lead scientist for the outsiders to help them with their missions in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe francine langstrom is reimagined as a more villainous character in this new timeline she met kirk as a research assistant and supposedly loved him for his conviction in developing the man bat serum for curing deafness when kirk transformed into the man bat to help cure the city of the man bat epidemic she decided to bring kirk back so he could perfect the formula for its original purpose then she would take the formula herself and transform into the she bat with some reported deaths kirk began to think that he lacked control over the beast but he discovered that francine s man bat formula differentiated from his as the bat she used was a south american vampire bat it is revealed that francine only married kirk to ensure the company that he would complete the serum and then have him killed so she could inherit a large sum of money she developed her own serum after kirk turned into the man bat in order to keep her job kirk tried to help cure her but she preferred her new form and attacked kirk but ultimately refused to kill him kirk combined the two serums in order to become a stronger beast and defeat francine and francine mocked him by acknowledging that he could only beat her by becoming like her she is later charged for the murders that she committed as the she bat 20 she is later released from arkham by the penguin and sent to attack harley quinn demonstrating that she has much better control over her transformation than kirk does she injects the man bat formula into harley and her friend tony to turn them into man bats however harley ultimately regains control over herself after francine threatens harley s friends and defeats

luthor smallville edit lillian portrayed by alisen down had a long and prolific role in the tv series smallville lillian came from a wealthy family how she met lionel is unclear but they were married sometime before the 1980s by all accounts lillian was a caring beautiful and sophisticated person as well as comments made by lex and lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality had ambitions of her own and often stood up to lionel eventually lillian began to wonder about the special projects that lionel had she searched for answers and found something called veritas however alexander saw her going through his father s briefcase so lillian asked him not to tell anyone when lionel found out he immediately blamed alexander and forced him to tell the truth when alexander did lillian insisted lionel explain what veritas was but lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again lillian felt angered and disgusted by alexander s betrayal sometime later lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life lionel hired a nurse named rachel dunleavy to assist her rachel and lionel subsequently had an affair resulting in the birth of lionel s illegitimate son lucas it is unclear whether lillian knew of the affair or the child lillian was helped by a nanny pamela jenkins who alexander regarded as a second mother lionel was often absent from home and lillian insisted that he take alexander on one of his business trips to smallville during the meteor shower of 1989 lionel s resulting shame and constant critique of alexander bothered lillian greatly sometime in the early 1990s lionel insisted that they have another child an idea that lillian was highly opposed to presumably because of her poor health however when alexander was 11 lillian became pregnant again she insisted that alexander be allowed to come home for school from excelsior academy and lionel complied her pregnancy was strenuous and lillian was bedridden for much of it on alexander s disastrous 12th birthday which no one attended lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of st george which he kept into adulthood and later gave to clark kent after baby julian s birth lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually one evening lionel sent the baby s nanny home and insisted that lillian bond with the child lillian expressed her concern that lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce a threat that she had apparently made many times and that lionel had called tiresome on returning home from work one night lionel discovered alexander in the baby s nursery alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing julian while trying to stop him from crying lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck alexander their relationship never recovered even after he became an adult it was not until years later after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories that he remembered that lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions hoping to spare him from lionel s maltreatment alexander took the blame correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife sometime before her death lillian along with lex and lionel went to a ranch in montana to spend time together during that time a snake spooked lillian s horse prompting lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better after julian s death lillian s health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when alexander was 13 he later confessed to clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her lex also told lana lang that he was away at boarding school when lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school lillian left her shares of luthorcorp to her son and pamela lillian s death was

showed lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from lionel and luthorcorp however at the end of the vision lana his dream wife suffered complications during childbirth because of lex s lack of resources and estrangement from his father he was unable to transfer lana to a better facility and she died this led lex to believe that lana died because he lacked enough money and power with these everything else in life could be secured as a result lex ignored his mother s warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption after realizing this lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son s choice when lex was injected with the limbo drug which placed its users in a state of clinical death he met lillian again who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice when lex was shot and went into a coma clark kent and lionel used a machine that allowed clark to enter lex s mind in order to find lois lane and kara kent in lex s mind clark met a young version of lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult lex in the memory featuring lillian snooping in lionel s briefcase clark witnessed lionel s verbal and physical abuse of both lex and lillian as well as watched lex try to help his mother up but lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away

century burgundian army is a typical example this consisted of a contingent of foreriders from whom a forward detachment of scouts was drawn the main body of the vanguard accompanied by civil officials and trumpeters to carry messages and summon enemy towns and castles to surrender and a body of workmen under the direction of the master of artillery whose job it was to clear obstacles which would obstruct the baggage and artillery travelling with the main army 2 in an english force of the period the foreriders of the vanguard would be accompanied by the harbingers whose job was to locate lodgings for the army for the following night 3 forward detachments edit during world war ii the red army began forming ad hoc vanguard formations called forward detachments peredovye otriady from army corps and divisional units forward detachments brought together the mobile motorized or mechanized elements of the parent formation to play an exploitation role once a breakthrough of the german lines occurred a rifle division for example might mount one or two battalions of infantry on trucks with motorized antitank guns and motorized artillery in support 4 see also edit vanguardism

see kator below draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with lana lang who had eyes only for superboy much to draper s resentment 78 as an adult draper underwent a self imposed self improvement regimen including exercise and cosmetic surgery to overcome his physical shortcomings he became an expert locksmith and architect designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called mount olympus impressed by the achievement superman augmented the prison s security by placing it on an antigravity platform initially dubbed draper s island by superman it was informally renamed superman island by the adult lana with whom draper remained smitten just as she remained lovestruck by superman it was the latter name plus the novelty of the floating platform that caught public attention diverting recognition from draper himself this proved the final straw for draper who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the master jailer 79 he attacked superman and kidnapped lana under that name superman defeated him and he was sent to his own prison 80 in the new adventures of superboy 17 may 1981 at

superman escaped the trap draper became obsessed with proving that he could capture the real thing note this version of draper was dressed in casual wear only getting an updated costume with chain based attacks later draper made several other attempts to capture superman often programming the deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere on one occasion in superman the man of steel 43 april 1995 he programmed deathtrap to appear during a draper security press conference and display how draper s devices were being subverted thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company in action comics 739 superman in his blue energy form was captured in an energy hobble by deathtrap now calling himself the locksmith at the end of the story it was revealed to the reader that his daughter carla draper was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this the now costumed master jailer was one of the villains along with

connections to the league of assassins the first incarnation richard drakunovski was created by dennis o neil and james r berry in the novel kung fu master richard dragon dragon s fists 1974 under the pseudonym jim dennis 1 o neil later adapted the character for dc comics in the comic book richard dragon kung fu fighter 2 a thief who was trained in martial arts and decided to use his skills for good the character is considered one of dc comic s premier martial artist in the dc universe alongside peers such as bronze tiger and lady shiva 3 in more recent continiitues the character himself is

the green arrow villain ricardo diaz jr raised as son of a kingpin the character would be prompted the seek revenge after witnessing green arrow kill his father eventually finding the league of assassins he was mentored by richard drakunvoski in martial arts but rejected his more peaceful philosophies and killed his master before adopting his moniker 4 the ricardo diaz appeared in the

character biography edit richard drakunovski edit as a teenage sneak thief in japan young richard dragon broke into a dojo outside of kyoto to steal a priceless jade buddha before he could get away dragon was caught and beaten by the dojo s teenage student ben turner 2 o sensei the dojo s master saw something worth nurturing in richard and for the next seven years taught ben and richard side by side mastery of the martial arts richard came to find an inner peace only using his skill when absolutely necessary once he felt there was nothing more he could teach them the o sensei left the two turner and dragon were recruited by barney ling head of the law keeping espionage agency known as g o o d global organization of organized defense to join the organization together ben and richard would defeat the corrupt businessman guano cravat foiling his plans to instigate a war for his own benefit ben and richard founded a martial arts dojo in manhattan and richard would go on to battle international threats such as telegram sam the preying mantis the league of assassins and his former superior barney ling thirsty for revenge cravat would arrange for the murder of carolyn wu san one of o sensei s god daughters aided by barney ling cravat tricked carolyn s sister sandra wu san into believing dragon was the murderer consumed with a need for revenge sandra trained to the peak of human capability mastering martial arts to defeat dragon when the two masters finally met in battle however dragon was able to show sandra that cravat had deceived her without dragon s death as a goal sandra no longer had a need for her martial arts mastery sensing she needed guidance dragon helped her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts ultimately deciding that she was sandra no more she rechristened herself shiva she fought crime with dragon and ben turner until the three parted ways turner brainwashed by the villainous sensei of the league of assassins became the renegade bronze tiger dragon decided to retire devoting himself to teaching others lady shiva became one of the world s greatest assassins richard as he appeared in the question after the character s title was canceled dragon became a supporting character in the 1980s series the question the title character of that book vic sage was a masked crime fighter based in hub city who came into conflict with lady shiva after all but killing the question shiva sent him to see richard dragon for training 2 sage s stubborn streak made him near impossible for most people to teach however when he met dragon he found himself reluctant to challenge his new sensei because dragon was in a wheelchair richard trained the question both in martial arts and eastern philosophy forcing him to question his world view and let go of much of his anger of note he loosely quoted zhuangzi s story the butterfly dream later richard would start referring to his student as butterfly because of this richard said that shiva had saved sage because she saw a passion for combat in him while richard on the other hand thought that sage s passion was for curiosity regardless richard realized that for sage to have a spiritual awakening he had to first let go of the self destructive behaviors that hub city brought out in him thus richard sent sage back home as he left sage met shiva again and the two briefly sparred she explained that this fight had been for her to test her own perceptions she thought she had seen a warrior s passion in him that was lacking skills and felt that she had been proved correct since he faced her a second time knowing she had destroyed him the first shiva concluded that she had been right about him and richard wrong but sage proposed that maybe he had just been curious what would happen if they fought again which would make richard right sage adopted the identity of the question again futilely trying to save the city just as sage s doomed efforts to save hub city threatened to destroy him dragon arrived to advise his student dragon finally convinced sage that his crusade to save hub city was no longer doing anything but destroying him when sage collapsed from exhaustion and his injuries richard revealed that he was capable of using his legs perfectly and put sage in the wheelchair dragon had realized he would need the chair to make sage let down his defences sage was so full of macho that he would never have listened to him otherwise 5 the chair had not been just a charade however richard revealed that he had allowed himself to be handicapped as part of his own learning process going on to state i was a teacher then i am about to become something else so i discard that option the city had truly degenerated by this point with all pretense of law and order long lost richard who had thought his studies had put him beyond such things found himself shocked and horrified by the actions of people in hub city for example a man was using a dead baby to try and beg for milk money when richard and the others uncovered this he tossed the body into a nearby trash can 6 dragon wordlessly met lady shiva who had arrived on the outskirts of hub city in the helicopter that was to take sage and dragon away she wished to go toward and enjoy the chaos that sage and richard were rejecting shiva uses force and threats to ensure the pilot would do what she wishes 7 dragon as sensei to barbara gordon richard would next appear as sensei to oracle helping her to see past her own wheelchair related limitations 2 dragon spends months training her in escrima the philippine art of stick fighting a martial art she could use despite her wheelchair dragon as sensei to helena bertinelli not long after that the masked heroine the huntress became the main suspect in a series of murders realizing that her headstrong nature would likely mean her death this time the question saved her from her many pursuers including the police and batman and took her to richard dragon seeing many similarities between her and the question dragon helped teach the adventuress to control her anger and slow down after huntress joined the birds of prey richard dragon aided her in fighting the twelve brothers in silk an asian martial arts squad that provided protection to a major heroin distributor in 2004 the title was revived and the character revamped by chuck dixon

tournament she is watching she chides him for not being able to live up to the powerful name of dragon shiva becomes dragon s lover and instructor and the series touches on their now strained relationship the series begins with the tiger locating dragon who is seeking death by fighting in death matches he agrees to help dragon resolve his problems with shiva if he agrees to stop killing in tracking shiva they are confronted by nightwing and the new green arrow connor hawke nightwing alludes to dragon training him as dragon trained bruce wayne who passed that training on to nightwing at the end of the series dragon and shiva are pitted in combat dragon gains the upper hand in the fight and as he begins to deliver his death blow shiva s devout followers rush to save her knocking dragon away unhappy at this disturbance shiva attacks and possibly kills her followers before returning to kill dragon with her signature move the leopard claw dragon is however resurrected by the demonic neron who wants dragon to kill shiva dragon refuses and walks away from neron saying that both had held up their parts of the agreement richard dragon appears starting in week 26 of the comic book 52 in the mystic city of nanda parbat where he starts to train former gotham detective renee montoya 2 his appearance matches that of the richard dragon seen before the dixon reboot albeit with a full head of long hair as when training question and oracle rather than balding when training huntress in this story dragon makes references to a conversation he had with the question in the question series contradicting at least some of chuck dixon s richard dragon series the 52 series is also where richard s former student vic sage dies from cancer 8 in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe

he s also trained dick grayson batman and connor hawke although they appeated in the 2004 series given hat the version of richard dragon seen in 52 appeared to be the version seen prior to the 2004 retcon the canonical nature of these students is unclear in the new 52 the green arrow villain who takes the name richard dragon ricardo diaz jr is revealed to have killed the original man by that name who had been his sensei explaining the original richard dragon s absence from the new 52 9 skills and abilities edit richard drakunovski edit the first richard dragon possesses no inherent superhuman abilities being a master martial artist whose skills enable him to make others believe he possesses superhuman capabilities dragon is proficient in all manner of both conventional weaponry

pencak silat and arnis 4 14 15 16 he is also a master of philosophy specifically as it concerns a heroic lifestyle and he has guided those such as the huntress and wonder woman in the past as to the correct path they need to follow he also possesses the mystical talisman known as the dragon s claw the totem being capable of mystically collecting and direct his own qi at times of great duress it

richard dragon similarly possesses no superhuman abilities but is an accomplished martial artist having been taught by his predecessor in all aspects of martial arts diaz s fighting style differs from his mentor s as he is capable of analyzing his opponents to find weaknesses and can estimate a person s physical characteristics i e height weight etc he can accurately predict his opponent s next

rebirth edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it june 2017 in dc rebirth caitlin snow is taken to belle reve penitentiary where she is introduced to the suicide squad and offered a place on the team by amanda waller she accepts and joins the team she helps the suicide squad in their fight against the justice league but subsequently assists them against maxwell lord when he is possessed by eclipso whose attempt to tap into her darkest desire only unlocks her desire to make a difference she then has to save all the suicide squad and the justice league by absorbing the energy out of superman and using it against lord afterwards waller is forced to release snow into batman s custody 20 she then joined the new justice league of america made up of batman the atom lobo black canary vixen and the ray powers and abilities edit all versions have shown the ability to absorb heat from external sources and transmute it into waves of cold using these powers killer frost can create an ice sheen across her entire body that grants her increased durability cause intense blizzards that can instantly freeze the target and generate objects composed completely of ice such as projectiles in the form of ice shards and defensive walls or shields she can also instantly freeze animate matter through physical contact and is unable to touch a normal person without freezing them although she is able to kiss people who can can cool her down and negate her cryo kinetic abilities like firestorm her weakness is the need to absorb external heat sources to generate ice although heat based weapons such as flamethrowers only make her stronger she can be imprisoned in cold surroundings such as being locked in a refrigeration truck or buried under a mountain of snow the caitlin snow version of killer frost is constantly plagued by a hunger for heat which can only be sated by absorbing the heat from a living being a process which inevitably kills the victim however in recent stories she seems to have finally gotten it under control by only absorbing a tiny amount of heat from every person she touches sparing them and leaving them otherwise unharmed the caitlin snow and louise lincoln versions of the character have albeit inconsistently demonstrated the ability to fly either by riding arctic winds or through an unknown manner of self propulsion while the exact limits of her abilities have yet to be established how much power frost can channel at once seems to depend on how much heat she has absorbed and stored in her body for example when she absorbed all the heat from superman whose body is supercharged by yellow solar energy during a stand off between the justice league and the suicide squad she was able to flash freeze the entire league in a single blast it also seems that using up all the heat energy she has stored can put frost s life in danger if she does not feed in time she even risks dying of starvation the caitlin snow version also boasts a genius level intellect being s t a r labs youngest and brightest scientist prior to her transformation she could solve complex equations easily operate heavy energy generating machinery and appeared particularly skilled in the field of physics and research about energy she once managed to create an ice prism with her powers that converted superman s heat vision into a bright burst of sunlight to defeat eclipso several adaptations of the villain have also depicted the crystal frost and louise lincoln incarnations as having basic skills in melee combat which they use in conjunction with their powers as well as impressive agility being able to perform maneuvers such as leaps or cartwheels with ease other versions edit dc super friends edit killer frost appeared in the dc super friends comic

the thawnes and told the allens that barry was the surviving twin while the other twin had been stillborn 30 malcolm s parents hugo and charlene were con artists passing off a healing salve that was actually used to cover the thawnes natural super abilities because of his clean cut looks and demeanor malcolm was most often used to lure the unsuspecting victims as an adult he was in central city

amazing zoo crew grodd travels to earth c in an attempt to conquer but is defeated by the efforts of the zoo crew plus changeling of the teen titans 9 in the 1991 angel and the ape limited series

america wedding special gorilla grodd is among the villains seen as members of the injustice league unlimited during the final night grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the heart of darkness normally effective only in eclipses that brought out the inner beast of humans turning the population of the town of leesburg into feral monsters including supergirl however supergirl was eventually able to fight off grodd s influence allowing her to oppose grodd until the sun was restored grodd is assumed killed when an icicle fell into him one of grodd s widest ranging schemes was to arrange solovar s assassination and manipulate gorilla city into war against humanity with the aid of a shadow cabinet of prominent gorillas called simian scarlet in the course of this grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla 10 he has since recovered and a failed attempt to set up a base in florida leads to his capture and incarceration in iron heights grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum he was attacked by a gang known as the vultures one of them commented on how their member iggo had the strength of a gorilla which reminded grodd of his true form suddenly changing back to his original shape and size he quickly defeated the gang making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his telepathic abilities reading the minds of the crooks he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the flash and a plan began to form in his mind grodd found another space rock identical to the one that had given him his powers and contacted hector hammond a human who had also gained similar powers grodd was able to take control of gorilla city after increasing his evolutionary abilities but was defeated once more grodd is also seen in the superman batman arc public enemies controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down superman and batman for the prize of one billion dollars offered by then u s president lex luthor despite his use of foes such as mongul solomon grundy lady shiva and nightshade batman is able to deduce the mind behind the attacks and they quickly dispose of grodd 11 he is responsible for hunter zolomon s crippling resulting in the man s transformation into the villainous zoom after trying to change the event to never have happened hunter would often think about how grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking this over with the flash 12 in birds of prey grodd makes a deal with grimm to get blockbuster an ape heart 13 in the jla classified story arc grodd and his forces attack the ultramarine corps grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed he personally eats some of the humans during the course of this incident beryl informs the team that grodd ranks number three on the latest global most wanted 14 in the salvation run mini series grodd teams up with the joker to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains 15 he kills monsieur mallah and the brain and was knocked off a cliff by the joker 16 he is seen alive and attempting to deliver payback to the joker 17 in justice league of america grodd is shown among the members of libra s new secret society and placed in the inner circle 18 in the final crisis storyline gorilla grodd was among the high ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into justifiers 19 he is sent to apprehend snapper carr and cheetah but fails 20 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe before flash makes earthfall into the super ape s midst grodd ii was crown prince of gorilla city speaking with his father king grodd about how the light that touched their fair city was destiny destiny which had once again tilted its hand and brought their culture to being but grodd rebuffs these claims stating their destiny was their own to command and that they were destined for dominance 21 the flash barry allen first encounters gorilla grodd after a trip through the speed force which strands him in their hidden community all of which just shortly after grodd has been newly crowned as gorilla king after killing his father and consuming his mind 22 the flash is hailed as a messenger spoken of in gorilla prophecy by all but grodd who sees the interloper as a threat to his ascension and designs for world conquest when told of the treachery planned by the ape elders from his most trusted general grodd led a personal execution detail in an attempt to kill barry and assume the mantle of the light bringer but the flash foils grodd s attempts by outmaneuvering him until king grodd causes the caves containing gorilla cities history to collapse upon himself knocking him unconscious allowing the flash to escape 23 after having been unearthed by general silverback while still buried beneath the rubble of the ruined cave grodd eventually recuperated after his previous battle with flash he found that he still had some followers among the ape army and would eventually slaughter most of the elders saving one needed for his invasion plans 24 grodd returns and attacks central city with an army of gorilla soldiers searching for payback against the messenger 25 after a while of waiting out the battle gorilla grodd would make his way to one of dr darwin elias s labs which contain canisters of flash s excess speed energy 26 consuming these batteries temporarily supercharges grodd s own speed force evolved physiology enabling him enough speed and power to overwhelm the flash nearly killing him 27 during the forever evil storyline gorilla grodd returns to central city during a ceremony commemorating flash between the humans and gorillas at the time when ultraman had caused an eclipse gorilla grodd brandishing several new powers courtesy of the light proceeds to take control of central city as its king and renames it grodd city 28 eventually growing bored with this grodd uses his heightened abilities to take off the rest of his apes following him to parts unknown dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 grodd is the one who founded the terrorist organization called the black hole and he is using technology that could contain the power of the speed force in addition he also mind controlled fast track into operating as negative flash 29 30 since he is defeated by the flash with his plans of controlling the speed force foiled he has been recruited by lex luthor who promised him incredible power to paralyze people s movements called the still force which was released due to the shattering of the source wall 31 it also enabled him to act as a guardian of turtle 32 powers and abilities edit grodd s psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control and transfer his consciousness into other bodies grodd also has on occasion vast telekinetic abilities ranging from force beams telekinetic transmutation of matter and lifting thousands of tons mentally in recent issues he has shown the ability to absorb intelligence through the consumption of human brains he possesses great superhuman strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla he is a scientific genius who has mastered gorilla city s advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own he also uses large laser guns 4 33 his thought process still operates at a relatively human speed the flashes have shown some degree of immunity to his telepathic illusions by moving so fast that their thoughts process grodd s illusions in slow motion in one story grodd either gains or strengthens his already vast psychokinetic abilities via ingesting a pill he develops after evolving himself into a human enabling him to control the forces of nature but after he turns back he loses this power as his brain is not evolved enough in later stories however grodd has been seen using both his psionic attributes openly without the need of accelerated evolution in the new 52 reboot of dc continuity grodd like all the super apes of gorilla city gained their powers from the light the gorillas identifying term for flash s speed force the very embodiment of which represents relative space and time being of noble blood king grodd is tougher stronger quicker and far more physically and mentally dynamic than other members of his evolved species he boasts enhanced gorilla strength enough to easily rend flesh from bone pick up and or smash cars and injure flash through his speed aura being durable enough to resist supersonic punches from the flash rip his way out of barbed wire unharmed and even survive impacts from a charging mammoth affected by the speed force 24 34 he has sharp enough reflexes to keep up with even the most nimble meta humans with relative ease as he was able to grasp at flash more than once while he was running having intercepted many of his high speed attacks more than once another facet to his physiology is that he along with other apes like him can assimilate both the knowledge and powers of enemies who they kill by devouring their brains a process dubbed by their forefathers as cerecorbis this process increases grodd s intelligence bestowing him with a super genius iq on top of whatever memories his vanquished enemies had as well as any abilities they might have possessed 35 via direct ingestion of the light s energies he gains enhanced speed and further augmented dynamism enabling him to not just effortlessly keep up with but outright overpower flash in a straightforward fight although this augmentation was short lived as the speed force batteries he drained to get his jump were a finite source causing him to shrivel and weaken over time thanks to his time trapped within the force dimension however grodd gained an even greater acceleration of his development not only retaining his previous abilities of bolstered strength and super speed but also accelerating his developmental process granting him telepathy much like what his species elders grow into with age as well as telekinesis which is unique to him 28 for a brief time grodd s connection to the light had dimmed due to an infraction of clashing timelines but he would again regain his abilities after having siphoned the lion s share of barry allen s speed force abilities after contracting a fatal illness 29 establishing his connection to the speed force and strengthening his formidable psionic abilities once again 30 after joining luthor s legion of doom grodd would come into all new powers thanks to acting as the guardian of the turtle s latest life incarnation 31 now acting as a crucible to channel the infant turtle s still force powers grodd can now use that same hidden energy to further bolster his telepathy as well as sap energy from other speed force conduits inhibiting their ability of rapid motion to an unknown extent on top of grinding universal expansion to a standstill using its power over entropy 32 other versions edit antimatter universe edit gorilla grodd has a counterpart on the post crisis antimatter universe s earth called general grodd who is a member of the justice underground he is a freedom fighter from a militaristic ape nation 36
