the monitor of new earth suggests that duela s father is actually an alternate version of the joker indicating she didn t belong making others think she was the joker s daughter which on that world she most certainly was not 8 dan didio editor in chief of dc has stated that duela s murder would have a ripple effect throughout the series 9 nightwing robin donna troy wonder girl and ravager set

and her stepfather the earth 3 riddler and together the three formed the riddler family when she was finally introduced to her birth father she dropped cryptic hints implying that she or her consciousness shifts unknowingly from earth to earth which is the source of her parental confusion when the jokester joined the riddler family duela revealed that she had been in a relationship with talon owlman s teenaged sidekick the jokester renounced her as his daughter and duela left with talon moments before the crime society stormed their apartment the riddler was killed by ultraman and three face s arm was torn off by superwoman the jokester managed to flee until he is later tracked down and killed by solomon the monitor who killed duela the new 52 edit in september 2011 the new 52 rebooted dc s continuity in this new timeline duela dent is re established in catwoman 23 11 the character was featured in the villains month one shot comic book batman the dark knight 23 4 12 and in early 2014 the character was further explored in yet another one shot 13 in the aftermath of death of the family in which the joker seemingly falls to his death 14 his face which he previously had cut off 15 is found by a psychotic young woman living in the sewers the woman wears the severed flesh as a mask dubbing herself the joker s daughter she becomes obsessed with not only serving the joker but also with having his blood course inside of her so she can truly become his daughter refusing to accept the joker s apparent death she begins harming murdering and destroying other people and property in order to find him and get his attention this leads her to the dollmaker who is responsible for removing the joker s face per his request after making a deal with each other dollmaker gives the joker s daughter vials of her father s blood so she could inject it into her veins and he sews the joker s face onto hers after failing to find her father the joker s daughter gives up hope until she receives a note from someone claiming to be the joker 13 during batman eternal joker s daughter participates in the mass scheme against batman including attempting to use the spirits of arkham to

following villains joker 20 catwoman 21 scarecrow 22 riddler 22 penguin 22 two face 22 doomsday doctor light punch and jewelee duela is originally depicted as the daughter of two face and his estranged wife gilda dent creator bob rozakis stated it didn t take too long to decide whose daughter she would turn out to be after all the only married villain was two face i convinced editor julius schwartz and associate editor e nelson bridwell the acknowledged keeper of dc s historical consistency that harvey and gilda dent had a daughter that harvey had been disappointed because she wasn t a twin and that they d named her duela 23 rozakis upon being asked his thought regarding the current insane version of duela dent who claims to be the daughter of multiple supervillains replied i got a laugh out of it when i first saw it but i thought they wasted the character i realize that marv and company didn t want her around anymore and felt they had to explain her away because of continuity but they could have just as easily ignored her actually i consider harley quinn to be a reincarnation of duela 23 it is later revealed that the earth 3 hero the jokester is her biological father and three face evelyn dent is her mother since evelyn disappeared from duela s father s life while she was still pregnant he was not aware of duela s existence until her teen years as a result duela s stepfather the riddler helped evelyn raise her upon meeting the clown prince of crime duela started calling herself the joker s daughter even though her real father s hero name was the jokester other

follow his style so has the joker inspired a few to take after his chaotic clown style the original joker s daughter who actually turned out to be two face s daughter was a former member of the teen titans and has no direct relation to this new riot girl version nor is there a true familial relation to the joker the joker s daughter ii is modeled on jill thompson a writer artist thompson is chicago based as is alex ross austin loomis adds that thompson has occasionally drawn herself into stories that she was illustrating for vertigo it is noted throughout this series that the joker s daughter ii is always quite dour and serious quite the change from her namesake and another example of the generational clash theme of kingdom come following the death of von bach ex1machina points

observed that barbara gordon s batgirl reflected the women s liberation movement of the 1960s 86 during the 1980s barbara kesel after writing a complaint to dc comics over the negative portrayal of female characters was given the opportunity to write for barbara gordon in detective comics robin anne reid in women in science fiction and fantasy overviews 2009 wrote that kesel s version of batgirl established her as a character separate from batman and robin a woman motivated to do what men do but alone and in her own way her secret origins 1987 and batgirl special 1988 countered the victimized and objectified presentation of barbara gordon batgirl in alan moore s acclaimed the killing joke 1988 87 she notes that kesel s interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence technological skill and ability to overcome fear gail simone included the character s paralysis in a list of major female characters that had been killed mutilated and depowered dubbing the phenomenon women in refrigerators in reference to a 1994 green lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend s mutilated body in his refrigerator 28 simone highlighted the gender difference regarding the treatment of batman and batgirl regarding paralysis by stating that b oth had their backs broken batman broke his in a dramatic batcave confrontation with the villain bane batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the joker never given a chance to fight less than a year later batman was fine batgirl now named oracle was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years 26 in superheroes and superegos analyzing the minds behind the masks 2010 author sharon packer wrote that a nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to gordon s accident is advised to consult the source material calling the work sadistic to the core 88 brian cronin noted that many readers felt the violence towards barbara gordon was too much and even moore in retrospect has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out 27 jeffrey a brown author of dangerous curves action heroines gender fetishism and popular culture 2011 noted the killing joke as an example of the inherent misogyny of the male dominated comic book industry in light of the relatively unequal violence female characters are subjected to 89 while male characters may be critically injured or killed they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage 89 reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated if audiences had grown tired of batgirl it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly 87 despite views that present the character s batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment a long held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of batman rather than standing alone as leader such as wonder woman who had no pre existing male counterpart 90 in analyzing stereotypes in gender jackie marsh noted that male superheroes such as batman are depicted as hyper masculine and anti social while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names such as the batgirl character 91 representation for librarians edit in the image and role of the librarian 2002 wendi arant and candace r benefiel argue that batgirl s portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for united states congress barbara gordon is seen as being given a career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up 11 in the essay librarians professionalism and image stereotype and reality 2007 abigail luthmann views the character less favorably stating that t he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low visibility disguise for her crime fighting alter ego and while her information locating skills may have been useful to her extra curricular activities no direct examples are given 92 representation for asian americans edit while many fans were outraged when dc comics turned cassandra into a villainess it does gel with notions of asian women as not just mysterious and exotic but also as deceitful and dangerous that cassandra s turn to villainy is linked with her mother the sexy and deadly modern dragon lady implicitly aligns her ethnic heritage and her gender with the most negative connotations of orientalism jeffrey a brown dangerous curves action heroines gender fetishism and popular culture 2011 89 the cassandra cain version of batgirl depicted as a biracial character half white and half chinese is notable as one of the most prominent characters of asian descent to appear in american comic books jeffrey a brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects however in the case of batgirl cassandra s racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent 89 the fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women and asian women in particular 89 the most controversial aspect of her character came about during the one year later event when she is reintroduced as a villain the abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership 93 when questioned about the change in characterization writer adam beechen stated they didn t present me with a rationale as to why cassandra was going to change or a motivating factor that was left for me to come up with and them to approve and we did that but as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction i honestly couldn t answer 38 in other media edit see also barbara gordon in other media yvonne craig as batgirl portrayed by yvonne craig the character s first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of batman 1967 barbara gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and batman in the second season episodes batman s waterloo and the duo defy les daniels in batman the complete history 2004 wrote that the goal of abc was to attract new audience members especially idealistic young girls and less high minded older men 6 according to craig i used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew i could ride my own motorcycle i realized they hired me because i had a cartoon voice 6 a shared criticism of batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later such as wonder woman and the bionic woman is that she was not allowed to engage in hand to hand combat on screen 84 as such her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent s face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use 84 however craig has also stated i meet young women who say batgirl was their role model they say it s because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do and sometimes better i think that s lovely 94 during the early 1970s craig portrayed batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women 90 since batman the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media 90 as batgirl barbara gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series voiced by jane webb in the batman superman hour 1968 melendy britt in the new adventures of batman 1977

illustrated by gustave doré an ogre feminine ogress is a legendary monster usually depicted as a large hideous man like being that eats ordinary human beings especially infants and children 1 ogres frequently feature in mythology folklore and fiction throughout the world they appear in many classic works of literature and are most often associated in fairy tales and legend with a taste for infants in mythology ogres are often depicted as inhumanly large tall and having a disproportionately large head abundant hair unusually colored skin a voracious appetite and a strong body ogres are closely linked with giants and with human cannibals in mythology in both folklore and fiction giants are often given ogrish traits such as the giants in jack and the beanstalk and jack the giant killer the giant despair in the pilgrim s progress and the jötunn of norse mythology while ogres may be given giant like traits famous examples of ogres in folklore include the ogre in puss in boots

illustrated by walter crane the word ogre is of french origin originally derived from the etruscan god orcus who fed on human flesh its earliest attestation is in chrétien de troyes late 12th century verse romance perceval li contes del graal which contains the lines et s est escrit que il ert ancore que toz li reaumes de logres qui jadis fu la terre as ogres ert destruite par cele lance and it is written that he will come again to all the realms of logres which was formerly land of ogres and destroy them with that lance the ogres in this rhyme may refer to the ogres who were in the pseudohistorical work history of the kings of britain by geoffrey of monmouth the inhabitants of britain prior to human settlement the italian author giambattista basile 1575 1632 used the related neapolitan word uerco or in standard italian orco in some of his tales this word is documented 2 in earlier italian works fazio degli uberti 14th century luigi pulci 15th century ludovico ariosto 15th 16th centuries and has even older cognates with the latin orcus and the old english orcnēas found in beowulf lines 112 113 which inspired j r r tolkien s orc 3 all these words may derive from a shared indo european mythological concept as tolkien himself speculated as cited by tom shippey the road to middle earth 45 the dictionary of the academy of france alternatively states that the name is derived from the word hongrois which means hungarian as of western cultures referred to hungarians as a kind of monstrosity 4 ogre could possibly also derive citation needed from the biblical og last of the giants or from the greek river god oiagros father of orpheus the word ogre came into wider usage in the works of charles perrault 1628 1703 or marie catherine jumelle de berneville comtesse d aulnoy 1650 1705 both of whom were french authors the first appearance of the word ogre in perrault s work occurred in his histoires ou contes du temps passé 1696 it later appeared in several of his other fairy tales many of which were based on the neapolitan tales of basile the first example of a female ogre being referred to as an ogress is found in his version of sleeping beauty where it is spelled ogresse madame d aulnoy first employed the word ogre in her story l orangier et l abeille 1698 and was the first to use the word ogree to refer to the creature s offspring fairy tales that

portrayed as a consummate professional as long as he has been paid to kill someone he will always carry it out without exceptions batman was unable to get him to stop threatening a witness by threatening deadshot or his family deadshot rightly assumed that batman was bluffing however batman ultimately does get deadshot to abort the hit by freezing his client s bank accounts unable to get paid deadshot publicly cancelled the assassination letting the witness go free perhaps his most defining trait is his acknowledged death wish which often manifests as him deliberately engineering situations likely to kill him this makes him unpredictable as an opponent as his willingness to die allows him to deliberately injure himself to achieve a goal for example during identity crisis he deliberately shoots himself in the neck while fighting kyle rayner so that rayner would attempt to save him and drop his guard allowing lawton to take aim and almost shoot him he often expresses disappointment at surviving his missions such as immediately lamenting damn when awakening in a hospital in his run on suicide squad john ostrander delved into deadshot s past and family background the revelation of deadshot having a brother whom he idolized seemed to resonate with deadshot s attachment to rick flag team leader ostrander implied that this relationship also colored deadshot s rivalry with batman whom deadshot had always been unable or subconsciously unwilling to kill he is known to be sarcastic and profane often cursing whenever frustrated or angered collected editions

in american comic books published by dc comics co created by alan grant and norm breyfogle he first appeared in detective comics 608 november 1989 as an adversary of batman anarky is introduced as lonnie machin a child prodigy with knowledge of radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions stories revolving around anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes the character who is named after the philosophy of anarchism primarily espouses anti statism and attacks capitalism however multiple social issues have been addressed through the character including environmentalism antimilitarism economic inequality and political corruption inspired by multiple sources early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical texts and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists the inspiration for the creation of the character and its early development was based in grant s personal interest in anti authoritarian philosophy and politics 1 however when grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of neo tech developed by frank r wallace he shifted the focus of anarky from a vehicle for social anarchism and then libertarian socialism with an emphasis on wealth redistribution and critique of crony capitalism to a neo tech economy 2 originally intended to only be used in the debut story in which he appeared grant decided to continue using anarky as a sporadically recurring character throughout the early 1990s following positive reception by readers and dennis o neil 3 the character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late 1990s when breyfogle convinced grant to produce a limited series based on the character the 1997 spin off series anarky was received with positive reviews and sales and later declared by grant to be among his career highlights 4 batman anarky a trade paperback collection of stories featuring the character soon followed this popular acclaim culminated however in a financially and critically unsuccessful ongoing solo series the 1999 anarky series in which even grant has expressed his distaste was quickly canceled after eight issues 1 5 following the cancellation of the anarky series and grant s departure from dc comics anarky experienced a prolonged period of absence from dc publications despite professional and fan interest in his return 6 7 this period of obscurity lasted approximately nine years with three brief interruptions for minor cameo appearances in 2000 2001 and 2005 in 2008 anarky reappeared in an issue of robin authored by fabian nicieza with the intention of ending this period of obscurity 8 9 10 the storyline drastically altered the character s presentation prompting a series of responses by nicieza to concerned readers 11 12 anarky became a recurring character in issues of red robin authored by nicieza until the series was cancelled in 2011 in the aftermath of the new 52 13 a new anarky was introduced into the new 52 continuity in october 2013 in an issue of green lantern corps which itself was a tie in to the batman zero year storyline 14 yet more characters have been authored as using the anarky alias in the new 52 continuity via the pages of detective comics 15 16 and earth 2 society 17 from 2013 anarky began to be featured more heavily in media adaptations of dc comics properties across multiple platforms 18 in july a revamped version of anarky was debuted as the primary antagonist in beware the batman a batman animated series produced by warner bros animation 19 20 in october the character made his video game debut in batman arkham origins as a villain who threatens government and corporate institutions with destruction 21 anarky made his live action debut in

included the cover among a gallery of his favorite works 23 see also anarky in gotham city originally inspired by his personal political leanings alan grant entertained the idea of interjecting anarchist philosophy into batman comic books in an attempt to emulate the success of chopper a rebellious youth in judge dredd he conceptualized a character as a 12 year old anarchist vigilante who readers would sympathize with despite his harsh methods 24 additionally in the wake of the death of jason todd grant hoped that anarky could be used as the new robin 25 creating the character without any consultation from his partner illustrator norm breyfogle 26 his only instructions to breyfogle were that anarky be designed as a cross between v and the black spy from mad magazine s spy vs spy 3 the character was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth and so was fitted with a crude head extender that elongated his neck creating a jarring appearance this was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer alan grant to disguise the character s true identity and to confuse the reader into believing anarky to be an adult 27 while both of these design elements have since been dropped more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask priestly hat and his golden cane 28 the first anarky story anarky in gotham city part 1 letters to the editor appeared in detective comics 608 in november 1989 lonnie machin is introduced as anarky as early as his first appearance in detective comics 608 withholding his origin story for a later point he is established as an uncommonly philosophical and intelligent 12 year old 29 lonnie machin made his debut as anarky by responding to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the offending sources such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water 29 anarky and batman ultimately come to blows and during their brief fight batman deduces that anarky is actually a young child during this first confrontation anarky is aided by a band of homeless men including legs a homeless cripple who becomes loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances after being caught lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center 30 anarky series edit anarky not having any super powers doesn t have what it takes to bring the fans in month after month he s the sort of character you can get away with using in an annual once a year plus his own miniseries once a year and maybe as a guest star every couple of years but he s not capable he s not strong enough to hold his own monthly title very few characters are when it comes down to it alan grant 2007 1 main article anarky comic book following the comic book industry crash of 1996 norm breyfogle sought new employment at dc comics darren vincenzo then an editorial assistant at the company suggested multiple projects which breyfogle could take part in among his suggestions was an anarky limited series to be written by grant or another specified author following encouragement from breyfogle grant agreed to participate in the project 31 the four issue limited series anarky was published in may 1997 entitled metamorphosis the story maintained the character s anti authoritarian sentiments but was instead based on neo tech a philosophy based on objectivism developed by frank r wallace 2 well received by critics and financially successful grant has referred to the limited series as one of his favorite projects and ranked it among his career highlights 4 with its success vincenzo suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to breyfogle and grant although grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable he agreed to write it at breyfogle s insistence as the illustrator was still struggling for employment 31 building on the increasing exposure of the series a trade paperback featuring the character titled batman anarky was published however grant s doubts concerning the ongoing series s prospects eventually proved correct the second series was panned by critics failed to catch on among readers and was canceled after eight issues but grant has noted that it was popular in latin american countries supposing this was due to a history of political repression in the region 3 32 absence from dc publications edit we don t have any conclusive evidence but alan and i can t help but feel that anarky s philosophy grated on somebody s nerves somebody got a look at it and didn t like it so i ve generally gotten the impression that anarky was nixed because of its philosophy especially in this age of post 9 11 anarky would be a challenge to established authority he s very anti establishment that s why he s named anarky norm breyfogle 2003 6 after the financial failure of anarky vol 2 the character entered a period of absence from dc publications that lasted several years norm breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics during this time when his efforts were rejected he came to suspect the character s prolonged absence was due in part to censorship 6 since the cancellation of the anarky series grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character simply stating you have to let these things go 5 in 2005 james peaty succeeded in temporarily returning anarky to publication writing green arrow 51 anarky in the usa although the front cover of the issue advertised the comic as the return of the character anarky failed to make any further appearances 33 this was despite comments by peaty that he had further plans to write stories for the character 34 anarky retained interest among a cult fan base during this obscure period 31 during a panel at wondercon 2006 multiple requests were made by the audience for anarky to appear in dc comics limited series 52 in response editors and writers of 52 indicated anarky would be included in the series but the series concluded without anarky making an appearance and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series for the failed appearance i return as moneyspider edit i took 2 characters who had not been seen in 10 years and told a story with them that sets up the potential for more stories to be told using those characters i call that a good day at the office fabian nicieza 2009 12 anarky reappeared in the december issue of robin 181 8 with the publication of robin 181 search for a hero part 5 pushing buttons pulling strings on december 17 2008 it was revealed that lonnie machin s role as anarky had been supplanted by another batman villain ulysses armstrong fabian nicieza author of the issue and storyline in which anarky appeared depicted the character as being held hostage by armstrong paralyzed and catatonic 11 encased in an iron lung and connected to computers through his brain this final feature allowed the character to connect to the internet and communicate with others via a speech synthesizer 35 nicieza s decision to give machin s mantle as anarky to another character was due to his desire to establish him as a nemesis for tim drake while respecting the original characterization of anarky who nicieza recognized as neither immature nor a villain regardless nicieza did desire to use machin and properly return the character to publication and so favored presenting ulysses h armstrong as anarky and lonnie machin as moneyspider a reference to a secondary name briefly used by grant for anarky in storyline published in 1990 ii fabian nicieza reintroduced lonnie machin to publication as moneyspider a supporting character for tim drake in the concluding story arc of robin and its follow up series red robin 11 the reactions to robin 181 included negative commentary from political commentator and scholar roderick long 36 and alan grant himself 37 among fans who interacted with nicieza in a forum discussion some responses were also negative prompting responses from nicieza in his own defense 11 12 with the conclusion of robin nicieza began authoring the 2009 azrael series leaving any future use of anarky or moneyspider to author christopher yost who would pick up the robin character in a new red robin series in the ensuing months yost only made one brief reference to anarky without directly involving the character in a story plot 38 in april 2010 nicieza replaced yost as the author of red robin and nicieza was quick to note his interest in using anarky and moneyspider in future issues of the series 39 nicieza reintroduced ulysses armstrong and lonnie machin within his first storyline beginning in red robin 16 the hit list in december 2010 40 nicieza then proceeded to regularly use lonnie as a cast member of the ongoing red robin series until its cancellation in october 2011 the series was concluded as a result of the new 52 a revamp and relaunch by dc comics of its entire line of ongoing monthly superhero books in which all of its existing titles were canceled 52 new series debuted in september 2011 with new 1 issues to replace the cancelled titles 13 the new 52 edit while anarky was rising in profile in other media by mid 2013 the character had yet to be reintroduced to the status quo of the post new 52 dc universe 41 this changed on august 12 when dc comics announced that anarky would be reintroduced in green lantern corps 25 powers that be on november 13 the issue was a tie in to the batman zero year crossover event authored by van jensen and co plotted by robert venditti 42 in the lead up to the publication date at a panel event at the new york comic con jensen was asked by a fan holding a plush anarky doll what the character s role would be in the story jensen explained that anarky would have a very big hand in the story and further explained you can understand what he s doing even if you don t agree with what he s doing 43 jensen had also indicated that his version of anarky would be a fresh take that also honors his legacy 44 the story featured a character study of john stewart narrating stewart s final mission as a young marine in the midst of a gotham city power blackout and citywide evacuation mere days before a major storm is to hit the city anarky is depicted as rallying a group of followers and evacuees to occupy a sports stadium on the basis that the area the stadium was built upon was gentrified at the expense of the local community and should be returned to them 14 the storyline brought two particular additions to the revamped version of anarky the first being that this new version of anarky is portrayed as an african american the second being to preserve the character s anonymity as anarky escapes custody at the end of the story without an identity behind the mask being revealed 45 another version of anarky debuted in the post new 52 detective comics series written by francis manapul and brian buccellato 15 16 this character is not the same anarky that appeared in batman zero year but rather a corrupt politician named sam young who used the anarky persona to exact revenge on the mad hatter for murdering his sister 46 a female version of anarky from the alternate reality of earth two was introduced in earth 2 society s 2015 story line godhood by daniel h wilson prior to the fictional events of the series this anarky detonated a bomb in the city of neotropolis that resulted in a public riot she disappears before superman and power girl can apprehend her in the series she is portrayed as a hacker that is allied with such characters as doctor impossible the hourman and johnny sorrow 17 dc rebirth edit teased as a very unlikely ally 47 anarky appears for the first time in dc rebirth in may 2017 revealed in detective comics 957 may 2016 a redesigned anarky offers to help spoiler in her new quest against vigilantism in gotham 48 in 2018 the character was featured in the one shot issue red hood vs anarky here pitted against the former robin jason todd writer tim seeley expressed that he decided to pair up the red hood and anarky because he feels that they were similar characters to me what made that pairing interesting is that red hood is the bad seed of the family to some degree and i can play that against anarky who in some ways could be a fallen member of the bat family the way that james tynion played anarky in detective comics is he shared a lot of the same goals and motivations with the gotham knights team but he s also a guy who has a tendency to run afoul of batman s beliefs 49 characterization edit the cover of detective comics 609 contrasts anarky as a champion of the oppressed and batman as a champion of the law art by norm breyfogle anarky has undergone several shifts in his characterization over the course of the character s existence these were largely decided upon by alan grant who between the creation of anarky to the end of the 1999 anarky series was largely the sole author of the character after the departure of grant and breyfogle from dc comics anarky s characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter description and motivations edit lonnie machin is introduced as a twelve year old school boy an only child he shares his physical traits of light skin and red hair with both of his parents mike and roxanne machin a middle class family living in gotham city 29 the character s age was continuously adjusted over the course of several years stated to be fourteen during the anarky ultimatum in robin annual 1 50 it is reestablished as fifteen during the events of the anarky limited series 51 and adjusted as 16 the following year during the ongoing series 52 grant laconically described lonnie machin as a serious beyond his years teenager who wants to set the world to rights 53 as the character was based on a theme of ideas he had initially been given no personal tragic past a common motivator in superhero fiction this was intended to contrast with batman who fought crime due to personal tragedy while anarky would do so in the name of ideals and beliefs 24 as the character was further developed he was also intended to contrast with common teenage superheroes referring to the tradition established by stan lee and jack kirby of saddling teenagers with personal problems grant purposely gave anarky none nor did he develop a girlfriend or social life for the character as grant wrote for the batman anarky introduction this was intended to convey the idea that anarky was single minded in his goals 24 in one of the earliest explorations of lonnie machin s back story in the anarky ultimatum grant described lonnie as a voracious reader but also of being isolated from peers his own age during his childhood 50 this was elaborated upon years later in the anarky storyline which described lonnie as having lost a childhood friend living in an impoverished nation the latter suffering the loss of his family due to civil war and strife before disappearing entirely the resulting shock of discovering at such a young age that the world was in turmoil precipitated lonnie machin s rapid maturation and eventual radicalization 54 heroic and villainous themes edit anarky s introduction during the late 1980s was part of a larger shift among supervillains in the batman franchise of the time while many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership some were introduced to challenge readers to question the whole bad good guy divide falling into the stereotype anarchist bomb toting image anarky s design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast 55 in a review of the anarky miniseries anarky was dubbed an anti villain as opposed to antihero due to his highly principled philosophy which runs counter to most villains in the age of the anti hero it only makes sense to have the occasional anti villain as well but unlike sociopathic vigilante anti heroes like the punisher an anti villain like anarky provides some interesting food for thought sure he breaks the law but what he really wants is to save the world and maybe he s right 56 breyfogle s characterization of anarky has shifted on occasion with him at times referring to anarky as a villain and at other times as a hero in his 1998 introductory essay composed for batman anarky breyfogle characterized anarky as not being a villain but rather a misunderstood hero and continued that he s a philosophical action hero an aristotle in tights rising above mere crime fighter status into the realm of incisive social commentary 28 a year later breyfogle conceded that anarky was technically a villain but insisted i don t consider him a villain 27 breyfogle later reconsidered the character in more ambiguous terms for a 2005 interview anarky isn t a villain he s his own character he s definitely not a superhero although it depends on who you talk to 57 anarky s world clashes as much with the traditional world of superheroes as it does with the world of crime so the interplay between him and green lantern and him and superman is not the usual kind of hero interplay alan grant 1998 58 grant has been more direct in his description of anarky s virtuous attributes in my eyes anarky s a hero anarky s the hero i want to be if i was smart enough and physically fit enough acknowledging that anarky s moral perspective was guided by his own grant expressed that the conflict between anarky and other heroes is a result of their political divisions in my eyes he s a hero but to others they see him as a villain that is because most people might gripe about the political situation or various aspects of the political situation and wouldn t advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live anarky certainly does that and more 58 in creating stories involving anarky other writers have played off this anti heroic and anti villainous tension james peaty made the heroic and political comparisons between lonnie machin and oliver queen the central theme of his 2005 green arrow story anarky in the usa anarky comes to find ollie because of his reputation and is quite disappointed in ollie s reaction towards him however as the story unfolds ollie has to re assess his initial reaction to anarky and his own much vaunted radical credentials 34 with his controversial revival of the character in 2008 fabian nicieza chose to portray the mantle of anarky as being possessed by a villain other than lonnie machin on the grounds that lonnie was too heroic to act out the part of a black hat since lonnie is too smart to be immature and not a villain i wanted anarky but it couldn t be lonnie without compromising who he is as a character 11 so one of the reasons i really like anarky is he s a kind of classic anti villain right like he s trying to do the right thing he believes he s doing the right thing from batman s perspective he s not but from a dramatic perspective if you look at him there s a really good argument to be made for what he does and why he does it eric holmes 2013 59 in the character s 2013 video game debut in batman arkham origins creative director eric holmes dubbed anarky a classic anti villain 59 a social activist who wishes to liberate and free people anarky views himself as a hero akin to batman and offers an alliance with him but his approach is rebuked on the basis that their methods are nothing alike 60 nonetheless he attracts a following among the city s downtrodden and particularly the homeless whom he protects from the hostility of police officers 41 this special relationship between the homeless who look up to a villain who in turn acts as their protector against police who prey upon them was intended to present an area of grey morality for the player to consider 59 on two occasions grant nearly went against dennis o neil s early wish that anarky not kill opponents these events include his appearance during the batman knightfall saga in which grant briefly portrayed anarky as preparing to kill both the scarecrow and batman azrael 61 grant also implied anarky was a lethal figure in the last batman story part of armageddon 2001 crossover event in the story a time traveler shows batman a possible future in the relatively not too distant year of 2001 an aged batman is framed and sentenced to death for murder but anarky now an adult sympathizes with the fallen hero and breaks into the prison in an attempt to rescue batman the latter resists his help on the basis that anarky has killed others in the past and the two never reconciled their differences 62 grant later expressed relief that he had not fully committed to portraying anarky as a potential murderer as he felt anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal killer 24 anarky was given a non lethal approach in the batman adventures 31 anarky written by alan grant who acted as a guest author for the issue anarky takes business elites hostage and places them on public trial broadcast from a pirate television show he charges these men with such crimes as the creation of land mines that kill or cripple thousands funding third world dictators polluting the air with toxic chemicals and profiting from wage slavery and threatens each man with a bomb if the public should find them guilty when the explosions take place it is revealed that the bombs are fake and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness one bomb explosion carried a specific message it unfurled a banner that denounced lethal weapons 63 contradicting anarky s non lethal portrayal entries for the character in who s who in the dc universe 64 the dc comics encyclopedia 65 and the supervillain book 66 have falsely referred to anarky as having killed criminals in early appearances norm breyfogle was also under the false impression that anarky had killed for several years having failed to realize the original script for anarky s debut storyline had been rewritten grant eventually explained the situation to breyfogle in 2006 during a joint interview 1 despite this regular equivocation of anarky with murder and villainy in dc comics character guides the company made efforts to describe the character in heroic terms in promoting the 1999 anarky series during this time dc comics described anarky as an anti establishment loose cannon trying to do good as a hero to the disenfranchised 67 political and philosophical themes edit anarky is a philosophical action hero an aristotle in tights rising above mere crime fighter status into the realm of incisive social commentary in fact anarky exists primarily to challenge the status quo of hierarchical power and he may be the first mainstream comics hero of his type to do it consistently and with such rational intelligence norm breyfogle 1998 28 in the initial years following anarky s creation grant rarely incorporated the character into batman stories being reserved for stories in which the author wished to make a philosophical point 24 originally grant created anarky as an anarchist with socialist and populist leanings in this early incarnation anarky was designed as an avatar for grant s personal meditations on political philosophy and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism 1 within the books the nature of the character s political opinions were often expressed through the character s rhetoric and by heavy use of the circle a as a character gimmick the character s tools often incorporate the circle a motif into them in his earliest incarnation he would also use red spray paint to leave the circle a as a calling card at crime scenes 29 the circle a has also been used to decorate the character s base of operations either as graffiti or suspended from wall tapestries 35 50 68 in some instances anarky s political behavior would stand as the only political element of the story 50 69 while in other instances entire stories would be framed to create a political parable in batman shadow of the bat annual 2 an elseworlds story entitled the tyrant grant made dictatorship and the corrupting influence of power the primary theme batman under the influence of jonathan crane uses his resources to usurp power in the city of gotham and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city s population anarky becomes a resistance leader undermining the centers of batman s power and ultimately overthrowing bruce wayne s tyranny 70 the story ends with a quote by mikhail bakunin for reasons of the state black becomes white and white becomes black the horrible becomes humane and the most dastardly felonies and atrocious crimes become meritorious acts 71 during the early years of the character s development virtually no writers other than grant used anarky in dc publications in the singular portrayal by an author other than grant during this period writer kevin dooley used anarky in an issue of green arrow producing an explicitly anti firearm themed story throughout the narrative dialogue between anarky and green arrow conveys the need for direct action as anarky attempts to persuade oliver queen to sympathize with militant economic sabotage in pursuit of social justice 72 lonnie machin defends his actions in detective comics 620 political elements include machin s dialogue the circle a painted in the background and an issue of black flag being read in the foreground by tim drake 68 literary cues illustrated into scenes were occasionally used whenever anarky was a featured character in a comic during the anarky limited series fluttering newspapers were used to bear headlines alluding to social problems 73 74 occasionally the titles of books found in anarky s room would express the character s philosophical political or generally esoteric agenda in both detective comics 620 and batman shadow of the bat 40 a copy of v for vendetta can be seen on lonnie machin s bookshelf as homage 69 75 other books in his room at different times have included apostles of revolution by max nomad the anarchists by james joll books labeled proudhon and bakunin and an issue of black flag 75 non anarchist material included books labeled plato aristotle and swedenborg 69 and a copy of synergetics by buckminster fuller 76 the character also made references to universe by scudder klyce an extremely rare book 30 54 when asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references grant explained that he hadn t expected many to do so but reported encountering some who had and that one particular reader of the 1999 anarky series had carried out an ongoing correspondence with him on the topic as of 2005 3 although i haven t read them in chronological order i would think it would be quite easy to see the parallel between anarky s thought processes and my own thought processes alan grant 1997 2 over the course of several years grant s political opinions shifted from social anarchism to libertarian socialism and then to precepts associated with objectivism grant later speculated that this transformation would be detectable within stories he d written by 1997 grant s philosophy settled on neo tech which was developed by frank r wallace and when given the opportunity to write an anarky miniseries he decided to redesign the character accordingly grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue s publication i felt he was the perfect character to express neo tech philosophy because he s human he has no special powers the only power he s got is the power of his own rational consciousness 2 this new characterization was continued in the 1999 anarky ongoing series the limited and ongoing series were both heavily influenced by neo tech despite the term never appearing in a single issue new emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes such as the depiction of anarky as an atheist and a rationalist 77 grant also expressed a desire to use the comic as a vehicle for his thoughts concerning the mind and consciousness 5 and made bicameral mentality a major theme of both series 78 while this trend led the character away from the philosophies he had espoused previously the primary theme of the character remained anti statism in one issue of the 1999 series a character asked what the nature of anarky s politics were the response was that anarky was neither right wing nor left wing and that he transcends the political divide 79 grant has specified that he categorized anarky politically as an anarchist who tried to put anarchist values into action 80 norm breyfogle also stated in 1999 that the character represented anarchist philosophy 27 but said in 2003 that he believed the neo tech influence allowed anarky to be classified as an objectivist 6 skills abilities and resources edit the audaciousness of a non super powered teenager functioning as a highly effective adult without a mentor is pretty iconoclastic in a genre where it sometimes appears it s all been done before norm breyfogle 1998 28 grant developed anarky as a gadgeteer a character who relies on inventions and gadgets to compensate for a lack of superpowers and as a child prodigy in early incarnations he was portrayed as highly intelligent but inexperienced lacking in many skills he survived largely by his ingenuity in accordance with this he would occasionally quote the maxim the essence of anarchy is surprise 30 by 1991 a profile of the character following the introduction of anarky s skills as a hacker in the rite of passage storyline of detective comics 620 described that lonnie s inventive genius is equaled only by his computer wizardry 64 anarky s abilities were increased during the character s two eponymous series being portrayed as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology as well as prodigiously developing skills in martial arts this was indicated in several comics published just before the anarky miniseries and later elaborated upon within the series itself early skills and equipment edit described as physically frail in comparison to the adults he opposes the character often utilizes cunning improvisation and intelligence as tools for victory during the knightfall saga the character states the essence of anarchy is surprise spontaneous action even when it does require a little planning 81 early descriptions of the character s gadgets focused on low tech improvised tools and munitions such as flare guns 61 swing lines 50 throwing stars 82 small spherical shelled explosives with burning fuses mimicking round mortar bombs stereotypically associated with 19th century anarchists 29 gas bombs 29 smoke bombs 50 and his primary weapon a powerful electric stun baton shaped as a golden cane 29 as a wanted criminal anarky s methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community or the public at large relegating him to underground operation when in need of assistance he would call on the help of the homeless community in gotham who had supported him since his first appearance 30 anarky was described as having developed skills as a computer hacker to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations in his second appearance part of the rite of passage storyline in detective comics 620 83 this addition to the character s skill set made him the second major hacker in the dc universe being preceded by barbara gordon s debut as oracle 84 and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks 50 anarky series ability upgrades edit according to alan grant the urgency with which anarky views his cause has necessitated that the character forsake any social life and increase his abilities drastically over the years in his introduction of batman anarky the kid s whole life is dedicated to self improvement with the sole aim of destroying the parasitic elites who he considers feast off ordinary folks 24 a review of the first issue of the 1999 series described anarky as akin to a batman jr the reviewer continued that grant writes lonnie like a teenager who is head and shoulders above the rest of the population but still a kid 85 in 1995 grant used the two part anarky storyline in batman shadow of the bat to alter the character s status quo in several ways that would reach their fruition in the first anarky series to accomplish this feat several plot devices were used to increase lonnie s abilities to justify the character s financial independence anarky was described as using the internet to earn money through his online bookstore anarco which he used as a front company to propagate his philosophy a second front organization the anarkist foundation was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports 86 a biofeedback learning enhancer was employed to increase lonnie s abilities the cybernetic device was described as being capable of amplifying brain functions by a multiple of ten 86 anarky was also described as having begun to train in martial arts following the character s time in juvenile hall 87 the 1997 anarky limited series saw the earlier plot devices of the preceding anarky storyline become narrative justifications for drastically upgraded skill sets anarky s earlier brain augmentation was now described as having fused the hemispheres of his brain in a reference to bicameral mentality meanwhile the character s business enterprises were said to have gained him millions of dollars in the dot com bubble the character s combat abilities were described as having progressed remarkably and to have included training in multiple styles which he integrated into a hybrid fighting style 88 89 even the character s primary stun baton weapon was enhanced with a grappling hook incorporated into the walking stick itself to allow dual functionality 89 with this enhanced intelligence and financial assets the 1999 ongoing series narrates that anarky went on to create an on board ai computer max multi augmented x program 52 a crude but fully functioning teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube 90 and secretly excavated an underground base below the washington monument 52 portrayed as an atheist by grant anarky espoused the belief that science is magic explained and was shown to use scientific analysis to explain and manipulate esoteric forces of magic and energy 91 anarky s skill in software cracking was further increased to allow him to tap into batman s supercomputer 89 and the justice league watchtower 52 this evolution in anarky s abilities was criticized as having overpowered the character in a fanzing review of the anarky ongoing series the rapid development was seen as preventing the suspension of disbelief in the young character s adventures which was said to have contributed to the failure of the series 92 this view stood in contrast with that of breyfogle who considered anarky s heightened skill set to be a complementary feature and contended that anarky s advanced abilities lent uniqueness to the character breyfogle wrote anarky s singularity is due partly to his being at his age nearly as competent as batman 28 abilities as moneyspider edit in fabian niciza s stories for red robin lonnie machin s abilities as moneyspider were revamped with the character taking on the persona of an electronic ghost 11 comatose moneyspider was free to act through his mind via connections to the internet and interacted with others via text messaging and a speech synthesizer in this condition he acts to create an international web that will access the ins and outs of criminal and corporate operations 93 within virtual reality the character s augmented intelligence was described as a fused bicameral mind able to maintain a presence online at all times while another part of his mind separately interacted with others offline 94 costume edit designs by norm breyfogle edit the circle a a common anarchist symbol is frequently used as a gimmick to decorate anarky s costume the color red was chosen as a symbolic protest against war 27 anarky s costume has undergone several phases in design the first two of which were created by norm breyfogle in accordance with grant s suggestions the original costume was composed of a large flowing red robe over a matching red jumpsuit a red wide brimmed hat baring the circle a insignia a golden metallic face mask and red hood completed the outfit the folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets 29 breyfogle later expressed that the color scheme chosen held symbolic purpose the red robes represented the blood of all the innocents sacrificed in war the gold cane face mask and circle a symbol represented purity and spirituality the connection to spirituality was also emphasized through the hat and loose fabric which mimicked that of a priest breyfogle believed the loose clothes went better with a wide brimmed hat it s more of a colloquial style of clothing however observers have noted that breyfogle s christian upbringing may have also inspired the priestly analogy 27 anarky s fake head was unique and provided a drawing challenge in that the reader should later say so that s why anarky looked so awkward such awkwardness in fact was one reason i eliminated the fake head in the miniseries norm breyfogle 1998 28 this costume was also designed to disguise anarky s height and so included a head extender under his hood which elongated his neck this design was also intended to create a subtle awkwardness that the reader would subconsciously suspect as being fake until the reveal at the end of anarky s first appearance despite the revelation of this false head which would no longer serve its intended purpose at misdirecting the reader the head extender was included in several return appearances while at irregular times other artists drew the character without the extender v this discontinuity in the character s design ended when breyfogle finally eliminated this aspect of the character during the 1997 limited series expressing that the character s height growth had ended its usefulness 28 in reality breyfogle s decision was also as a result of the difficulty the design presented being awkward to draw in action situations 27 as an antihero anarky doesn t have to be beholden to one fashion statement vera h c chan 1999 27 anarky s second costume was used during the 1999 ongoing anarky series it retained the red jumpsuit gold mask and hat but excised the character s red robes new additions to the costume included a red cape a utility belt modeled after batman s utility belt and a single large circle a across the chest akin to superman s iconic s shield the golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective but flexible material that wrapped around anarky s head allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion this had previously been impossible as the first mask was made of inflexible metal being a relatively new creation breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design because anarky doesn t have 50 years of merchandising behind him i can change his costume whenever i want 27 within the anarky series secondary costumes were displayed in anarky s base of operations each was slightly altered in design but followed the same basic theme of color jumpsuit cloak and hat these were designed for use in various situations but only one a universal battle suit was used during the brief series 52 these suits were also intended to be seen in the unpublished ninth issue of the series 95 post breyfogle designs edit external image promotional cover art for robin no 182 by brian stelfreeze the costume design for the ulysses h armstrong version of anarky 96 in 2005 james peaty s green arrow story anarky in the usa featured a return to some of the costume elements used prior to the anarky series drawn by eric battle the circle a chest icon was removed in favor of a loose fabric jumpsuit completed with a flowing cape the flexible mask was replaced with the previous unmoving metallic mask but illustrated with a new reflective quality this design element was used at times to reflect the face of someone anarky looked at creating a mirroring of a person s emotions upon anarky s own mask 33 this same effect was later reused in two issues of red robin 97 98 for the usurpation of the anarky mantle by ulysses armstrong freddie williams ii illustrated a new costume design for armstrong that featured several different design elements while retaining the primary colors of gold and red the traditional hat was replaced with a hood and a new three piece cuirass with shoulder guards and leather belt was added the mask was also altered from an expressionless visage to a menacing grimace 35 this design was later re illustrated by marcus to in the red robin series but with a new color scheme in which red was replaced with black 40 alternative media designs edit external mediaimages batman arkham origins anarky promotional image this was the first of two promotional images released to feature anarky s design for the game 99 a promotional image of the dc collectibles anarky figurine this figurine was based on the design featured in batman arkham origins 101 video a promotional clip from beware the batman episode 3 tests this design was intended to thematically posit anarky as a reflection of batman and is thus almost entirely white 100 in attempting to present the character as a figurative mirror to batman the costume worn by anarky in beware the batman was radically redesigned as entirely white in contrast to batman s black batsuit it consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit cape hood flexible mask with white eye lenses and a utility belt upon the chest is a small stylized circle a in black 20 the design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for moon knight a marvel comics superhero 102 103 104 the costume redesign for anarky in batman arkham origins while stylized attempted to thematically highlight the character s anarchist sentiments by updating his appearance utilizing black bloc iconography 21 donning a red puffer flight jacket hoodie and cargo pants the character sported gold accents decorating his black belt backpack and combat boots and completed this with an orange bandana wrapped below his neck his metallic mask was replaced with a white theatrical stage mask evocative of the guy fawkes mask made popular among protesters by v for vendetta and anonymous 105 the jacket is itself emblazoned with a painted circle a the creative director of the game eric holmes commented that he looks like a street protester in our game and there s no accident to that 106 this design was later used as model for a dc collectibles figure released as part of a series based on villains featured in the game 101 reception edit impact on creators edit a large part of our relationship especially when we got into doing anarky became a friendly philosophical debate over politics and conspiracy theory mysticism versus scientism and all this other stuff we came to really enjoy those debates even when they rarely got a little heated norm breyfogle 2006 107 in the years that followed the creation of anarky both norm breyfogle and alan grant experienced changes in their personal and professional lives which they attributed to that collaboration each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding in particular their time developing the anarky series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate discussion and mutual respect 5 6 107 108 109 over time anarky emerged as each man s favorite character with grant wishing he could emulate the character 5 26 110 and remarking that anarky in gotham city was the most personal story he had ever written and the foremost among his three favorite stories he had ever written for the batman mythos 111 of breyfogle grant complimented that the former draws anarky as if he loves the character 58 while breyfogle acknowledged that anarky was his favorite of the creations they collaborated on 28 he felt that his own appreciation was not as great as grant s commenting that anarky was alan s baby 109 with the cancellation of the anarky series and the eventual departure of each artist from dc comics first by grant followed by breyfogle their mutual career paths split and anarky entered into a period of obscurity during this period breyfogle came to suspect that the treatment each man and anarky had received from their former employer was suspect 6 while acknowledging that he lacked evidence he held a nagging feeling that he and grant had each been blacklisted from dc comics as a result of the controversial views expressed in the anarky series second volume 108 while professing that anarky was the character for whom he was proudest and that the character s narratives were among his best achievements for the amount of reaction they generated among readers the character was also a source of some regret for grant reflecting on his early secret plan to transform lonnie machin into a new robin grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of tim drake he occasionally experiences twinges of regret that anarky wasn t chosen as the new sidekick for comics greatest hero 111 grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of anarky following his termination from dc comics and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of anarky and other characters he had come to care about he often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or as he felt were mismanaged 32 37 grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of anarky if you create something that s close to your heart and you don t own it oh woe is me 1 in 2011 dc comics initiated a special dc retroactive series of comics exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters both grant and breyfogle were invited to participate and collaborated to reproduce a story in the style of their classic batman shadow of the bat series grant chose to author a story featuring the ventriloquist however he had been tempted to author a story featuring anarky only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what had become of anarky s canonical status at the time 112 as anarky was created while grant and breyfogle were operating under work for hire rules dc comics owns all rights to the anarky character following the cancellation of the anarky series both men attempted to buy the rights to anarky from the company but their offer was declined 3 5 readership reaction edit my character anarky a 15 year old vigilante kid tried to put anarchist values into action he s immensely popular or at least he was in countries like mexico peru chile and argentina where comic fans were able to empathize with his ethos a lot more than americans did alan grant 2013 80 when an interviewer commented that anarky was popular among fans in 2003 in the midst of the character s period of obscurity norm breyfogle offered a caveat well in certain segments of the comic book industry i suppose breyfogle continued it has some diehard fans but dc doesn t seem to want to do anything with him maybe it s because of his anti authoritarian philosophy a very touchy subject in today s world 31 the sense that anarky is appreciated by certain fans is one shared by alan grant who noted that the character s stories routinely generated more reader mail than any other he wrote 111 commenting on the popularity of the anarky series grant acknowledged the failure of the series but pointed out that it was very popular among some readers it wasn t terribly popular in the states although i received quite a few letters especially from philosophy students saying the comic had changed their entire mindset but anarky was very popular in south america where people have had a long and painful taste of totalitarianism in a way the us is just entering 3 sales of the anarky limited series were high enough to green light an ongoing series 67 with breyfogle commenting it did well enough so that dc is willing to listen to alan s idea for a sequel if we wanted to pitch them 113 despite the sales grant was still concerned the character lacked enough support among fans to sustain an ongoing series 31 while the ongoing series did find an audience amongst latin american nations mexico and argentina in particular it failed in the united states where alan grant has lamented that the comic was doomed to eventual cancellation as dc comics doesn t take foreign sales into consideration when counting their cash 5 acknowledging the failure of the ongoing anarky series grant has conceded that its themes in particular his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind likely resulted in plummeting sales 5 breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series failure breyfogle wrote at the time anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not quite so mainstream this title may have experienced exactly what every half breed suffers rejection by both groups with which it claims identity 114 besides the themes commentators have also found the escalation of anarky s skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers one critic for fanzing an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professisonals wrote i liked the original concept behind anarky a teenage geek who reads the will to power one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world but the minute he wound up getting 100 million in a swiss bank account owning a building impressing darkseid sic getting a boom tube and was shown as being able to outsmart batman outhack oracle and generally be invincible i lost all interest i had in the character 92 in 2014 comic book resources held an informal poll which asked readers to vote for the best characters within the batman franchise in celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 1939 creation of the caped crusader anarky was placed at no 31 among the best villains coming nearly 25 years after the character s own creation 115 political analysis and relevance edit anarky is a direct contrast to batman he is an active agent of change while batman is simply a reactive agent reinforcing the status quo as all corporate superheroes do greg burgas 2006 116 the philosophical nature of the character has invited political critiques and resulted in comparisons drawn against the political and philosophical views of other fictional characters of the various positive analyses drawn from anarky two points which are continuously touched upon by critics are that anarky is among the most unusual of batman s rogue gallery and that his challenge to the ideologies of superheroes is his best feature the authors of i m not fooled by that cheap disguise a 1991 essay deconstructing the batman mythos refer to anarky as a challenge to batman s social and political world view and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a batman adventure as the batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights the invitation to readers to identify with batman s vigilantism is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism the authors summarize that position as the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary short of death the authors commented that anarky potentially redefines crime and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised which batman can not utterly condemn the authors also said that the creation of anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards self conscious awareness of the batman s hegemonic function questioning the most central component of the batman s identity the nature of crime and his relation to it however the authors remained skeptical of anarky s commercial nature pointing out anarky could be incorporated as another marketing technique the contradictions of capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits 117 with the publication in 2005 of an issue of green arrow in which anarky guest starred writer james peaty juxtaposed anarky s radical philosophy with the liberal progressive beliefs of green arrow everyone always goes on about what a radical ollie is and i wanted to show that maybe that isn t the case especially as ollie s radical credentials are pretty antiquated anarky as a character and as a broader idea is much more radical than ollie 34 greg burgas of comic book resources critiqued anarky as one of the more interesting characters of the past fifteen or twenty years because of what he wants to accomplish comparing the nature of anarky as a change agent against batman he is able to show how ineffective batman is against the real problems of society and although batman stops his spree we find ourselves sympathizing much more with anarky than with the representative of the status quo 116 anarky s appearance in batman arkham origins included a speech delivered at the conclusion of the character s story arch the player is given the opportunity to observe anarky after he has been defeated and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society tries to reconcile his admiration for batman and ultimately denounces the caped crusader as a false hero nick dinicola of popmatters in comparing the game to its predecessor batman arkham city asserted that the narrative of origins consistently challenged batman s ideological reasons for acting as he does whereas city uncritically took his motivations as a given anarky s wonderful speech takes batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism considering that batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear anarky is equating the rise of batman with the downfall of society dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like anarky to scrutinize batman s heroism rather than simply assert it allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold batman as a heroic figure in a way city could not to dinicola this validated the act of challenging a superhero s traditional interpretation in service to the story 118 in batman and philosophy an analysis of various philosophies which intersect with the batman mythos anarky s critique of the state is compared favorably to that of friedrich nietzsche the nietzschean state constitutes a new idol one that is no less repressive than its predecessors as it defines good and evil for and hangs a sword and a hundred appetites over the faithful no batman villain sees this as clearly as anarky however anarky s behavior was also interpreted as an attempt to impose an even more restrictive order with examples presented from batman anarky in which lonnie machin lectures fellow juvenile detainees in tomorrow belongs to us explains his motivations in a self righteous farewell letter to his parents in anarky and creates a fantasy dystopia in a distorted reflection of his desired society in metamorphosis his anarky s search for an organizing principle that is less repressive than the state fails this is sharply compared with batman described as moderating his impulses towards social control 119 dialogue from detective comics is employed in which batman compares himself to anarky and denies the latter legitimacy the fact is no man can be allowed to set himself up as judge jury and executioner 29 far less favorable views of anarky have also been offered newsarama contributor george marston was especially scathing of the character s politics and costume placing anarky at no 8 on a list of the top 10 worst batman villains of all time deriding the character as a living embodiment of an avril lavigne t shirt he pointed out the pointlessness of being inspired to super heroics by radical philosophy and the contradictory nature of fighting crime as an anarchist he concluded by referring to the anarky series as proof that bad decisions are timeless 120 similarly cracked contributor henrik magnusson listed anarky s debut at no 3 on a list of 5 disastrous attempts at political commentary in comic books magnusson s scorn focused on anarky s speeches which he derided as pedantic and laden with pseudo philosophical catchphrases referring to the original identity of lonnie machin as a naive pre teen magnusson considered this fine satire of base level philosophy and teen rebellion on the other hand the understanding that grant had intended anarky to be a vehicle for his personal views and that the anarky in gotham city narrative describes batman as sympathetic to his goals if not his methods upset magnusson 121 i think anarky s age is right now he looks like a street protester he looks like anonymous he s like one of these guys who wants to go out there and change the world to what he believes is the better and i think of all the batman enemies and one of the reasons i m most excited about anarky is he feels relevant today eric holmes 2013 105 several global events of the early 2010s included the rise of hacktivist groups such as anonymous and lulzsec large scale protest movements including the arab spring occupy movement and quebec student protests the crypto anarchist activity on the part of defense distributed and cody wilson and the various information leaks to wikileaks by chelsea manning the stratfor email leak by anonymous and jeremy hammond and the global surveillance disclosures by edward snowden the rapid succession of these events led some media commentators to insist that anarky s relevance as a character had dramatically increased and recommended that the character receive a higher profile in media 45 116 122 123 124 125 this sentiment led the creative team that developed batman arkham origins to include anarky in the game describing anarky s anti government and anti corporate agenda holmes acknowledged the relevance of anarchism in the contemporary protest movements of the time as a factor in the choice to include the character in the game and to update his appearance to that of a street protester with a gang resembling a social movement 21 holmes stressed in one interview in the real world this is anarky s moment right now today 21 even as early as 2005 james peaty recommended that anarky should be included in more publications in the midst of the ongoing war on terror stating anarky is a terrorist how can that not be interesting in the modern climate 34 anarchist critique edit anarky does represent the anarchist philosophy his whole point of existing is rolled up in his name it s a philosophy of responsibility and freedom from the hierarchical power sic norm breyfogle 1999 27 critics have commented on the character s depiction as an anarchist since his first appearance according to alan grant anarchists with whom he associated were angered by his creation of the character seeing it as an act of recuperation for commercial gain 110 neither grant nor breyfogle could fully agree with this criticism as grant put it i thought i was doing them a favour you know 1 in the years following the anarky publications of the late 1990s more receptive critiques have been offered in assessing the presentation of anarchist philosophy in fiction mark leier the director for the centre for labour studies from simon fraser university cited anarky as an example of the favorable treatment anarchist philosophy has occasionally received in mainstream comic books leier took particular note of quotations derived from the dialogue in anarky in gotham city story in which batman speaks positively of anarky s intentions 126 following the cancellation of the ongoing series roderick t long an anarchist libertarian political commentator and senior scholar at the ludwig von mises institute praised anarky as an impressive voice for liberty in today s comics 127 margaret killjoy s examination of anarchist fiction mythmakers lawbreakers afforded alan grant and anarky brief mention explaining the relationship grant had with anarchism killjoy reviewed the characters early incarnations as quite wonderful 128 greg burgas in reviewing the career of alan grant specifically cited anarky s anarchist

ʿezrāʾīl is the angel of death in some abrahamic religions namely islam and some traditions of judaism 3 he is also referenced in sikhism 4 relative to similar concepts of such beings azrael holds a rather benevolent role as god s angel of death he acts as a psychopomp responsible for transporting the souls of the deceased after their death 5 both in islam and in judaism he is said to hold a scroll concerning the fate of mortals recording and erasing their names at their birth and death respectively 6 7 234 depending on the perspective and precepts of the various religions in which he is a figure he may also be portrayed as a resident of the third heaven a division of heaven in judaism and islam 8 in islam he is one of the four archangels and is identified with the quranic malak al mawt ملك الموت angel of death which corresponds with the hebrew language term mal akh ha maweth מלאך המוות in rabbinic literature in hebrew azrael translates to angel of god or help from god 8

appendix 5 1 notes 5 2 references etymology in judaism edit the name azrael indicates a hebrew language origin and archeological evidence found in jewish settlements in mesopotamia confirm that it was indeed used in aramaic incantation texts from the 7th century 9 however as the text only lists names it cannot be determined whether azrael was associated with death before the advent of islam after the emergence of islam the name azrael becomes popular among both jewish and islamic literature as well as folklore the name spelled as ezrā ël appears in the ethiopic version of apocalypse of peter

glossary islam portalvte along with jibrail mīkhā īl and isrāfīl azrael is one of the four major archangels in islam 11 he is responsible for taking the souls of the deceased away from the body 12 13 azrael does not act independently but is only informed by god when time is up to take a soul 14 in quran its exegesis edit surah 32 11 mentions an angel of death identified with azrael 15 when the unbelievers in hell cry out for help an angel also identified with azrael will appear on the horizon and tell them that they have to remain 16 other quranic verses refer to a multitude of angels of death according to exegesis these verses refer to lesser angels of death subordinative to azrael who aid the archangel in his duty tafsir al baydawi mentions an entire host of angels of death subordinative to azrael 17 several modern contemporary such as wahbah al zuhayli and scholars from islamic university of madinah indonesian religious ministry saudi islamic affair ministry and masjid al haram has compiled the classical exegesis from chapter al anfal verse 50 quran 8 50 that the angel of death has special tasks during the battle of badr 18 in hadiths its exegesis edit according to one muslim tradition 40 days before the death of a person approaches god drops a leaf from a tree below the heavenly throne on which azrael reads the name of the person he must take with him 13 al qurtubi narrated commentary from classical scholar ibn zhafar al wa izh that azrael has a shape resembling a blue colored ram has numerous eyes in numerous places and according to ikrimah mawlâ ibn abbâs id ar tabi un scholar the size of azrael were so huge that if the earth were put on his shoulder it would be like a bean in an open field 19 he also had 4 000 wings which consisted of two types wings of grace and wings of punishment 19 the wings of punishment are made from iron rods hooks and scissors 19 muqatil ibn sulayman has recorded his commentary in his commentary work as suluk the angel possessed 70 000 foot limbs 20 notes 1 umar ibn abd al aziz a caliph of umayyad dynasty has reported a narration that the angel of death malak al mawt has armed with flaming whip 19 caliph umar also reported a narration that the angel of death was so huge that even he dwarfed bearers of the throne group of angels which are known as the biggest among angels 19 the islamic book of dead describes him with 4 faces and his whole body consists of eyes and tongues whose number corresponds to the number of humans inhabiting the earth 6 8 31 relationship between azrael and death edit islam elaborated further narratives concerning the relation between azrael and death christian lange mentioned that according to some scholars azrael and death were one entity other exegesis scholars opined azrael and death were different entities with death as some kind of tool used by azrael to take life 32 129 one account explains death and its relation to azrael representing death and azrael as former two separate entities but when god created death god ordered the angels to look upon it and they swoon for a thousand years after the angels regained consciousness death recognized that it must submit to azrael 33 the identification of death and angel azrael as one entity were explained in a hadith about the fate of death entity itself after the judgment day where classical hanafite scholar badr al din al ayni has interpreted in that hadith which compiled in sahih bukhari collection that death would take on the form of a ram then placed between paradise and hell and finally slaughtered by god himself causing death cease to exist which followed by god to declare to both people of paradise and hell that eternity has begun and their state will never end 34 lange mentioned that according to some scholars the ram in that hadith narration is no other than the angel of death himself while others assert this to be death s own form in the hereafter 32 in other account sourced from muqatil ibn sulayman azrael and death were said as one entity as he reported the angel has number of faces and hands equal to the number of living creatures on his body where each of those faces and hands are connected with the life of each souls in the living world 20 whenever a face within azrael body vanished then the soul which connected with it will experience death 20 furthermore related interpretation from several groups of modern islamic scholars from imam mohammad ibn saud islamic university in yemen and mauritania has issued fatwa that taken the interpretation from ibn kathir regarding quran chapter al an am verse 61 and a hadith transmitted by abu hurairah and ibn abbas that the angel of death has assisting angels who helped him taking souls 35 the eighth umayyad caliph umar ibn abd al aziz once reported the commentary regarding azrael in quran chapter as sajdah verse 11 quran 32 11 that taking many lives are very easy for the angel that in caliph s words it as if the entire mankind on earth were only like dish on the plate from the perspective of malak al mawt angel of death 19 meanwhile al qurtubi has narrated from the authority of mujahid ibn jabr that the world being between the hands of the angel of death is similar to a vessel between the hands of a human he takes from whatever place he wants where mujahid described that azrael is able to seize many souls at the same moment because god made the earth shrunk for him until it seems as if it is a vessel between his hands 35 a similar marfu hadith i e with an elevated chain of transmission was reported by zuhayr ibn muhammad 35 in folklore edit azrael kept his importance in everyday life according to the sufi teacher al jili azrael appears to the soul in a form provided by its most powerful metaphors a common belief holds that the lesser angels of death are for the common people while saints and prophets meet the archangel of death himself 17 great prophets such as moses and muhammad are invited politely by him but saints are also said to meet azrael in beautiful forms it is said that when rumi was about to die he laid in his bed and met azrael in human shape 36 the belief that azrael appears to saints before they actually die to prepare themselves for death is also attested by the testament of nasir khusraw in which he claims to have met azrael during his sleep informing him about his upcoming death 37 according to another famous narrative which recorded by ibn kathir in his work qishaash al anbiya story of the prophets god once ordered gabriel mikael israfil and azrael to collect dust from earth from which adam is supposed to be created only azrael succeeded whereupon he was destined to become the angel concerning life and death of humanity 38 western reception edit the islamic notion of azrael including some narratives such as the tale of solomon a hadith reaching back to shahr ibn hawshab 39 was already known in america in the 18th century as attested by gregory sharpe and james harris 39 some western adaptions extended the physical description of azrael hence the poet leigh hunt depicts azrael as wearing a black hooded cloak although lacking the eminent scythe his portrayal nevertheless resembles the grim reaper 39 henry wadsworth longfellow mentions azrael in the reaper and the flowers as an angel of death but he is not equated with samael the angel of death in jewish lore who appears as a fallen and malevolent angel instead 40 azrael also appears in g k chesterton s poem lepanto as one of the islamic spirits commanded by mahound muhammad to resist don john of austria s crusade in the smurfs the cat of the evil wizard gargamel is called azrael see also edit wikimedia commons has media related to azrael angels in islam azriel

criticised his theology ibn al mubarak d 181 h 797 ce who criticised his methodology particularly that he did not quote hadith with chains of transmission and wakee ibn al jarrah d 197 812 ce who criticize muqatil as lying in his narration 21 22 23 ibn hajar in particular quotes the following from him two disgusting opinions came to us from the east jahm the negator of god s attributes and muqatil the anthropomorphist 24 ibn rajab al hanbali stated that the early scholars as salaf rejected muqatil s views after they became known after his debate with jahm 25 26 however more recent scholars has argued while muqatil are not trustworthy his theology as antrophomorphist are falsely attributed as ibn abi al izz d 731 a follower of ibn taymiyyah 27 argued that al ash ari s material originated from the mu tazila and or must have been tampered with 28 29 contemporary saudi scholar abdullah al ghunayman author of the commentary on ibn taymiyyah s al aqidah al waasitiyyah argues that he could not find anything he would consider anthropomorphic from muqatil arguing that to be reliable ones views must be taken from one s own works and not from the works of an opponent al ghunayman says mushabbih has become a catch word to accuse one s opponents because of their different views 30 29 references edit smith elise lawton 2002 evelyn pickering de morgan and the allegorical

denoting the depicted persons are written in an archaic form of the greek alphabet perseus greek περϻευϻ is inscribed as ϻvεϻρεπ from right to left using v to represent the vowel u san ϻ is used instead of sigma σ the letter v ultimately comes from the phoenician letter waw by way of u see u for details during the late middle ages two minuscule glyphs of u developed which were both used for sounds including u and modern v the pointed form v was written at the beginning of a word while a rounded form u was used in the middle or end regardless of sound so whereas valour and excuse appeared as in modern printing have and upon were printed as haue and vpon the first distinction between the letters u and v is recorded in a gothic script from 1386 where v preceded u by the mid 16th century the v form was used to represent the consonant and u the vowel sound giving us the modern letter v u and v were not accepted as distinct letters until many years later 2 the rounded variant became the modern day version of u and the letter s former pointed form became v letter edit in the international phonetic alphabet v represents the voiced labiodental fricative see help ipa in english special rules of orthography normally apply to the letter v traditionally v is not doubled to indicate a short vowel the way for example p is doubled to indicate the difference between super and supper however that is changing with newly coined words such as savvy divvy up and skivvies words that ends in a v sound except of normally spell that sound ve regardless of the pronunciation of the vowel before it this rule does not apply to transliterations of slavic and hebrew words such as kiev or to words that started out as abbreviations such as sov for sovereign the short u sound is spelled o not u before the letter v this originated with a mediaeval scribal practice designed to increase legibility by avoiding too many vertical strokes minims in a row like j k q x and z v is not used very

relief remorse resentment sadness saudade schadenfreude self pity shame shock shyness social connection sorrow suffering surprise suspicion trust wonder worry vte anger also known as wrath or rage is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and non cooperative response to a perceived provocation hurt or threat 1 2 a person experiencing anger will often experience physical effects such as increased heart rate elevated blood pressure and increased levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline 3 some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the fight or flight response 4 anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally cognitively and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force 5 the english word originally comes from the term anger from the old norse language 6 anger can have many physical and mental consequences the external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions body language physiological responses and at times public acts of aggression facial expressions can range from inward angling of the eyebrows to a full frown 7 while most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of what has happened to them psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self monitoring capacity and objective observability 8 modern psychologists view anger as a normal natural and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times and as something that has functional value for survival uncontrolled anger can negatively affect personal or social well being 8 9 and negatively impact those around them while many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger 10 the issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers but modern psychologists in contrast to earlier writers have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger 10 contents 1 psychology and sociology 1 1 neuropsychological perspective 2 differences between related concepts 3 characteristics 3 1 passive anger 3 2 aggressive anger 3 3 assertive anger 3 4 six dimensions of anger expression 3 5 ethnicity and culture 4 causes 5 cognitive effects 6 expressive strategies 7 coping strategies 7 1 therapy and behavioral strategies 7 2 medication therapy 7 3 suppression 8 dual threshold model 9 physiology 10

see also 14 references 14 1 further reading 14 1 1 books 14 1 2 articles psychology and sociology edit the anger of achilles by giovanni battista tiepolo depicts the greek hero attacking agamemnon three types of anger are recognized by psychologists 11 hasty and sudden anger is connected to the impulse for self preservation it is shared by human and other animals and it occurs when the animal feels tormented or trapped this form of anger is episodic settled and deliberate anger is a reaction to perceived deliberate harm or unfair treatment by others this form of anger is episodic dispositional anger is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions irritability sullenness and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors promotion of social justice communication of negative sentiment and redress of grievances it can also facilitate patience in contrast anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression anger in its strong form impairs one s ability to process information and to exert cognitive control over one s behavior an angry person may lose their objectivity empathy prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to themselves or others 8 12 13 there is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression verbal or physical direct or indirect even though they mutually influence each other while anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression 8 neuropsychological perspective edit extension of the stimuli of the fighting reactions at the beginning of life the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines their movements there is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli as distinct from other stimulation in anger at a later date the child learns that certain actions such as striking scolding and screaming are effective toward persons but not toward things in adults though the infantile response is still sometimes seen the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence 14 differences between related concepts edit raymond novaco of university of california irvine who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject stratified anger into three modalities cognitive appraisals somatic affective tension and agitations and behavioral withdrawal and antagonism 15 the words annoyance and rage are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury or murderous rage at the high end rage problems are conceptualized as the inability to process emotions or life s experiences 16 either because the capacity to regulate emotion schore 1994 17 has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma rage is understood as raw undifferentiated emotions that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed no matter how trivial puts more stress on the organism than it can bear anger when viewed as a protective response or instinct to a perceived threat is considered as positive the negative expression of this state is known as aggression 18 acting on this misplaced state is rage due to possible potential errors in perception and judgment examples expressions of anger used negatively reasoning over protective instinct and hostility to avoid conceived loss or fear that something will be taken away entitlement and frustration to prevent a change in functioning intimidation and rationalization to meet one s own needs characteristics edit william defoore an anger management writer described anger as a pressure cooker stating that we can only suppress or apply pressure against our happy for so long before it erupts 19 one simple dichotomy of anger expression is passive anger versus aggressive anger versus assertive anger these three types of anger have some characteristic symptoms 20 passive anger edit passive anger can be expressed in the following ways 21 dispassion such as giving someone the cold shoulder or a fake smile looking unconcerned or sitting on the fence while others sort things out dampening feelings with substance abuse overreacting oversleeping not responding to another s anger frigidity indulging in sexual practices that depress spontaneity and make objects of participants giving inordinate amounts of time to machines objects or intellectual pursuits talking of frustrations but showing no feeling evasiveness such as turning one s back in a crisis avoiding conflict not arguing back becoming phobic defeatism such as setting people up for failure choosing unreliable people to depend on being accident prone underachieving sexual impotence expressing frustration at insignificant things but ignoring serious ones obsessive behavior such as needing to be inordinately clean and tidy making a habit of constantly checking things over dieting or overeating demanding that all jobs be done perfectly psychological manipulation such as provoking people to aggression and then patronizing them provoking aggression but staying on the sidelines emotional blackmail false tearfulness feigning illness sabotaging relationships using sexual provocation using a third party to convey negative feelings withholding money or resources secretive behavior such as stockpiling resentments that are expressed behind people s backs giving the silent treatment or under the breath mutterings avoiding eye contact putting people down gossiping anonymous complaints poison pen letters stealing and conning self blame such as apologizing too often being overly critical inviting criticism aggressive anger edit the symptoms of aggressive anger are bullying such as threatening people directly persecuting insulting pushing or shoving using power to oppress shouting driving someone off the road playing on people s weaknesses destruction such as destroying objects as in vandalism harming animals child abuse destroying a relationship reckless driving substance abuse grandiosity such as showing off expressing mistrust not delegating being a sore loser wanting center stage all the time not listening talking over people s heads expecting kiss and make up sessions to solve problems hurtfulness

making general accusations unpredictability such as explosive rages over minor frustrations attacking indiscriminately dispensing unjust punishment inflicting harm on others for the sake of it 22 illogical arguments vengeance such as being over punitive this differs from retributive justice as vengeance is personal and possibly unlimited in scale assertive anger edit blame such as after a particular individual commits an action that s possibly frowned upon the particular person will resort to scolding this is in fact common in discipline terms punishment the angry person will give a temporary punishment to an individual like further limiting a child s will to do anything they want like playing video games reading excluding schoolwork etc after they did something to cause trouble sternness such as calling out a person on their behaviour with their voices raised with utter disapproval disappointment six dimensions of anger expression edit anger expression can take on many more styles than passive or aggressive ephrem fernandez has identified six dimensions of anger expression they relate to the direction of anger its locus reaction modality impulsivity and objective coordinates on each of these dimensions can be connected to generate a profile of a person s anger expression style among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system are the familiar profile of the person with explosive anger profile of the person with repressive anger profile of the passive aggressive person and the profile of constructive anger expression 23 ethnicity and culture edit much research has explored whether the emotion of anger is experienced and expressed differently depending on the culture matsumoto 2007 conducted a study in which white american and asian participants needed to express the emotions from a program called jacfee japanese and caucasian facial expression of emotion in order to determine whether caucasian observers noticed any differences in expression of participants of a different nationality he found that participants were unable to assign a nationality to people demonstrating expression of anger i e they could not distinguish ethnic specific expressions of anger 24 hatfield rapson and le 2009 conducted a study that measured ethnic differences in emotional expression using participants from the philippines hawaii china and europe they concluded that there was a difference between how someone expresses an emotion especially the emotion of anger in people with different ethnicities based on frequency with europeans showing the lowest frequency of expression of negative emotions 25 other research investigates anger within different ethnic groups who live in the same country researchers explored whether black americans experience and express greater anger than whites mabry kiecolt 2005 they found that after controlling for sex and age black participants did not feel or express more anger than whites 26 deffenbacher and swaim 1999 compared the expression of anger in mexican american people and white non hispanic american people they concluded that white non hispanic americans expressed more verbal aggression than mexican americans although when it came to physical aggression expressions there was no significant difference between both cultures when it came to anger 27 causes edit some animals make loud sounds attempt to look physically larger bare their teeth and stare 28 the behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants 28 displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence 29 30 people feel really angry when they sense that they or someone they care about has been offended when they are certain about the nature and cause of the angering event when they are convinced someone else is responsible and when they feel they can still influence the situation or cope with it 31 for instance if a person s car is damaged they will feel angry if someone else did it e g another driver rear ended it but will feel sadness instead if it was caused by situational forces e g a hailstorm or guilt and shame if they were personally responsible e g they crashed into a wall out of momentary carelessness psychotherapist michael c graham defines anger in terms of our expectations and assumptions about the world 32 graham states anger almost always results when we are caught up expecting the world to be different than it is 33 usually those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of what has happened to them and in most cases the described provocations occur immediately before the anger experience such explanations confirm the illusion that anger has a discrete external cause the angry person usually finds the cause of their anger in an intentional personal and controllable aspect of another person s behavior this explanation is based on the intuitions of the angry person who experiences a loss in self monitoring capacity and objective observability as a result of their emotion anger can be of multicausal origin some of which may be remote events but people rarely find more than one cause for their anger 8 according to novaco anger experiences are embedded or nested within an environmental temporal context disturbances that may not have involved anger at the outset leave residues that are not readily recognized but that operate as a lingering backdrop for focal provocations of anger 8 according to encyclopædia britannica an internal infection can cause pain which in turn can activate anger 34 according to cognitive consistency theory anger is caused by an inconsistency between a desired or expected situation and the actually perceived situation and triggers responses such as aggressive behavior with the expected consequence of reducing the inconsistency 35 36 37 cognitive effects edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed march 2013 learn how and when to remove this template message anger causes a reduction in cognitive ability and the accurate processing of external stimuli dangers seem smaller actions seem less risky ventures seem more likely to succeed and unfortunate events seem less likely angry people are more likely to make risky decisions and make less realistic risk assessments in one study test subjects primed to feel angry felt less likely to have heart disease and more likely to receive a pay raise compared to fearful people 38 this tendency can manifest in retrospective thinking as well in a 2005 study angry subjects said they thought the risks of terrorism in the year following 9 11 in retrospect were low compared to what the fearful and neutral subjects thought 39 in inter group relationships anger makes people think in more negative and prejudiced terms about outsiders anger makes people less trusting and slower to attribute good qualities to outsiders 40 when a group is in conflict with a rival group it will feel more anger if it is the politically stronger group and less anger when it is the weaker 41 unlike other negative emotions like sadness and fear angry people are more likely to demonstrate correspondence bias the tendency to blame a person s behavior more on his nature than on his circumstances they tend to rely more on stereotypes and pay less attention to details and more attention to the superficial in this regard anger is unlike other negative emotions such as sadness and fear which promote analytical thinking 42 an angry person tends to anticipate other events that might cause them anger they will tend to rate anger causing events e g being sold a faulty car as more likely than sad events e g a good friend moving away 43 a person who is angry tends to place more blame on another person for their misery this can create a feedback as this extra blame can make the angry person angrier still so they in turn place yet more blame on the other person when people are in a certain emotional state they tend to pay more attention to or remember things that are charged with the same emotion so it is with anger for instance if a person is trying to persuade someone that a tax increase is necessary if the person is currently feeling angry they would do better to use an argument that elicits anger more criminals will escape justice than say an argument that elicits sadness there will be fewer welfare benefits for disabled children 44 also unlike other negative emotions which focus attention on all negative events anger only focuses attention on anger causing events anger can make a person more desiring of an object to which his anger is tied in a 2010 dutch study test subjects were primed to feel anger or fear by being shown an image of an angry or fearful face and then were shown an image of a random object when subjects were made to feel angry they expressed more desire to possess that object than subjects who had been primed to feel fear 45 expressive strategies edit as with any emotion the display of anger can be feigned or exaggerated studies by hochschild and sutton have shown that the show of anger is likely to be an effective manipulation strategy in order to change and design attitudes anger is a distinct strategy of social influence and its use e g belligerent behaviors as a goal achievement mechanism proves to be a successful strategy 29 30 larissa tiedens known for her studies of anger claimed that expression of feelings would cause a powerful influence not only on the perception of the expresser but also on their power position in the society she studied the correlation between anger expression and social influence perception previous researchers such as keating 1985 have found that people with angry face expression were perceived as powerful and as in a high social position 49 similarly tiedens et al have revealed that people who compared scenarios involving an angry and a sad character attributed a higher social status to the angry character 50 tiedens examined in her study whether anger expression promotes status attribution in other words whether anger contributes to perceptions or legitimization of others behaviors her findings clearly indicated that participants who were exposed to either an angry or a sad person were inclined to express support for the angry person rather than for a sad one in addition it was found that a reason for that decision originates from the fact that the person expressing anger was perceived as an ability owner and was attributed a certain social status accordingly 49 showing anger during a negotiation may increase the ability of the anger expresser to succeed in negotiation a study by tiedens et al indicated that the anger expressers were perceived as stubborn dominant and powerful in addition it was found that people were inclined to easily give up to those who were perceived by them as powerful and stubborn rather than soft and submissive 50 based on these findings sinaceur and tiedens have found that people conceded more to the angry side rather than for the non angry one 51 a question raised by van kleef et al based on these findings was whether expression of emotion influences others since it is known that people use emotional information to conclude about others limits and match their demands in negotiation accordingly van kleef et al wanted to explore whether people give up more easily to an angry opponent or to a happy opponent findings revealed that participants tended to be more flexible toward an angry opponent compared with a happy opponent these results strengthen the argument that participants analyze the opponent s emotion to conclude about their limits and carry out their decisions accordingly 52 coping strategies edit main article anger management therapy and behavioral strategies edit according to leland r beaumont each instance of anger demands making a choice 53 a person can respond with hostile action including overt violence or they can respond with hostile inaction such as withdrawing or stonewalling other options include initiating a dominance contest harboring resentment or working to better understand and constructively resolve the issue according to raymond novaco there are a multitude of steps that were researched in attempting to deal with this emotion in order to manage anger the problems involved in the anger should be discussed novaco suggests the situations leading to anger should be explored by the person 10 54 conventional therapies for anger involve restructuring thoughts and beliefs to bring about a reduction in anger these therapies often come within the schools of cbt or cognitive behavioral therapy like modern systems such as rebt rational emotive behavior therapy research shows that people with excessive anger often harbor and act on dysfunctional attributions assumptions and evaluations in specific situations it has been shown that with therapy by a trained professional individuals can bring their anger to more manageable levels 55 the therapy is followed by the so called stress inoculation in which the clients are taught relaxation skills to control their arousal and various cognitive controls to exercise on their attention thoughts images and feelings logic defeats anger because anger even when it s justified can quickly become irrational american psychological association in other words although there may be a rational reason to get angry the frustrated actions of the subject can become irrational taking deep breaths is regarded as the first step to calming down once the anger has subsided a little the patient will accept that they are frustrated and move on lingering around the source of frustration may bring the rage back 56 the skills deficit model states that poor social skills is what renders a person incapable of expressing anger in an appropriate manner 57 social skills training has been found to be an effective method for reducing exaggerated anger by offering alternative coping skills to the angry individual research has found that persons who are prepared for aversive events find them less threatening and excitatory reactions are significantly reduced 58 in a 1981 study that used modeling behavior rehearsal and videotaped feedback to increase anger control skills showed increases in anger control among aggressive youth in the study 59 research conducted with youthful offenders using a social skills training program aggression replacement training found significant reductions in anger and increases in anger control 60 research has also found that antisocial personalities are more likely to learn avoidance tasks when the consequences involved obtaining or losing tangible rewards learning among antisocial personalities also occurred better when they were involved with high intensity stimulation 61 social learning theory states that positive stimulation was not compatible with hostile or aggressive reactions 62 anger research has also studied the effects of reducing anger among adults with antisocial personality disorder aspd with a social skills program approach that used a low fear and high arousal group setting this research found that low fear messages were less provocative to the aspd population and high positive arousal stimulated their ability to concentrate and subsequently learn new skills for anger reduction 63 a new integrative approach to anger treatment has been formulated by fernandez 2010 64 termed cbat for cognitive behavioral affective therapy this treatment goes beyond conventional relaxation and reappraisal by adding cognitive and behavioral techniques and supplementing them with effective techniques to deal with the feeling of anger the techniques are sequenced contingently in three phases of treatment prevention intervention and postvention in this way people can be trained to deal with the onset of anger its progression and the residual features of anger medication therapy edit systematic reviews and meta analyses suggest that certain psychiatric medications may be effective in controlling symptoms of anger hostility and irritability 65 66 67 68 69 70 these include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssri antidepressants like sertraline certain anticonvulsant mood stabilizers antipsychotics like aripiprazole risperidone and olanzapine and benzodiazepines like midazolam among others 65 68 67 69 66 70 another meta analysis of antidepressants and aggression found no change in aggression in adults and increased aggression in children 71 psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamines as well as the atypical antipsychotic risperidone are useful in reducing aggression and oppositionality in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd with moderate to large effect sizes and greater effectiveness than other studied medications 72 73 yet another meta analysis found that methylphenidate slightly reduced irritability while amphetamines increased the risk of irritability several fold in children with adhd 74 suppression edit modern psychologists point out that suppression of anger may have harmful effects the suppressed anger may find another outlet such as a physical symptom or become more extreme 10 75 john w fiero cites los angeles riots of 1992 as an example of sudden explosive release of suppressed anger the anger was then displaced as violence against those who had nothing to do with the matter there is also the case of francine hughes who suffered 13 years of domestic abuse her suppressed anger drove her to kill her abuser husband it is claimed that a majority of female victims of domestic violence who suppress their aggressive feelings are unable to recognize experience and process negative emotion and this has a destabilizing influence on their perception of agency in their relationships 76 another example of widespread deflection of anger from its actual cause toward scapegoating fiero says was the blaming of jews for the economic ills of germany by the nazis 9 some psychologists criticized the catharsis theory of aggression which suggests that releasing pent up anger reduces aggression 77 on the other hand there are experts who maintain that suppression does not eliminate anger since it merely forbids the expression of anger and this is also the case for repression which merely hides anger from awareness 78 there are also studies that link suppressed anger and medical conditions such as hypertension coronary artery disease and cancer 79 80 suppressed or repressed anger is found to cause irritable bowel syndrome eating disorders and depression among women 81 80 suppression is also referred to as a form of self silencing which is described as a cognitive activity wherein an individual monitors the self and eliminate thoughts and feelings that are perceived to be dangerous to relationships 80 anger suppression is also associated with higher rates of suicide 80 dual threshold model edit anger expression might have negative outcomes for individuals and organizations as well such as decrease of productivity 82 and increase of job stress 83 it could also have positive outcomes such as increased work motivation improved relationships and increased mutual understanding for ex tiedens 2000 84 a dual threshold model of anger in organizations by geddes and callister 2007 provides an explanation on the valence of anger expression outcomes the model suggests that organizational norms establish emotion thresholds that may be crossed when employees feel anger the first expression threshold is crossed when an organizational member conveys felt anger to individuals at work who are associated with or able to address the anger provoking situation the second impropriety threshold is crossed if or when organizational members go too far while expressing anger such that observers and other company personnel find their actions socially and or culturally inappropriate the higher probability of negative outcomes from workplace anger likely will occur in either of two situations the first is when organizational members suppress rather than express their anger that is they fail to cross the expression threshold in this instance personnel who might be able to address or resolve the anger provoking condition or event remain unaware of the problem allowing it to continue along with the affected individual s anger the second is when organizational members cross both thresholds double cross displaying anger that is perceived as deviant in such cases the angry person is seen as the problem increasing chances of organizational sanctions against him or her while diverting attention away from the initial anger provoking incident in contrast a higher probability of positive outcomes from workplace anger expression likely will occur when one s expressed anger stays in the space between the expression and impropriety thresholds here one expresses anger in a way fellow organizational members find acceptable prompting exchanges and discussions that may help resolve concerns to the satisfaction of all parties involved this space between the thresholds varies among different organizations and also can be changed in organization itself when the change is directed to support anger displays the space between the thresholds will be expanded and when the change is directed to suppressing such displays the space will be reduced 85 86 physiology edit an angry exchange between two people as evidenced by their body language and facial expressions to hear the angry exchange listen to the audio below audio file of an angry exchange at a protest neuroscience has shown that emotions are generated by multiple structures in the brain the rapid minimal and evaluative processing of the emotional significance of the sensory data is done when the data passes through the amygdala in its travel from the sensory organs along certain neural pathways towards the limbic forebrain emotion caused by discrimination of stimulus features thoughts or memories occurs when its information is relayed from the thalamus to the neocortex 34 based on some statistical analysis some scholars have suggested that the tendency for anger may be genetic distinguishing between genetic and environmental factors requires further research and actual measurement of specific genes and environments 87 88 in neuroimaging studies of anger the most consistently activated region of the brain was the lateral orbitofrontal cortex 89 this region is associated with approach motivation and positive affective processes 90 the external expression of anger can be found in physiological responses facial expressions body language and at times in public acts of aggression 7 the rib cage tenses and breathing through the nose becomes faster deeper and irregular 91 anger activates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis 92 the catecholamine activation is more strongly norepinephrine than epinephrine 8 heart rate and blood pressure increase blood flows to the hands perspiration increases particularly when the anger is intense 93 the face flushes the nostrils flare the jaw tenses the brow muscles move inward and downward fixing a hard stare on the target the arms are raised and a squared off stance is adopted the body is mobilized for immediate action often manifesting as a subjective sense of strength self assurance and potency this may encourage the impulse to strike out 8 measuring anger edit the gallup world poll edit every year gallup asks people in over 140 countries did you experience anger during a lot of the day yesterday in 2021 gallup found that 23 of adults experienced a lot of anger which is up from 18 in 2014 94 the countries that experienced the most anger were lebanon turkey armenia iraq and afghanistan the countries that experience the least anger were finland mauritius estonia portugal and the netherlands 95 philosophical perspectives edit the fury of athamas by john flaxman 1755 1826 ancient history edit ancient greek philosophers describing and commenting on the uncontrolled anger particularly toward slaves in their society generally showed a hostile attitude towards anger galen and seneca regarded anger as a kind of madness they all rejected the spontaneous uncontrolled fits of anger and agreed on both the possibility and value of controlling anger there were disagreements regarding the value of anger for seneca anger was worthless even for war seneca believed that the disciplined roman army was regularly able to beat the germans who were known for their fury he argued that in sporting contests it is a mistake to become angry 10 aristotle on the other hand ascribed some value to anger that has arisen from perceived injustice because it is useful for preventing injustice 10 96 furthermore the opposite of anger is a kind of insensibility aristotle stated 10 the difference in people s temperaments was generally viewed as a result of the different mix of qualities or humors people contained seneca held that red haired and red faced people are hot tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors 10 ancient philosophers rarely refer to women s anger at all according to simon kemp and k t strongman perhaps because their works were not intended for women some of them that discuss it such as seneca considered women to be more prone to anger than men 10 control methods edit wikisource has original text related to this article of anger seneca addresses the question of mastering anger in three parts 1 how to avoid becoming angry in the first place 2 how to cease being angry and 3 how to deal with anger in others 10 seneca suggests to avoid becoming angry in the first place that the many faults of anger should be repeatedly remembered one should avoid being too busy or dealing with anger provoking people unnecessary hunger or thirst should be avoided and soothing music be listened to 10 to cease being angry seneca suggests one to check speech and impulses and be aware of particular sources of personal irritation in dealing with other people one should not be too inquisitive it is not always soothing to hear and see everything when someone appears to slight you you should be at first reluctant to believe this and should wait to hear the full story you should also put yourself in the place of the other person trying to understand his motives and any extenuating factors such as age or illness 10 seneca further advises daily self inquisition about one s bad habit 10 to deal with anger in others seneca suggests that the best reaction is to simply keep calm a certain kind of deception seneca says is necessary in dealing with angry people 10 galen repeats seneca s points but adds a new one finding a guide and teacher can help the person in controlling their passions galen also gives some hints for finding a good teacher 10 both seneca and galen and later philosophers agree that the process of controlling anger should start in childhood on grounds of malleability seneca warns that this education should not blunt the spirit of the children nor should they be humiliated or treated severely at the same time they should not be pampered children seneca says should learn not to beat their playmates and not to become angry with them seneca also advises that children s requests should not be granted when they are angry 10 post classical history edit see also the four humours during the period of the roman empire and the middle ages philosophers elaborated on the existing conception of anger many of whom did not make major contributions to the concept for example many medieval philosophers such as ibn sina avicenna roger bacon and thomas aquinas agreed with ancient philosophers that animals cannot become angry 10 on the other hand al ghazali algazel who often disagreed with aristotle and ibn sina on many issues argued that animals do possess anger as one of the three powers in their heart the other two being appetite and impulse he also argued that animal will is conditioned by anger and appetite in contrast to human will which is conditioned by the intellect 97 a common medieval belief was that those prone to anger had an excess of yellow bile or choler hence the word choleric 10 this belief was related to seneca s belief that red haired and red faced people are hot tempered because of excessive hot and dry humors by gender edit wrath was sinful because of the social problems it caused sometimes even homicide it served to ignore those who are present contradicts those who are absent produces insults and responds harshly to insults that are received 98 aristotle felt that anger or wrath was a natural outburst of self defense in situations where people felt they had been wronged aquinas felt that if anger was justified it was not a sin for example he that is angry without cause shall be in danger but he that is angry with cause shall not be in danger for without anger teaching will be useless judgments unstable crimes unchecked therefore to be angry is not always an evil 99 the concept of wrath contributed to a definition of gender and power many medieval authors in 1200 agreed the differences between men and women were based on complexion shape and disposition complexion involved the balance of the four fundamental qualities of heat coldness moistness and dryness when various combinations of these qualities are made they define groups of certain people as well as individuals hippocrates aristotle and galen all agreed on that in terms of biology and sexual differentiation heat was the most important of the qualities because it determined shape and disposition disposition included a balance of the previous four qualities the four elements and the four humors for example the element of fire shared the qualities of heat and dryness fire dominated in yellow bile or choler meaning a choleric person was more or hot and dry than others hot and dry individuals were active dominant and aggressive the opposite was true with the element of water water is cold and moist related closely to phlegm people with more phlegmatic personalities were passive and submissive while these trait clusters varied from individual to individual most authors in the middle ages assumed certain clusters of traits characterized men more than women and vice versa 100 women edit scholars posted that females were seen by authors in the middle ages to be more phlegmatic cold and wet than males meaning females were more sedentary and passive than males 100 women s passive nature appeared natural due to their lack of power when compared to men aristotle identified traits he believed women shared female feminine passive focused on matter inactive and inferior thus medieval women were supposed to act submissively toward men and relinquish control to their husbands 100 hildegard of bingen believed women were fully capable of anger while most women were phlegmatic individual women under certain circumstances could also be choleric men edit medieval scholars believed most men were choleric or hot and dry thus they were dominant and aggressive barton aristotle also identified characteristics of men male masculine active focused on form potent outstanding and superior men were aware of the power they held given their choleric nature men exhibited hot temperatures and were quick to anger 100 peter of albano once said the male s spirit is lively given to violent impulse it is slow getting angry and slower being calmed medieval ideas of gender assumed men were more rational than women masculinity involved a wide range of possible behaviors and men were not angry all the time every man s humoral balance was different some men were strong others weak also some more prone to wrath then others 100 there are those who view anger as a manly act for instance david brakke maintained because anger motivated a man to action in righting wrongs to himself and others because its opposite appeared to be passivity in the face of challenges from other males because to put it simply it raised the body s temperature anger appeared to be a characteristic of masculinity a sign that a man was indeed a manly man 101 control methods edit maimonides considered being given to uncontrollable passions as a kind of illness like galen maimonides suggested seeking out a philosopher for curing this illness just as one seeks out a physician for curing bodily illnesses roger bacon elaborates seneca s advices many medieval writers discuss at length the evils of anger and the virtues of temperance in a discussion of confession john mirk an english 14th century augustinian writer tells priests how to advise the penitent by considering the spiritual and social consequences of anger 10 agaynes wraþþe hys helpe schal be ʒef he haue grace in herte to se how aungelus when he ys wroth from hym faste flen and goth and fendes faste to hym renneth and wyþ fuyre of helle hys herte breneth and maketh hym so hote hegh þat no mon may byde hym negh 102 against wrath his help shall be if he has grace in heart to see how angels should his anger rise flee fast from him and go and demons run to him in haste hell s fury burns his heart and makes him so hot and high that none may stand him nigh in the canon of medicine ibn sina avicenna modified the theory of temperaments and argued that anger heralded the transition of melancholia to mania and explained that humidity inside the head can contribute to such mood disorders 103 on the other hand ahmed ibn sahl al balkhi classified anger along with aggression as a type of neurosis 104 while al ghazali argued that anger takes form in rage indignation and revenge and that the powers of the soul become balanced if it keeps anger under control 105 modern perspectives edit immanuel kant rejects revenge as vicious regarding the latter david hume argues that because anger and hatred are passions inherent in our very frame and constitution the lack of them is sometimes evidence of weakness and imbecility 11 martha nussbaum has also agreed that even great injustice is no excuse for childish and undisciplined behavior 106 two main differences between the modern understanding and ancient understanding of anger can be detected kemp and strongman state one is that early philosophers were not concerned with possible harmful effects of the suppression of anger the other is that recently studies of anger take the issue of gender differences into account 10 soraya chemaly has in contrast argued that anger is a critically useful and positive emotion which warns us as humans that something is wrong and needs to change when being threatened with indignity physical harm humiliation and unfairness and therefore a powerful force for political good 107 furthermore she argues that women and minorities are not allowed to be angry to the same extent as white men 107 in a similar vein rebecca traister has argued that holding back anger has been an impediment to the progress of women s rights 108 the american psychologist albert ellis has suggested that anger rage and fury partly have roots in the philosophical meanings and assumptions through which human beings interpret transgression 109 according to ellis these emotions are often associated and related to the leaning humans have to absolutistically depreciating and damning other peoples humanity when their personal rules and domain are transgressed religious perspectives edit judaism edit main article anger in judaism in judaism anger is a negative trait in the book of genesis jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons simon and levi cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel 110 restraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable as ethics of the fathers states ben zoma said who is strong he who subdues his evil inclination as it is stated he who is slow to anger is better than a strong man and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city proverbs 16 32 111 maimonides rules that one who becomes angry is as though that person had worshipped idols 112 rabbi shneur zalman of liadi explains that the parallel between anger and idol worship is that by becoming angry one shows a disregard of divine providence whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from above and that through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of god in one s life 113 in its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt the kitzur shulchan aruch states anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs you should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry 114 in modern writing s rabbi harold kushner finds no grounds for anger toward god because our misfortunes are none of his doing 115 in contrast to kushner s reading of the bible david blumenthal finds an abusing god whose sometimes evil actions evoke vigorous protest but without severing the protester s relationship with god 116 christianity edit both catholic and protestant writers have addressed anger in different perspectives catholic edit the seven deadly sins and the four last things by hieronymus bosch 1485 wrath is depicted at the bottom in a series of circular images below the image is the latin inscription cave cave deus videt beware beware god is watching angel with temperance and humility virtues versus devil with rage and wrath sins a fresco from the 1717 saint nicolas orthodox church in cukovets pernik province bulgaria wrath is one of the seven deadly sins in catholicism and yet the catechism of the catholic church states canons 1772 and 1773 that anger is among the passions and that in the passions as movements of the sensitive appetite there is neither good nor evil the neutral act of anger becomes the sin of wrath when it s directed against an innocent person when it s unduly unbending or long lasting or when it desires excessive punishment if anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor it is gravely against charity it is a mortal sin ccc 2302 hatred is the sin of desiring that someone else may suffer misfortune or evil and is a mortal sin when one desires grave harm ccc 2302 03 medieval christianity vigorously denounced wrath as one of the seven cardinal or deadly sins but some christian writers at times regarded the anger caused by injustice as having some value 9 10 saint basil viewed anger as a reprehensible temporary madness 9 joseph f delany in the catholic encyclopedia 1914 defines anger as the desire of vengeance and states that a reasonable vengeance and passion is ethical and praiseworthy vengeance is sinful when it exceeds its limits in which case it becomes opposed to justice and charity for example vengeance upon one who has not deserved it or to a greater extent than it has been deserved or in conflict with the dispositions of law or from an improper motive are all sinful an unduly vehement vengeance is considered a venial sin unless it seriously goes counter to the love of god or of one s neighbor 117 a more positive view of anger is espoused by roman catholic pastoral theologian henri j m nouwen father nouwen points to the spiritual benefits in anger toward god as found in both the old testament and new testament of the bible in the bible says father nouwen it is clear that only by expressing our anger and hatred directly to god will we come to know the fullness of both his love and our freedom 118 georges bernanos illustrates nouwen s position in his novel the diary of a country priest the countess gave birth to the son she had long wanted but the child died she was fiercely angry when the priest called the countess vented her anger toward her daughter and husband then at the priest who responded gently open your heart to god the countess rejoined i ve ceased to bother about god when you ve forced me to admit that i hate him will you be any better off the priest continued you no longer hate him hate is indifference and contempt now at last you re face to face with him shake your fist at him spit in his face scourge him the countess did what the priest counseled by confessing her hate she was enabled to say all s well 119 protestant edit saul attacks david who had been playing music to help saul feel better 1860 woodcut by julius schnorr von karolsfeld a lutheran everyone experiences anger andrew d lester observes and furthermore anger can serve as a spiritual friend a spiritual guide and a spiritual ally denying and suppressing anger is contrary to st paul s admonition in his epistle to the ephesians 4 26 120 when anger toward god is denied and suppressed it interferes with an individual s relation with god expressing one s anger toward god can deepen the relationship 121 c fitzsimons allison holds that we worship god by expressing our honest anger at him 122 biblical scholar leonard pine concludes from his studies in the book of habakkuk that far from being a sin proper remonstration with god is the activity of a healthy faith relationship with him 123 other biblical examples of anger toward god include the following 124 moses was angry with god for mistreating his people lord why have you mistreated lit done evil to this people book of exodus 5 22 naomi was angry with god after the death of her husband and two sons the almighty has dealt bitterly with me the almighty has brought calamity upon me book of ruth 1 20 21 abr elijah was angry with god after the son of the widow died o lord my god have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom i am staying by killing her son 1 kings 17 20 job was angry with god you have turned cruel to me with the might of your hand you persecute me book of job 30 21 jeremiah was angry with god for deceiving his people ah lord god how utterly you have deceived this people and jerusalem book of jeremiah 4 10 hinduism edit in hinduism anger is equated with sorrow as a form of unrequited desire the objects of anger are perceived as a hindrance to the gratification of the desires of the angry person 125 alternatively if one thinks one is superior the result is grief anger is considered to be packed with more evil power than desire 126 in the bhagavad gita krishna regards greed anger and lust as signs of ignorance that lead to perpetual bondage as for the agitations of the bickering mind they are divided into two divisions the first is called avirodha prīti or unrestricted attachment and the other is called virodha yukta krodha anger arising from frustration adherence to the philosophy of the māyāvādīs belief in the fruitive results of the karma vādīs and belief in plans based on materialistic desires are called avirodha prīti 127 jñānīs karmīs and materialistic planmakers generally attract the attention of conditioned souls but when the materialists cannot fulfill their plans and when their devices are frustrated they become angry frustration of material desires produces anger 128 buddhism edit anger is defined in buddhism as being unable to bear the object or the intention to cause harm to the object anger is seen as aversion with a stronger exaggeration and is listed as one of the five hindrances buddhist monks such as dalai lama the spiritual leader of tibetans in exile sometimes get angry 129 most often a spiritual person is aware of the emotion and the way it can be handled thus in response to the question is any anger acceptable in buddhism the dalai lama answered 129 buddhism in general teaches that anger is a destructive emotion and although anger might have some positive effects in terms of survival or moral outrage i do not accept that anger of any kind as sic a virtuous emotion nor aggression as constructive behavior the gautama buddha sic has taught that there are three basic kleshas at the root of samsara bondage illusion and the vicious cycle of rebirth these are greed hatred and delusion also translatable as attachment anger and ignorance they bring us confusion and misery rather than peace happiness and fulfillment it is in our own self interest to purify and transform them buddhist scholar and author geshe kelsang gyatso has also explained buddha s teaching on the spiritual imperative to identify anger and overcome it by transforming difficulties 130 when things go wrong in our life and we encounter difficult situations we tend to regard the situation itself as our problem but in reality whatever problems we experience come from the side of the mind if we responded to difficult situations with a positive or peaceful mind they would not be problems for us eventually we might even regard them as challenges or opportunities for growth and development problems arise only if we respond to difficulties with a negative state of mind therefore if we want to be free from problems we must transform our mind the buddha himself on anger 131 an angry person is ugly sleeps poorly gaining a profit he turns it into a loss having done damage with word deed a person overwhelmed with anger destroys his wealth maddened with anger he destroys his status relatives friends colleagues avoid him anger brings loss anger inflames the mind he doesn t realize that his danger is born from within an angry person doesn t know his own benefit an angry person doesn t see the dharma a man conquered by anger is in a mass of darkness he takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good but later when his anger is gone he suffers as if burned with fire he is spoiled blotted out like fire enveloped in smoke when anger spreads when a man becomes angry he has no shame no fear of evil is not respectful in speech for a person overcome with anger nothing gives light islam edit a verse in the third surah of the quran instructs people to restrain their anger 132 anger arabic غضب ghadab in islam is considered to be instigated by satan shaitan 133 factors stated to lead to anger include selfishness arrogance and excessive ambition 134 islamic teachings also state that anger hinders the faith iman of a person 135 the quran attributes anger to prophets and believers as well as muhammad s enemies it mentions the anger of moses musa against his people for worshiping a golden calf and at the moment when moses strikes an egyptian for fighting against an israelite 136 the anger of jonah yunus is also mentioned in the quran which led to his departure from the people of nineveh and his eventual realization of his error and his repentance 137 the removal of anger from the hearts of believers by god arabic allah الله allāh after the fighting against muhammad s enemies is over 138 139 in general suppression of anger arabic کاظم kazm is deemed a praiseworthy quality in the hadis 139 140 141 ibn abdil barr the andalusian maliki jurist explains that controlling anger is the door way for restraining other blameworthy traits ego and envy since these two are less powerful than anger the hadis state various ways to diminish prevent and control anger one of these methods is to perform a ritual ablution a different narration states that the angry person should lie down and other narrations instruct the angry person to invoke god and seek refuge from the devil by reciting i take refuge with allah god from the accursed devil it has also been stated by the imam ali the commander of the faithful and the son in law of prophet muhammad that a moment of patience in a moment of anger saves a thousand moments of regret as well as anger begins with madness and ends in regret 134 divine retribution edit the great day of his wrath by john martin 1789 1854 in many religions anger is frequently attributed to god or gods primitive people held that gods were subject to anger and revenge in anthropomorphic fashion 142 the hebrew bible says that opposition to god s will results in god s anger 142 reform rabbi kaufmann kohler explains 110 god is not an intellectual abstraction nor is he conceived as a being indifferent to the doings of man and his pure and lofty nature resents most energetically anything wrong and impure in the moral world o lord my god mine holy one thou art of eyes too pure to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity christians believe in god s anger at the sight of evil this anger is not inconsistent with god s love as demonstrated in the gospel where the righteous

flight via jetpack weapon proficiency doll man is a superhero first appearing in american comic books from the golden age of comics originally published by quality comics and currently part of the dc comics universe of characters 1 doll man was created by cartoonist will eisner and first appeared in a four page story entitled meet the doll man in feature comics 27 he was quality s first super powered character 2 the issue s december 1939 cover date indicates that doll man is the first comic book superhero with a shrinking power he notably predates the more famous ray palmer dc s the atom and hank pym marvel comics ant man by two decades contents 1 quality comics publication history 2 doll man in dc comics 2 1 darrel dane 2 2 lester colt 3 powers and abilities 4 other versions 5 in other media 5 1 television 5 2 web 5 3 miscellaneous 6 references 7 external links quality comics publication history edit the secret identity of doll man the world s mightiest mite is research chemist darrel dane who invents a formula that enables him to shrink to the height of six inches while retaining the full strength of his normal size 3 he was the first example of a shrinking superhero and also one of the few that was unable to change to a height in between his minimum and maximum sizes though artists would fail to keep his scale visually consistent his first adventure in feature comics 27 involves the rescue of his fiancée martha roberts from a blackmailer 4 he subsequently decides to fight crime and adopts a red and blue costume sewn by martha 5 years later somehow martha s wish to be able to join him in his small size comes true and now possessing the same shrinking powers she becomes his partner known as doll girl in doll man 37 6 he also has the aid of elmo the wonder dog a great dane who serves as his occasional steed and rescuer and the dollplane which was deceptively presented as a model airplane in his study when not in use 7 in his adventures published during world war ii doll man was also frequently depicted riding a bald eagle the covers of doll man s comics frequently portrayed him tied in ropes or other bindings in situations ranging from being tied crucifixion style to a running sink faucet to being hogtied to the trigger and barrel of a handgun the persistence of this male bondage motif in doll man comics among others can be contrasted with other comic books which historically portrayed women in positions of vulnerability and submission doll man was the lead feature of the anthology series feature comics through 139 october 1949 with eisner writing the early stories under the pen name william erwin maxwell and art contributed first by lou fine and later by reed crandall 8 doll man s own self titled series ran from 1941 until 1953 for forty seven issues after the cancellation of doll man original stories involving the character were not published again for two decades 9 doll man in dc comics edit darrel dane edit after quality comics went out of business in 1956 dc acquired their superhero characters doll man and several other former quality properties were re launched in justice league of america 107 october 1973 as the freedom fighters 10 as was done with many other characters dc had acquired from other publishers or that were holdovers from golden age titles the freedom fighters were located on a parallel world one called earth x where nazi germany had won world war ii the team were featured in their own series for fifteen issues 1976 1978 in which the team temporarily leaves earth x for earth 1 where most dc titles were set doll man was an occasional guest star in all star squadron a superhero team title that was set on earth 2 the locale for dc s wwii era superheroes at a time prior to when he and the other freedom fighters are supposed to have left for earth x doll man then appeared with the rest of dc s entire cast of superheroes in crisis on infinite earths a story that was intended to eliminate the similarly confusing histories that dc had attached to its characters by retroactively merging the various parallel worlds into one this erased doll man s earth x days and merged the character s all star squadron and freedom fighter histories so that he is primarily a member of the squadron of which the freedom fighters are merely a splinter group 1 until the relaunch of the freedom fighters characters in 2006 doll man was little used by dc except for the retelling of his origin from feature comics 27 in secret origins 8 november 1986 according to uncle sam and the freedom fighters 5 january 2007 darrel dane is currently alive and confined to an unnamed mental institution in uncle sam and the freedom fighters v2 3 november 2007 dane whose given name is given as darryl or darrel appears as the leader of a subersive group of doll sized soldiers he reveals that the years spent at compressed size have damaged his mind leaving him mentally unstable lester colt edit a new doll man alias lester colt was introduced in crisis aftermath the battle for blüdhaven a mini series published by dc in 2006 1 lester colt is a famous u s special operator holding a b a in international politics and advanced degrees in the sciences he is an operational management and strategic adviser to s h a d e colt seems to be highly trained in the martial arts as well as being a very capable battlefield leader lester has a series of action figures named in his honor however he follows an ends justifies the means policy in his mission and in uncle sam and the freedom fighters 1 is shown cold bloodly killing a drug dealer in front of the man s young son at the boy s birthday party he had infiltrated the drug dealer s home disguised as one of his own action figures this action earns his a severe rebuke from the revived uncle sam in later issues when he detects from s h a d e and joins the new freedom fighters colt is a highly decorated old soldier and his personal decorations include the legion of merit six silver stars for gallantry fourteen bronze stars for valor and seventeen purple hearts colt is romantically involved with scientist and former s h a d e employee emma glenn eager to contribute to his country in something other than war lester agreed to an experiment created by emma s father which reduced him to his present height a s h a d e squad masquerading as a terrorist group killed emma s father and destroyed the lab now stuck at a permanent height of six inches tall colt attempted to distance himself from glenn hoping to spare her the pain of a miniaturized boyfriend despite this there are still strong feelings between the two and they are learning to cope with their new situation this is aided by trips to the heartland the current freedom fighters extradimensional home base where colt is mystically restored to full height for brief periods in the new freedom fighters series 2007 08 lester undergoes a procedure with several other shrunken people including darrel dane to be returned to normal size the experiment goes horribly wrong and the group are fused together into a human sized monstrosity lester is eventually freed and returned to his normal size powers and abilities edit by willing himself doll man can shrink to the height of six inches and a proportionate weight or return to his normal size 11 at his six inch height doll man retained the strength and athletics of a full grown man in recent years he have developed psionic powers enabling him to levitate objects or destroy them with a mental blast he has apparently aged a little but not at all for decades perhaps due to the mystic presence of uncle sam dane wears a special costume that changes size as he does as doll man he possesses a brilliant mind as well as unarmed combat skills the second doll man has similar powers and access to high tech equipment other versions edit a version of doll man and doll girl about whom little has been revealed

originally consisting of 52 identical realities among the parallel realities shown is one designated earth 10 as a result of mister mind eating aspects of this reality it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre crisis earth x including the quality characters the names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear but a character visually similar to the darrel dane doll man appears 12 based on comments by grant morrison this alternate universe is not the pre crisis earth x in other media edit television edit a super villain called dollman made a one

infinite earths was published bat mite was mostly removed from the batman comics canon 6 bat mite made an appearance in batman legends of the dark knight 38 although he may have been the hallucination

although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves in the post crisis issue superman batman 25 it was revealed that the joker had gained fifth dimensional powers by maintaining the essence of mr mxyzptlk from the earlier emperor joker storyline at the end bizarro was able to extract this latent magical essence from the joker which manifested in a form recognizable as bat mite as such a bat mite has been fully reestablished into the current continuity as an outgrowth of mr mxyzptlk incubated within the joker 8 the first post infinite crisis

manufactured by bruce himself to keep batman able to fight in case he was mindwiped or driven to insanity batman 680 reveals that might is indeed a product of batman s imagination representing the last vestiges of batman s rational mind within the zur en arrh batman although when asked by batman whether he is an extra dimensional being or a figment of his imagination bat mite responds that the fifth dimension is imagination 11 in superman batman 52 bat mite appears having had a bet with mr mxyzptlk similar to that of world s funnest this bat mite appears to admire batman and batman

exert control through pain compliance or fear of pain they can also be used without inflicting pain for audiovisual cues such as in equestrianism they are generally either a firm stick designed for direct contact or a flexible line requiring a specialized swing the former is easier and more precise the latter offers longer reach and greater force a hunting whip combines a firm stick the stock or handle with a flexible line the lash or thong whips such as the cat o nine tails and knout are specifically developed for flagellation as a means of inflicting corporal punishment or torture on human

directional guidance or to encourage movement some whips are designed to control animals by imparting discomfort by tapping or pain by a full force strike that produces pain compliance some whips provide guidance by the use of sound such as cracking of a bullwhip other uses of whips are to provide a visual directional cue by extending the reach and visibility of the human arm in modern times the pain stimulus is still used in some animal training and is permitted in many fields including most equestrianism disciplines some of which mandate carrying a whip the whip can be a vital tool to back up riding aids when applied correctly particularly when initial commands are ignored however many competition governing bodies limit the use of whips and severe penalties may be in place for over use of the whip including disqualification and fines 1 improper overuse of whips may be considered animal cruelty in some jurisdictions 2 whip made in silesia poland made to enhance its cracking sound used in folk easter celebrations of siuda baba whip use by sound never or rarely strikes the animal instead a long flexible whip is cracked to produce a very sharp loud sound this usage also functions as a form of operant conditioning most animals will flinch away from the sound instinctively making it effective for driving sled dogs livestock and teams of harnessed animals like oxen and mules the sound is loud enough to affect multiple animals at once making whip cracking more efficient under some circumstances this technique can be used as part of an escalation response with sound being used first prior to a pain stimulus being applied again as part of operant conditioning whips used without painful stimulus as an extension of the human hand or arm are a visual command or to tap an animal or to exert pressure such use may be related to operant conditioning where the subject is conditioned to associate the whip with irritation discomfort or pain but in other cases a whip can be used as a simple tool to provide a cue connected to positive reinforcement for compliant behavior in the light of modern attitudes towards the potential for cruelty in whips other names have gained currency among practitioners such as whips called a wand or a stick calling the lash a string or a popper cracking edit main article whipcracking the loud sound of a whip crack is produced by a ripple in the material of whip travelling towards the tip rapidly escalating in speed until it breaches the speed of sound more than 30 times the speed of the initial movement in the handle the crack is thus a small sonic boom 3 whips were the first man made objects to break the sound barrier citation needed most stick type whips cannot make a crack by themselves unless they either have a very long lash such as a longe whip or are very flexible with a moderately long lash like certain styles of buggy whip but any design can be banged against another object such as leather boot to make a loud noise short stiff crops often have a wide leather popper at the end which makes a particularly loud noise when slapped against an animal boot or other object types edit stockwhip edit main article stockwhip an australian stockwhip an australian bullwhip stockwhips or stock whips including bullwhips and the australian stockwhip are a type of single tailed leather whip with a very long lash but a short handle stockwhips are primarily used to make a loud cracking sound via special techniques that break the sound barrier to move livestock cattle sheep horses etc away from the sound it is generally not used to actually strike an animal as it would inflict excessive pain and is difficult to apply with precision australian edit the australian stockwhip is often said to have originated in the english hunting whip but it has since become a distinct type of whip today it is used primarily by stockmen unlike the short embedded handle of a bullwhip the stockwhip handle is not fitted inside the lash and is usually longer a stockwhip s handle is connected to the thong by a joint typically made of a few strands of thick leather which is called a keeper this allows the whip to hang across a stockman s arm when not being used the handles are normally longer than those of a bullwhip being between 38 and 53 cm 15 and 21 in the thong can be from 1 to 3 metres 3 to 10 ft long stockwhips are also almost exclusively made from tanned kangaroo hide the australian stockwhip was shown internationally when lone rider steve jefferys reared his australian stock horse and cracked the stockwhip to commence the 2000 sydney olympic games opening ceremony bullwhip edit main article bullwhip a bullwhip consists of a handle between 20 and 30 cm 8 and 12 in in length and a lash composed of a braided thong between 1 to 6 metres 3 to 20 ft long some whips have an exposed wooden grip others have an intricately braided leather covered handle unlike the australian stock whip the thong connects in line with the handle rather than with a joint or even engulfs the handle entirely at the end of the lash is the fall and cracker or popper the fall is a single piece of leather between 25 to 76 cm 10 to 30 in in length during trick shots or target work the fall is usually the portion of the whip used to cut strike or wrap around the target the cracker is the portion of the whip that makes the loud sonic boom sound but a whip without a cracker will still make a sonic boom simply not as loud other edit a whip made of balatá made prior to 1939 whip possibly native american plains late 19th century

ft long or more and often made of greenhide a long handle was cut from spotted gum or another native tree and was frequently taller than the bullock driver s shoulder the bullocky walked beside the team and kept the bullocks moving with taps from the long handle as well as using the thong as needed 4 the rose whip is another variation of the stockwhip that was pioneered in canada in the early 19th century though it largely fell out of use by the 1880s the rose whips were effective in animal yards and other small areas it was pioneered by an american farmer jack liao citation needed the raman whip is a similar variation of the stockwhip which closely relates to the rose whip this variation was pioneered in the small ontario city of hamilton in the early 20th century though it largely fell out of use by the 1920s raman whips were effective on horse farms horse derbies and in other rural areas it was pioneered by the south african inventor delaware kumar cow whip edit the florida cow whip used by floridian cowboys is a two piece unit like the stockwhip and is connected to the handle by threading two strands of the thong through a hollow part of a wooden handle before being tied off the cowwhip is heavier than the australian stockwhip early cowwhips were made mostly of cowhide or buckskin modern cow whips are made of flat nylon parachute cord which unlike those made from leather are still effective when wet most cowwhips have handles that average 41 cm 16 in and thongs that average 30 cm 12 in a good cowwhip can produce a loud crack by a simple push of the handle this can make it more convenient to use than a bullwhip in a thick vegetated environment with less swinging room the tampa bay whip enthusiasts give demonstrations of the florida cracker cowboy in costume

fall in a signal whip the cracker attaches directly to the body of the whip snakewhip edit snake whips or snakewhips are a type of single tailed whip the name snake whip is derived from the fact that

device to the hounds a quirt is a short flexible piece of thickly braided leather with two wide pieces of leather at the end which makes a loud crack when it strikes an animal or object they inflict more noise than pain quirts are occasionally carried on horses used in western riding disciplines but because the action of a quirt is slow they are not used to correct or guide the horse but are more

the late 1900s the 15 cm handle is made from a steel chain wrapped with leather the lash is made of steel rods decreasing in size linked by progressively smaller steel rings lash varies between 150 cm and 180 cm and is attached to a fall and a cracker total weight is 1 2 kg it is used for physical exercise and in performances 8 similar natural appendages edit some organisms exhibit whip like appendages in their physiology many unicellular organisms and spermatozoa have one or two whip like flagella which are used for propulsion flagellum is latin for whip the tails of some large lizards e g iguanas and monitor lizards are used and optimized for whipping and larger lizards can seriously injure a human with a well placed strike 9 the biological names of some lizards reference this with the terms mastigo or mastix which derive from the greek term for whip the whip snakes are so called from their physical resemblance and were associated with myths that they could whip with their body in self defense since proven false thelyphonida arachnids are also known as whip scorpions due to the shape of their tails it has been proposed that some sauropod dinosaurs could crack the ends of their tails like coach whips as a sound signal as well as a form of defense against any attackers in popular culture edit the whip is widely if only situationally portrayed across many avenues of popular culture whips have appeared in many cartoons television shows video games including a central role in the castlevania franchise and numerous feature films ranging from the original zorro 1919 to raiders of the lost ark 1981 and catwoman 2004 the depicted usage of whips is often dramatic and wildly exaggerated showing users reliably tripping or disarming adversaries under extraordinary circumstances breaking substantial objects with normal blows and use as a grappling aid among others this last usage is particularly common and specifically involves wrapping the whip around a fixed overhead object and using the body to swing across an open space while this is theoretically possible the wrap must exhibit intense strength enough to hold the user s body weight for the entire leap but be made of material loose enough to smoothly disengage once the swing is completed thus actual use in this fashion is highly impractical it would require not only a precisely balanced whip relative to the user but also to the overhead fixture which would not only compromise the whip s efficacy for any other use or context but require exceptional contrivance of circumstance even granted all of this the strain of such a swing will damage or break most leather whips in live action fiction the visual effect is achieved by braiding the whip over a steel or kevlar support cable and anchoring the tip permanently to a support such as a crane or scaffolding in many instances the whip handle is also attached to a concealed body harness on the actor for safety allowing more dynamic motions to make the swing appear more daring and graceful the popular investigative entertainment program mythbusters tested the various capabilities of whips shown in the film raiders of the lost ark during the busters of the lost myths episode with exact trained usage the show demonstrated that it is possible to disarm a pistol wielding opponent with a long whip strike the episode also demonstrates that a wood log with sufficient friction could be used as an overhang to grapple with a whip swing across a chasm and neatly disengage using a high speed camera they were also able to verify that the tip of a whip can break the speed of sound in the sherlock holmes series of stories by sir arthur conan doyle holmes occasionally carries a loaded hunting crop as his favorite weapon for example see the adventure of the six napoleons such crops were sold at one time loading refers to the practice of filling the shaft and head with heavy metal e g steel lead to provide some heft 10

at night kane finger and other creators accompanied batman with supporting characters including his sidekicks robin and batgirl allies alfred pennyworth james gordon and catwoman and foes such as the penguin the riddler two face and his archenemy the joker kane conceived batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of dc s superman although kane frequently claimed sole creation credit finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat like the character received his own spin off publication batman in 1940 batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice unlike most superheroes batman does not possess any superpowers instead relying on his intellect fighting skills and wealth the 1960s batman television series used a camp aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s culminating with the 1986 miniseries the dark knight returns by frank miller dc has featured batman in many comic books including comics published under its imprints such as vertigo and black label the longest running batman comic detective comics is the longest running comic book in the united states batman is frequently depicted alongside other dc superheroes such as superman and wonder woman as a member of organizations such as the justice league and the outsiders in addition to bruce wayne other characters have taken on the batman persona on different occasions such as jean paul valley azrael in the 1993 1994 knightfall story arc dick grayson the first robin from 2009 to

of batman in action comics 12 announcing the character s debut in the forthcoming detective comics 27 5 in early 1939 the success of superman in action comics prompted editors at national comics publications the future dc comics to request more superheroes for its titles in response bob kane created the bat man 6 collaborator bill finger recalled that kane had an idea for a character called batman and he d like me to see the drawings i went over to kane s and he had drawn a character who looked very much like superman with kind of reddish tights i believe with boots no gloves no gauntlets with a small domino mask swinging on a rope he had two stiff wings that were sticking out looking like bat wings and under it was a big sign batman 7 the bat wing like cape was suggested by bob kane inspired as a child by leonardo da vinci s sketch of an ornithopter flying device 8 finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask a cape instead of wings and gloves he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume 9 10 11 12 finger said he devised the name bruce wayne for the character s secret identity bruce wayne s first name came from robert the bruce the scottish patriot wayne being a playboy was a man of gentry i searched for a name that would suggest colonialism i tried adams hancock then i thought of mad anthony wayne 13 he later said his suggestions were influenced by lee falk s popular the phantom a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which kane was also familiar 14 kane and finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the bat man s look personality methods and weaponry details find predecessors in pulp fiction comic strips newspaper headlines and autobiographical details referring to kane himself 15 as an aristocratic hero with a double identity batman had predecessors in the scarlet pimpernel created by baroness emmuska orczy 1903 and zorro created by johnston mcculley 1919 like them batman performed his heroic deeds in secret averted suspicion by playing aloof in public and marked his work with a signature symbol kane noted the influence of the films the mark of zorro 1920 and the bat whispers 1930 in the creation of the character s iconography finger drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like doc savage the shadow dick tracy and sherlock holmes made the character a master sleuth 16 17 in his 1989 autobiography kane detailed finger s contributions to batman s creation one day i called bill and said i have a new character called the bat man and i ve made some crude elementary sketches i d like you to look at he came over and i showed him the drawings at the time i only had a small domino mask like the one robin later wore on batman s face bill said why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious at this point the bat man wore a red union suit the wings trunks and mask were black i thought that red and black would be a good combination bill said that the costume was too bright color it dark grey to make it look more ominous the cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms as bill and i talked we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when bat man was in action and changed them into a cape scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope also he didn t have any gloves on and we added them so that he wouldn t leave fingerprints 14 golden age subsequent creation credit kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for among other compensation a mandatory byline on all batman comics this byline did not originally say batman created by bob kane his name was simply written on the title page of each story the name disappeared from the comic book in the mid 1960s replaced by credits for each story s actual writer and artists in the late 1970s when jerry siegel and joe shuster began receiving a created by credit on the superman titles along with william moulton marston being given the byline for creating wonder woman batman stories began saying created by bob kane in addition to the other credits finger did not receive the same recognition while he had received credit for other dc work since the 1940s he began in the 1960s to receive limited acknowledgment for his batman writing in the letters page of batman 169 february 1965 for example editor julius schwartz names him as the creator of the riddler one of batman s recurring villains however finger s contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline kane wrote bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career he felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by 13 at the time of finger s death in 1974 dc had not officially credited finger as batman co creator jerry robinson who also worked with finger and kane on the strip at this time has criticized kane for failing to share the credit he recalled finger resenting his position stating in a 2005 interview with the comics journal bob made him more insecure because while he slaved working on batman he wasn t sharing in any of the glory or the money that bob began to make which is why he was going to leave kane s employ kane should have credited bill as co creator because i know i was there that was one thing i would never forgive bob for was not to take care of bill or recognize his vital role in the creation of batman as with siegel and shuster it should have been the same the same co creator credit in the strip writer and artist 18 although kane initially rebutted finger s claims at having created the character writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that it seemed to me that bill finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the batman t sic as well as robin and all the other leading villains and characters this statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue kane himself also commented on finger s lack of credit the trouble with being a ghost writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without credit however if one wants the credit then one has to cease being a ghost or follower and become a leader or innovator 19 in 1989 kane revisited finger s situation recalling in an interview in those days it was like one artist and he had his name over it the comic strip the policy of dc in the comic books was if you can t write it obtain other writers but their names would never appear on the comic book in the finished version so bill never asked me for it the byline and i never volunteered i guess my ego at that time and i felt badly really when he finger died 20 in september 2015 dc entertainment revealed that finger would be receiving credit for his role in batman s creation on the 2016 superhero film batman v superman dawn of justice and the second season of gotham after a deal was worked out between the finger family and dc 2 finger received credit as a creator of batman for the first time in a comic in october 2015 with batman and robin eternal 3 and batman arkham knight genesis 3 the updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as batman created by bob kane with bill finger 3 early years batman made his debut in detective comics 27 cover dated may 1939 cover art by bob kane the first batman story the case of the chemical syndicate was published in detective comics 27 cover dated may 1939 finger said batman was originally written in the style of the pulps 21 and this influence was evident with batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals batman proved a hit character and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in detective comics by that time detective comics was the top selling and most influential publisher in the industry batman and the company s other major hero superman were the cornerstones of the company s success 22 the two characters were featured side by side as the stars of world s finest comics which was originally titled world s best comics when it debuted in fall 1940 creators including jerry robinson and dick sprang also worked on the strips during this period over the course of the first few batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of batman evolved kane noted that within six issues he drew the character s jawline more pronounced and lengthened the ears on the costume about a year later he was almost the full figure my mature batman kane said 23 batman s characteristic utility belt was introduced in detective comics 29 july 1939 followed by the boomerang like batarang and the first bat themed vehicle the batplane in 31 september 1939 the character s origin was revealed in 33 november 1939 unfolding in a two page story that establishes the brooding persona of batman a character driven by the death of his parents written by finger it depicts a young bruce wayne witnessing his parents murder at the hands of a mugger days later at their grave the child vows that by the spirits of my parents i will avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals 24 25 26 the early pulp inflected portrayal of batman started to soften in detective comics 38 april 1940 with the introduction of robin batman s junior counterpart 27 robin was introduced based on finger s suggestion because batman needed a watson with whom batman could talk 28 sales nearly doubled despite kane s preference for a solo batman and it sparked a proliferation of kid sidekicks 29 the first issue of the solo spin off series batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies the joker and catwoman but for a pre robin inventory story originally meant for detective comics 38 in which batman shoots some monstrous giants to death 30 31 that story prompted editor whitney ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun 32 by 1942 the writers and artists behind the batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the batman mythos 33 in the years following world war ii dc comics adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy the impact of this editorial approach was evident in batman comics of the postwar period removed from the bleak and menacing world of the strips of the early 1940s batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a bright and colorful environment 34 silver and bronze ages 1950s and early 1960s batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s in the story the mightiest team in the world in superman 76 june 1952 batman teams up with superman for the first time and the pair discover each other s secret identity 35 following the success of this story world s finest comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together instead of the separate batman and superman features that had been running before 36 the team up of the characters was a financial success in an era when those were few and far between 37 this series of stories ran until the book s cancellation in 1986 batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist fredric wertham s book seduction of the innocent in 1954 wertham s thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth wertham criticized batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that batman and robin were portrayed as lovers 38 wertham s criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s eventually leading to the establishment of the comics code authority a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry the tendency towards a sunnier batman in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the comics code 39 scholars have suggested that the characters of batwoman in 1956 and the pre barbara gordon bat girl in 1961 were introduced in part to refute the allegation that batman and robin were gay and the stories took on a campier lighter feel 40 in the late 1950s batman stories gradually became more science fiction oriented an attempt at mimicking the success of other dc characters that had dabbled in the genre 41 new characters such as batwoman the original bat girl ace the bat hound and bat mite were introduced batman s adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens in 1960 batman debuted as a member of the justice league of america in the brave and the bold 28 february 1960 and went on to appear in several justice league comic book series starting later that same year new look batman and camp by 1964 sales of batman titles had fallen drastically bob kane noted that as a result dc was planning to kill batman off altogether 42 in response to this editor julius schwartz was assigned to the batman titles he presided over drastic changes beginning with 1964 s detective comics 327 may 1964 which was cover billed as the new look schwartz introduced changes designed to make batman more contemporary and to return him to more detective oriented stories he brought in artist carmine infantino to help overhaul the character the batmobile was redesigned and batman s costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat insignia the space aliens time travel and characters of the 1950s such as batwoman ace the bat hound and bat mite were retired bruce wayne s butler alfred was killed off though his death was quickly reversed while a new female relative for the wayne family aunt harriet cooper came to live with bruce wayne and dick grayson 43 the debut of the batman television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character the success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry and batman reached a circulation of close to 900 000 copies 44 elements such as the character of batgirl and the show s campy nature were introduced into the comics the series also initiated the return of alfred although both the comics and tv show were successful for a time the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968 in the aftermath the batman comics themselves lost popularity once again as julius schwartz noted when the television show was a success i was asked to be campy and of course when the show faded so did the comic books 45 starting in 1969 writer dennis o neil and artist neal adams made a deliberate effort to distance batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s tv series and to return the character to his roots as a grim avenger of the night 46 o neil said his idea was simply to take it back to where it started i went to the dc library and read some of the early stories i tried to get a sense of what kane and finger were after 47 o neil and adams first collaborated on the story the secret of the waiting graves in detective comics 395 january 1970 few stories were true collaborations between o neil adams schwartz and inker dick giordano and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s nevertheless the influence of their work was tremendous 48 giordano said we went back to a grimmer darker batman and i think that s why these stories did so well 49 while the work of o neil and adams was popular with fans the acclaim did little to improve declining sales the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer steve englehart and penciler marshall rogers in detective comics 471 476 august 1977 april 1978 which went on to influence the 1989 movie batman and be adapted for batman the animated series which debuted

resurgence in the character s popularity 53 that year dennis o neil took over as editor of the batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of batman following dc s status quo altering 12 issue miniseries crisis on infinite earths o neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before 54 one outcome of this new approach was the year one storyline in batman 404 407 february may 1987 in which frank miller and artist david mazzucchelli redefined the character s origins writer

concept art of bruce wayne by mikel janín batman s secret identity is bruce wayne a wealthy american industrialist as a child bruce witnessed the murder of his parents dr thomas wayne and martha wayne which ultimately led him to craft the batman persona and seek justice against criminals he resides on the outskirts of gotham city in his personal residence wayne manor wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family s fortune and the profits of wayne enterprises his inherited conglomerate 73 74 he supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit wayne foundation which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite 75 in public he frequently appears in the company of high status women which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess 76 although bruce wayne leads an active romantic life his vigilante activities as batman account for most of his time 77 various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant playboy image of bruce wayne as a facade 78 this is in contrast to the post crisis superman whose clark kent persona is the true identity while the superman persona is the facade 79 80 in batman unmasked a television documentary about the psychology of the character behavioral scientist benjamin karney notes that batman s personality is driven by bruce wayne s inherent humanity that batman for all its benefits and for all of the time bruce wayne devotes to it is ultimately a tool for bruce wayne s efforts to make the world better bruce wayne s principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill bruce wayne believes that our actions define us we fail for a reason and anything is possible 81 writers of batman and superman stories

day night contrast their heroic roles display morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities bruce wayne and clark kent belong to different social classes bruce has a butler clark has a boss t james musler s book unleashing the superhero in us all explores the extent to which bruce wayne s vast personal wealth is important in his life story and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as batman 83 will brooker notes in his book batman unmasked that the confirmation of the batman s identity lies with the young audience he doesn t have to be bruce wayne he just needs the suit and gadgets the abilities and most importantly the morality the humanity there s just a sense about him they trust him and they re never wrong 84 personality batman s primary character traits can be summarized as wealth physical prowess deductive abilities and obsession 85 the details and tone of batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams dennis o neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes julie schwartz did a batman in batman and detective and murray boltinoff did a batman in the brave and the bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other julie and murray did not want to coordinate their efforts nor were they asked to do so continuity was not important in those days 86 the driving force behind bruce wayne s character is his parents murder and their absence bob kane and bill finger discussed batman s background and decided that there s nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes 87 despite his trauma he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist 88 89 and to train his body into physical perfection 88 89 to fight crime in gotham city as batman an inspired idea from wayne s insight into the criminal mind 88 89 he also speaks over 40 different languages 90 another of batman s characterizations is that of a vigilante in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents he must sometimes break the law himself although manifested differently by being re told by different artists it is nevertheless that the

personality willingness to use violence and torture and increasingly alienated behavior batman shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of robin was changed in 1940 after dc editor whitney ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and dc established their own ethical code subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code 32 96 which has stayed with the character of batman ever since miller s batman was closer to the original pre robin version who was willing to kill criminals if necessary 97 others on several occasions former robin dick grayson

being nightwing following the flashpoint crossover event in an interview with ign morrison detailed that having dick grayson as batman and damian wayne as robin represented a reverse of the normal dynamic between batman and robin with a more light hearted and spontaneous batman and a scowling badass robin morrison explained their intentions for the new characterization of batman dick grayson is kind of this consummate superhero the guy has been batman s partner since he was a kid he s led the teen titans and he s trained with everybody in the dc universe so he s a very different kind of

hook attached to a cable this allows him to attach to distant objects be propelled into the air and thus swing from the rooftops of gotham city an exception to the range of batman s equipment are hand guns which he refuses to use on principle since a gun was used in his parents murder in modern stories in terms of his vehicles batman compromises on that principle to install weapon systems on them

of the character s history have varied greatly scholars william uricchio and roberta e pearson noted in the early 1990s unlike some fictional characters the batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades 124 20th century origin main article origin of batman thomas and martha wayne are shot by joe chill in detective comics 33 november 1939 art by bob kane the central fixed event in the batman stories is the character s origin story 85 as a young boy bruce wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents the physician dr thomas wayne and his wife martha murdered with a gun by a mugger named joe chill batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents this event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in gotham city as batman pearson and uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of robin until recently the fixed and accruing and hence canonized events have been few in number 85 a situation altered by an increased effort by later batman editors such as dennis o neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories 125 golden age see also batman earth two in batman s first appearance in detective comics 27 he is already operating as a crime fighter 126 batman s origin is first presented in detective comics 33 november 1939 and is later expanded upon in batman 47 as these comics state bruce wayne is born to dr

when the publisher introduced barry allen as a new updated version of the flash batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as earth one the lighter tone batman had taken in the period between the golden and silver ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science fiction elements and batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until detective comics 327 may 1964 in which batman reverts to his detective roots with most science fiction elements jettisoned from the series after the introduction of dc comics multiverse in the 1960s dc established that stories from the golden age star the earth two batman a character from a parallel world this version of batman

psychologist fredric wertham asserted in seduction of the innocent in 1954 that batman stories are psychologically homosexual the batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies of the nature of which they may be unconscious 261 andy medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay batman deviance and camp that batman is interesting to gay audiences because he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality 262 professor of film and cultural studies will brooker argues the validity of a queer reading of batman and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within whether the character of bruce wayne himself were explicitly gay or not he also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character 263 in 2005 painter mark chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both batman and robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses 264 prompting dc to threaten legal action 265 creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions writer alan grant has stated the batman i wrote for 13 years isn t gay everybody s batman all the way back to bob kane none of them wrote him as a gay character only joel schumacher might have had an opposing view 266 frank miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he is borderline pathological concluding he d be much healthier if he were gay 267 grant morrison said that gayness is built into batman obviously as a fictional character he s intended to be heterosexual but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay 268 psychological interpretations this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it april 2019 batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time and there have been a number of interpretations into the character s psyche in batman and psychology a dark and stormy knight dr travis langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists carl jung and joseph campbell is present in the batman mythos such that the character represents the shadow archetype this archetype according to langley represents a person s own dark side it is not necessarily an evil one but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself langley argues that bruce wayne confronts his own darkness early in life he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil langley uses the jungian perspective to assert that batman appeals to our own need to face our shadow selves 269 270 langley also taught a class called batman a title he was adamant about i could have called it something like the psychology of nocturnal vigilantism but no i called it batman langley says 271 several psychologists have explored bruce wayne batman s mental health robin s rosenberg evaluated his actions and problems to determine if they reach the level of mental disorders she examined the possibility of several mental health issues including dissociative identity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder and several others she concluded that bruce wayne batman may have a disorder or a combination of disorders but due to his fictional nature a definitive diagnosis will remain unknown 272 273 274 however langley himself states in his book that batman is far too functional and well adjusted due to his training confrontation of his fear early on and other factors to be mentally ill more likely he asserts batman s mental attitude is far more in line with a dedicated olympic athlete see also batman rapist camazotz notes originally stylized as the bat man also

1853 oculogryphus jeng engel and yang 2007 photoctus mcdermott 1961 pollaclasis newman 1838 the lampyridae are a family of elateroid beetles with more than 2 000 described species many of which are light emitting they are soft bodied beetles commonly called fireflies lightning bugs or glowworms for their conspicuous production of light mainly during twilight to attract mates light production in the lampyridae is thought to have originated as an honest warning signal that the larvae were distasteful this was co opted in evolution as a mating signal in the adults in a further development female fireflies of the genus photuris mimic the flash pattern of photinus species to trap their males as prey fireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates many live in marshes or in wet wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food while all known fireflies glow as larvae only some adults produce light and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species fireflies have attracted human attention since classical antiquity their presence has been taken to signify a wide variety of conditions in different cultures and is especially appreciated aesthetically in japan where parks are set aside for this specific purpose contents 1 biology 1 1 light and chemical production 2 evolution 2 1 fossil history 2 2 taxonomy 2 3 phylogeny 3 interaction with humans 3 1 conservation 3 2 in culture 4 references 5 sources 6 further reading 7 external links biology edit a larviform female with light emitting organs on her abdomen unlike actual larvae she has compound eyes fireflies are beetles and in many aspects resemble other beetles at all stages of their life cycle undergoing complete metamorphosis 5 a few days after mating a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground the eggs hatch three to four weeks later 6 in certain firefly species with aquatic larvae such as aquatica leii the female oviposits on emergent portions of aquatic plants and the larvae descend into the water after hatching 7 the larvae feed until the end of the summer most fireflies hibernate as larvae some do this by burrowing underground while others find places on or under the bark of trees they emerge in the spring at least one species ellychnia corrusca overwinters as an adult 8 the larvae of most species are specialized predators and feed on other larvae terrestrial snails and slugs some are so specialized that they have grooved mandibles that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey the larval stage lasts from several weeks up to in certain species two or more years 9 the larvae pupate for one to two and a half weeks and emerge as adults 6 adult diet varies between firefly species some are predatory while others feed on plant pollen or nectar some adults like the european glow worm have no mouth emerging only to mate and lay eggs before dying in most species adults live for a few weeks in summer 6 10 fireflies vary widely in their general appearance with differences in color shape size and features such as antennae adults differ in size depending on the species with the largest up to 25 mm 1 in long many species have non flying larviform females these can often be distinguished from the larvae only because the adult females have compound eyes unlike the simple eyes of larvae though the females have much smaller and often highly regressed eyes than those of their males 11 the most commonly known fireflies are nocturnal although numerous species are diurnal and usually not luminescent however some species that remain in shadowy areas may produce light 5 most fireflies are distasteful to vertebrate predators as they contain the steroid pyrones lucibufagins similar to the cardiotonic bufadienolides found in some poisonous toads 12 all fireflies glow as larvae where bioluminescence is an honest aposematic warning signal to predators 13 14 15 light and chemical production edit further information bioluminescence photuris female by flash above by her own light below light production in fireflies is due to the chemical process of bioluminescence this occurs in specialized light emitting organs usually on a female firefly s lower abdomen the enzyme luciferase acts on the luciferin in the presence of magnesium ions atp and oxygen to produce light oxygen is supplied via an abdominal trachea or breathing tube gene coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms 16 firefly luciferase is used in forensics and the enzyme has medical uses in particular for detecting the presence of atp or magnesium 13 fireflies produce a cold light with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies the light may be yellow green or pale red with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers some species such as the dimly glowing blue ghost of the eastern us may seem to emit blueish white light from a distance and in low light conditions but their glow is bright green when observed up close 17 their perceived blue tint may be due to the purkinje effect 18 adults emit light primarily for mate selection early larval bioluminescence was adopted in the phylogeny of adult fireflies and was repeatedly gained and lost before becoming fixed and retained as a mechanism of sexual communication in many species 13 19 adult lampyrids have a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships steady glows flashing and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems 20 chemical signals or pheromones are the ancestral form of sexual communication this pre dates the evolution of flash signaling in the lineage and is retained today in diurnally active species 13 21 some species especially lightning bugs of the genera photinus photuris and pyractomena are distinguished by the unique courtship flash patterns emitted by flying males in search of females in general females of the genus photinus do not fly but do give a flash response to males of their own species signals whether photic or chemical allow fireflies to identify mates of their own species flash signaling characteristics include differences in duration timing color number and rate of repetitions height of flight and direction of flight e g climbing or diving and vary interspecifically and geographically 22 15 when flash signals are not sufficiently distinguished between species in a population sexual selection encourages divergence of signaling patterns 22 synchronization of flashing occurs in several species it is explained as phase synchronization and spontaneous order 23 tropical fireflies routinely synchronise their flashes among large groups particularly in southeast asia at night along river banks in the malaysian jungles fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely current hypotheses about the causes of this behavior involve diet social interaction and altitude in the philippines thousands of fireflies can be seen all year round in the town of donsol in the united states one of the most famous sightings of fireflies blinking in unison occurs annually near elkmont tennessee in the great smoky mountains during the first weeks of june 24 congaree national park in south carolina is another host to this phenomenon 25 female femme fatale photuris fireflies mimic the photic signaling patterns of the smaller photinus attracting males to what appears to be a suitable mate and eating them 13 this provides the females with a supply of the toxic defensive lucibufagin chemicals 26 many fireflies do not produce light usually these species are diurnal or day flying such as those in the genus ellychnia a few diurnal fireflies that inhabit primarily shadowy places such as beneath tall plants or trees are luminescent one such genus is lucidota non bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones to signal mates this is supported by the fact that some basal groups do not show bioluminescence and use chemical signaling instead phosphaenus hemipterus has photic organs yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes these traits strongly suggest pheromones are used for sexual selection while photic organs are used for warning signals in controlled experiments males coming from downwind arrived at females first indicating that males travel upwind along a pheromone plume males can find females without the use of visual cues so sexual communication in p hemipterus appears to be mediated entirely by pheromones 27 lamprohiza female by her own light a video of fireflies fireflies in the woods near nuremberg germany 30 second exposure evolution edit fossil history edit the oldest known fossil of the lampyridae family is protoluciola from the late cretaceous cenomanian 99 million years ago burmese amber of myanmar which belongs to the subfamily luciolinae the light producing organ is clearly present 28 the ancestral glow colour for the last common ancestor of all living fireflies has been inferred to be green based on genomic analysis 29 taxonomy edit the fireflies including the lightning bugs are a family lampyridae of some 2 000 species within the coleoptera the family forms a single clade a natural phylogenetic group 1 the term glowworm is used for both adults and larvae of firefly species such as lampyris noctiluca the common european glowworm in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly the flying males glow weakly and intermittently 30 31 32 in the americas glow worms are the closely related coleopteran family phengodidae while in new zealand and australia a glow worm is a luminescent larva of the fungus gnat arachnocampa within the true flies diptera 30 phylogeny edit the phylogeny of the lampyridae family based on both phylogenetic and morphological evidence by martin et al 2019 is 1 coleoptera cantharidae etc elateriformia elateridae rhagophthalmidae phengodidae lampyridae luciolinae pterotinae ototretinae lamprohizinae psilocladinae amydetinae photurinae lampyrinae bioluminescent interaction with humans edit conservation edit fireflies in georgia 8 second exposure firefly populations are thought to be declining worldwide while monitoring data for many regions are scarce a growing number of anecdotal reports coupled with several published studies from europe and asia suggest that fireflies are in trouble 33 34 35 36 recent iucn red list assessments for north american fireflies have identified species with heightened extinction risk in the us with 18 taxa categorized as threatened with extinction 37 38 fireflies face threats including habitat loss and degradation light pollution pesticide use and climate change 39 firefly tourism a quickly growing sector of the travel and tourism industry has also been identified as a potential threat to fireflies and their habitats when not managed appropriately 40 like many other organisms fireflies are directly affected by land use change e g loss of habitat area and connectivity which is identified as the main driver of biodiversity changes in terrestrial ecosystems 41 pesticides including insecticides and herbicides have also been indicated as a likely cause of firefly decline 42 43 these chemicals can not only directly harm fireflies but they also have the potential to reduce prey populations and degrade habitat light pollution is an especially concerning threat to fireflies since the majority of firefly species utilize bioluminescent courtship signals 44 they are also very sensitive to environmental levels of light and consequently to light pollution 44 45 a growing number of studies investigating the effects of artificial light at night on fireflies has shown that light pollution can disrupt fireflies courtship signals and even interfere with larval dispersal 46 47 48 49 researchers agree that protecting and enhancing firefly habitat is necessary to conserve their populations recommendations include reducing or limiting artificial light at night restoring habitats where threatened species occur and eliminating unnecessary pesticide use among many others 43 50 51 in culture

cathartidae a vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion there are 23 extant species of vulture including condors 2 old world vultures include 16 living species native to europe africa and asia new world vultures are restricted to north and south america and consist of seven identified species all belonging to the cathartidae family 2 3 a particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald unfeathered head this bare skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding and also plays an important role in thermoregulation 4 vultures have been observed to hunch their bodies and tuck in their heads in the cold and open their wings and stretch their necks in the heat they also urinate on themselves as a means of cooling their bodies 5 a group of vultures in flight is called a kettle

are not very closely related rather they share resemblance because of convergent evolution 7 early naturalists placed all vultures under one single biological group carl linnaeus had assigned both old world vultures and new world vultures in a vultur genus even including the harpy eagle soon anatomists split old and new world vultures with new world vultures being placed in a new suborder cathartae later renamed cathartidae as per the rules of nomenclature from greek carthartes meaning purifier 8 by french ornithologist frédéric de lafresnaye 9 the suborder was later recognised as a family rather than a suborder in the late 20th century some ornithologists argued that new world vultures are more closely related to storks on the basis of karyotype 10 morphological 11 and behavioral 12 data thus some authorities placed them in the ciconiiformes family with storks and herons sibley and monroe 1990 even considered them a subfamily of the storks this was criticized 13 14 and an early dna sequence study 15 was based on erroneous data and subsequently retracted 16 17 18 there was then an attempt to raise the new world vultures to the rank of an independent order cathartiformes not closely associated with either the birds of prey or the storks and herons 19 old world vultures edit main article old world vultures the old world vultures found in africa asia and europe belong to

condor vultur gryphus in the andes king vulture sarcoramphus papa from southern mexico to northern argentina feeding edit vultures are scavengers meaning that they eat dead animals outside of the oceans vultures are the only known obligate scavengers 20 they rarely attack healthy animals but may kill the wounded or sick when a carcass has too thick a hide for its beak to open it waits for a larger scavenger to eat first 21 vast numbers have been seen upon battlefields they gorge themselves when prey is abundant until their crops bulge and sit sleepy or half torpid to digest their food these birds do not carry food to their young in their talons but disgorge it from their crops the mountain dwelling bearded vulture is the only vertebrate to specialize in eating bones it carries bones to the nest for the young and hunts some live prey 22 vultures are of great value as scavengers especially in hot regions vulture stomach acid is exceptionally corrosive ph 1 0 22 allowing them to safely digest putrid carcasses infected with botulinum toxin hog cholera bacteria and anthrax bacteria that would be lethal to other scavengers 23 and remove these bacteria from the environment new world vultures often vomit when threatened or approached contrary to some accounts they do not projectile vomit on their attacker in defence but to lighten their stomach load to ease take off the vomited meal residue may distract a predator allowing the bird to escape 24 new world vultures also urinate straight down their legs the uric acid kills bacteria accumulated from walking through carcasses and also acts as evaporative cooling 25 conservation status edit see also indian vulture crisis and african vulture crisis vultures in south asia mainly in india and nepal have declined dramatically since the early 1990s 26 it has been found that this decline was caused by residues of the veterinary drug diclofenac in animal carcasses 27 the government of india has taken very late cognizance of this fact and has banned the drug for animals 28 however it may take decades for vultures to come back to their earlier population level if they ever do without vultures to pick corpses clean rabies carrying dogs have multiplied feeding on the carrion and age old practices like the sky burials of the parsees are coming to an end permanently reducing the supply of corpses 29 the same problem is also seen in nepal where government has taken some late steps to conserve remaining vultures the vulture population is threatened across africa and eurasia there are many anthropogenic activities that threaten vultures such as poisoning and wind energy collision mortality 30 in central africa there have been efforts to conserve the remaining vultures and bring their population numbers back up this is largely due to the bushmeat trade it is estimated that more than 1 10 9 kg 2 2 10 9 lb of wild animal meat is traded and vultures take up a large percentage of this bushmeat due to the demand in the fetish market 31 the substantial drop in vulture populations in the continent of africa is also said to be the result of both intentional and unintentional poisoning with one study finding it to be the cause of 61 of the vulture deaths recorded 32 a recent study in 2016 reported that of the 22 vulture species nine are critically endangered three are endangered four are near threatened and six are least concern 33 the conservation status of vultures is of particular concern to humans for example the decline of vulture populations can lead to increased disease transmission and resource damage through increased populations of disease vector and pest animal populations that scavenge carcasses opportunistically vultures control these pests and disease vectors indirectly through competition for carcasses 34 on 20 june 2019 the corpses of 468 white backed vultures 17 white headed vultures 28 hooded vultures 14 lappet faced vultures and 10 cape vultures altogether 537 vultures besides 2 tawny eagles were found in northern botswana it is suspected that they died after eating the corpses of 3 elephants that were poisoned by poachers possibly to avoid detection by the birds which help rangers to track poaching activity by circling above where there are dead animals 35 36 37 38 in myth and culture edit in ancient egyptian art nekhbet a mythological goddess and patron of both the city of nekheb and upper egypt 39 was depicted as a vulture alan gardiner identified the species that was used in divine iconography as a griffon vulture arielle p kozloff however argues that the vultures in new kingdom art with their blue tipped beaks and loose skin better resemble the lappet faced vulture many great royal wives wore vulture crowns a symbol of protection from the goddess nekhbet 40 ancient egyptians believed that all vultures were female and were spontaneously born from eggs without the intervention of a male and therefore linked the birds to purity and motherhood but also the eternal cycle of death and rebirth for their ability to transform the death they feed on i e carrion and waste into life 41 in pre columbian times vultures were appreciated as extraordinary beings and they had high iconographic status vultures appear in many mesoamerican myths legends and fables with many separate civilizations such as the mayan and aztec developing a range of stories around vultures many mesoamerican stories depict vultures negatively while others contain more positive attitudes 42 the aztec vulture vessel at the new pre columbian

bonnaterre 1789 the orca or killer whale orcinus orca is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family of which it is the largest member it is the only extant species in the genus orcinus and is recognizable by its black and white patterned body a cosmopolitan species orcas can be found in all of the world s oceans in a variety of marine environments from arctic and antarctic regions to tropical seas orcas have a diverse diet although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey some feed exclusively on fish while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin they have been known to attack baleen whale calves and even adult whales orcas are apex predators as they have no natural predators they are highly social some populations are composed of very stable matrilineal family groups pods which are the most stable of any animal species their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations have been described as manifestations of animal culture the international union for conservation of nature assesses the orca s conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more orca types are separate species some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion habitat loss pollution by pcbs capture for marine mammal parks and conflicts with human fisheries in late 2005 the southern resident orcas which swim in british columbia and washington waters were placed on the u s endangered species list wild orcas are not considered a threat to humans and no fatal attack on humans has ever been documented there have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine

originally used orca 10 pl orcae for these animals possibly borrowing ancient greek ὄρυξ óryx this greek word which referred among other things to a whale species perhaps a narwhal 11 as part of the family delphinidae the species is more closely related to other oceanic dolphins than to other whales 12 they are sometimes referred to as blackfish a name also used for other whale species grampus is a former name for the species but is now seldom used this meaning of grampus should not be confused with the genus grampus whose only member is risso s dolphin 13 taxonomy and evolution orcinus citoniensis fossil an extinct species of the same genus museo capellini in bolognamodern orca skeleton naturalis leiden orcinus orca is the only recognized extant species in the genus orcinus and one of many animal species originally described by carl linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of systema naturae 14 konrad gessner wrote the first scientific description of an orca in his piscium aquatilium animantium natura of 1558 part of the larger historia animalium based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the bay of greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest 15 the orca is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family which first appeared about 11 million years ago the orca lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter 16 although it has morphological similarities with the false killer whale the pygmy killer whale and the pilot whales a study of cytochrome b gene sequences indicates that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus orcaella 17 however a more recent 2018 study places the orca as a sister taxon to the lissodelphininae a clade that includes lagenorhynchus and cephalorhynchus 18 in contrast a 2019 phylogenetic study found the orca to be the second most basal member of the delphinidae with only the atlantic white sided dolphin leucopleurus acutus being more basal 19 types further information orca types and populations variations in antarctic orcas the three to five types of orcas may be distinct enough to be considered different races 20 subspecies or possibly even species 21 see species problem the iucn reported in 2008 the taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review and it is likely that o orca will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years 3 although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different orca groups complicate simple differentiation into types 22 research off the west coast of north america has identified fish eating residents mammal eating transients and offshores 23 other populations have not been as well studied although specialized fish and mammal eating orcas have been distinguished elsewhere 24 mammal eating orcas in different regions were long thought likely to be closely related but genetic testing has refuted this hypothesis 25 four types have been documented in the antarctic types a d two dwarf species named orcinus nanus and orcinus glacialis were described during the 1980s by soviet researchers but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status 21 complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two antarctic groups types b and c should be recognized as distinct species as should the north pacific transients leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data 26 a 2019 study of type d orcas also found them to be distinct from other populations and possibly even a unique species 27 appearance and morphology different angle views of a typical killer whale s appearance female orcas are the largest extant members of the dolphin family males typically range from 6 to 8 metres 20 to 26 ft long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes 5 9 long tons 6 6 short tons females are smaller generally ranging from 5 to 7 m 16 to 23 ft and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes 3 0 to 3 9 long tons 3 3 to 4 4 short tons 28 calves at birth weigh about 180 kg 400 lb and are about 2 4 m 7 9 ft long 29 30 the skeleton of the orca is typical for an oceanic dolphin but more robust 31 with their distinctive pigmention 31 adult orcas are seldom confused with any other species 32 when seen from a distance juveniles can be confused with false orcas or risso s dolphins 33 the orca typically has a sharply contrasted black and white body being mostly black on the upper side and white on the underside the entire lower jaw is white and from here the colouration stretches across the underside to the genital area narrowing between the flippers then widening some and extending into lateral flank patches close to the end the tail fluke is also white on the underside while the eyes have white oval shaped patches behind and above them and a grey or white saddle patch exists behind the dorsal fin and across the back 31 34 males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas 35 in newborns the white areas are yellow or orange coloured 31 34 antarctic orcas may have pale grey to nearly white backs 32 some antarctic orcas are brown and yellow due to diatoms in the water 21 both albino and melanistic orcas have been documented 31 differences of dorsal fins between males front and females background orca pectoral fins are large and rounded resembling paddles with those of males significantly larger than those of females dorsal fins also exhibit sexual dimorphism with those of males about 1 8 m 5 9 ft high more than twice the size of the female s with the male s fin more like a tall elongated isosceles triangle whereas the female s is shorter and more curved 36 in the skull adult males have longer lower jaws than females as well as larger occipital crests 37 the snout is blunt and lacks the beak of other species 31 the orca s teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed the firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements 38 orcas have good eyesight above and below the water excellent hearing and a good sense of touch they have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in the water by emitting clicks and listening for echoes 39 as do other members of the dolphin family the mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38 c 97 to 100 f 40 41 like most marine mammals orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7 6 to 10 cm 3 0 to 3 9 in thick beneath the skin 40 the pulse is about 60 heartbeats per minute when the orca is at the surface dropping to 30 beats min when submerged 42 an individual orca can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch variations such as nicks scratches and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of north pacific animals photographic identification has enabled the local population of orcas to be counted each year rather than estimated and has enabled great insight into life cycles and social structures 43 range and habitat further information orca types and populations an orca leaps out of the water when swimming a behaviour known as porpoising in hood canal type b orcas off south georgia island orcas are found in all oceans and most seas due to their enormous range numbers and density relative distribution is difficult to estimate 44 but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments 45 areas which serve as major study sites for the species include the coasts of iceland norway the valdes peninsula of argentina the crozet islands new zealand and parts of the west coast of north america from california to alaska 46 systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of orcas 0 40 individuals per 100 km2 in the northeast atlantic around the norwegian coast in the north pacific along the aleutian islands the gulf of alaska and in the southern ocean off much of the coast of antarctica they are considered common 0 20 0 40 individuals per 100 km2 in the eastern pacific along the coasts of british columbia washington and oregon in the north atlantic ocean around iceland and the faroe islands 44 in the antarctic orcas range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice finding open leads much like beluga whales in the arctic however orcas are merely seasonal visitors to arctic waters and do not approach the pack ice in the summer with the rapid arctic sea ice decline in the hudson strait their range now extends deep into the northwest atlantic 47 occasionally orcas swim into freshwater rivers they have been documented 100 mi 160 km up the columbia river in the united states 48 49 they have also been found in the fraser river in canada and the horikawa river in japan 48 migration patterns are poorly understood each summer the same individuals appear off the coasts of british columbia and washington despite decades of research where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown transient pods have been sighted from southern alaska to central california 50 population worldwide population estimates are uncertain but recent consensus suggests a minimum of 50 000 2006 51 3 52 local estimates include roughly 25 000 in the antarctic 8 500 in the tropical pacific 2 250 2 700 off the cooler northeast pacific and 500 1 500 off norway 53 japan s fisheries agency estimated in the 2000s that 2 321 orcas were in the seas around japan 54 55 feeding tail slapping in vestfjorden norwayresident orca pursuing a chinook orcas are apex predators meaning that they themselves have no natural predators they are sometimes called wolves of the sea because they hunt in groups like wolf packs 56 orcas hunt varied prey including fish cephalopods mammals seabirds and sea turtles 57 different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on prey species 58 however whales in tropical areas appear to have more generalized diets due to lower food productivity 59 60 orcas spend most of their time at shallow depths 61 but occasionally dive several hundred metres depending on their prey 62 63 fish fish eating orcas prey on around 30 species of fish some populations in the norwegian and greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish s autumnal migration to the norwegian coast salmon account for 96 of northeast pacific residents diet including 65 of large fatty chinook 64 chum salmon are also eaten but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item depletion of specific prey species in an area is therefore cause for concern for local populations despite the high diversity of prey 51 on average an orca eats 227 kilograms 500 lb each day 65 while salmon are usually hunted by an individual whale or a small group herring are often caught using carousel feeding the orcas force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides they then slap the ball with their tail flukes stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time then eating them one by one carousel feeding has only been documented in the norwegian orca population as well as some oceanic dolphin species 66 in new zealand sharks and rays appear to be important prey including eagle rays long tail and short tail stingrays common threshers smooth hammerheads blue sharks basking sharks and shortfin makos 67 68 with sharks orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes 67 while bottom dwelling rays are cornered pinned to the ground and taken to the surface 69 in other parts of the world orcas have preyed on broadnose sevengill sharks 70 small whale sharks 71 and even great white sharks 70 72 competition between orcas and white sharks is probable in regions where their diets overlap 73 the arrival of orcas in an area can cause white sharks to flee and forage elsewhere 74 75 orcas appear to target the liver of sharks 70 72 mammals and birds orcas are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals they are recorded to prey on other cetacean species usually smaller dolphins and porpoises such as common dolphins bottlenose dolphins pacific white sided dolphins dusky dolphins harbour porpoises and dall s porpoises 76 34 while hunting these species orcas usually have to chase them to exhaustion for highly social species orca pods try to separate an individual from its group larger groups have a better chance of preventing their prey from escaping which is killed by being thrown around rammed and jumped on arctic orcas may attack beluga whales and narwhals stuck in pools enclosed by sea ice the former are also driven into shallower water where juveniles are grabbed 76 by contrast orcas appear to be wary of pilot whales which have been recorded to mob and chase them 77 orca attacking a strap toothed beaked whale orcas also prey on larger species such as sperm whales grey whales and humpback whales 76 in 2019 orcas were recorded to have killed a blue whale on three separate occasions off the south coast of western australia including an estimated 18 22 meters 59 72 ft individual 78 large whales require much effort and coordination to kill and orcas often target calves a hunt begins with a chase followed by a violent attack on the exhausted prey large whales often show signs of orca attack via tooth rake marks 76 pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards using them to repel the attackers 79 there is also evidence that humpback whales will defend against or mob orcas who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species 80 prior to the advent of industrial whaling great whales may have been the major food source for orcas the introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided orcas by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating the availability of prey to scavenge and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float thus exposing them to scavenging however the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for orcas and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals thus contributing to the decline of these as well 81 orca beaching to capture sea lion at valdes peninsula orcas swimming in close synchronization to create a wave to wash the seal off the ice floe other marine mammal prey include seals particularly harbour seals elephant seals california sea lions steller sea lions south american sea lions and walruses 76 34 often to avoid injury orcas disable their prey before killing and eating it this may involve throwing it in the air slapping it with their tails ramming it or breaching and landing on it 82 in steeply banked beaches off península valdés argentina and the crozet islands orcas feed on sea lions and elephant seals in shallow water even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea beaching usually fatal to cetaceans is not an instinctive behaviour and can require years of practice for the young 83 orcas can then release the animal near juvenile whales allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now weakened prey 82 84 wave hunting orcas spy hop to locate weddell seals crabeater seals and leopard seals resting on ice floes and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe this washes the prey into the water where other orcas lie in wait 85 86 87 in the aleutian islands a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to orca predation although with no direct evidence 88 the decline of sea otters followed a decline in seal populations a 90 which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey now decimated by industrial whaling 91 92 93 orcas have been observed preying on terrestrial mammals such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of north america 89 orca cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers 94 one orca was also attacked by its companions after being shot 24 although resident orcas have never been observed to eat other marine mammals they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason 95 orcas do consume seabirds but are more likely to kill and leave them uneaten penguin species recorded as prey in antarctic and sub antarctic waters include gentoo penguins chinstrap penguins king penguins and rockhopper penguins 96 orcas in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls 97 a captive orca at marineland of canada discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface attracting sea gulls and then eat the birds four others then learned to copy the behaviour 98 behaviour orcas like this one near alaska commonly breach often lifting their entire bodies out of the water day to day orca behaviour generally consists of foraging travelling resting and socializing orcas frequently engage in surface behaviour such as breaching jumping completely out of the water and tail slapping these activities may have a variety of purposes such as courtship communication dislodging parasites or play spyhopping is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings 99 resident orcas swim alongside porpoises and other dolphins 100 social structure orcas are notable for their complex societies only elephants and higher primates live in comparably complex social structures 101 due to orcas complex social bonds many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep them in captivity 102 resident orcas in the eastern north pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups unlike any other known mammal social structure resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives these family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female matriarch and her sons and daughters and the descendants of her daughters etc the average size of a matriline is 5 5 animals because females can reach age 90 as many as four generations travel together these matrilineal groups are highly stable individuals separate for only a few hours at a time to mate or forage with one exception an orca named luna no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded 103 a pair of orcas in the pacific northwest closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods usually consisting of one to four matrilines unlike matrilines pods may separate for weeks or months at a time 103 dna testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods 104 clans the next level of resident social structure are composed of pods with similar dialects and common but older maternal heritage clan ranges overlap mingling pods from different clans 103 the highest association layer is the community which consists of pods that regularly associate with each other but share no maternal relations or dialects 105 transient pods are smaller than resident pods typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females these bonds can extend well into adulthood unlike residents extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating some males become rovers and do not form long term associations occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females 106 as in resident clans transient community members share an acoustic repertoire although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted 107 as with residents and transients the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet fish eating orcas off norway have resident like social structures while mammal eating orcas in argentina and the crozet islands behave more like transients 108 orcas of the same sex and age group may engage in physical contact and synchronous surfacing these behaviours do not occur randomly among individuals in a pod providing evidence of friendships 109 110 vocalizations multimedia relating to the orca orca calls orca calls at a distance vocalizations of an orca problems playing these files see media help see also whale sound like all cetaceans orcas depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation feeding and communication they produce three categories of sounds clicks whistles and pulsed calls clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment but are also commonly heard during social interactions 52 northeast pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters 111 residents feed primarily on chinook and chum salmon which are insensitive to orca calls inferred from the audiogram of atlantic salmon in contrast the marine mammal prey of transients hear whale calls well and thus transients are typically silent 111 vocal behaviour in these whales is mainly limited to surfacing activities and milling slow swimming with no apparent direction after a kill 112 all members of a resident pod use similar calls known collectively as a dialect dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete repetitive calls they are complex and stable over time 113 call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines 114 newborns produce calls similar to their mothers but have a more limited repertoire 107 individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with pod members 115 family specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf s birth which may help the calf learn them 116 dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods with variation growing over time 117 when pods meet dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase the use of both call types is called biphonation the increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter pod relations 114 dialects also distinguish types resident dialects contain seven to 17 mean 11 distinctive call types all members of the north american west coast transient community express the same basic dialect although minor regional variation in call types is evident preliminary research indicates offshore orcas have group specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients 117 norwegian and icelandic herring eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting 118 a population that live in mcmurdo sound antarctica have 28 complex burst pulse and whistle calls 119 intelligence main article cetacean intelligence orcas have the second heaviest brains among marine mammals 120 after sperm whales which have the largest brain of any animal 121 they can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent 122 123 although defining and measuring intelligence is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans 123 orcas imitate others and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin off the crozet islands mothers push their calves onto the beach waiting to pull the youngster back if needed 82 84 an orca plays with a ball of ice soon after a researcher threw a snowball at the whale people who have interacted closely with orcas offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales curiosity playfulness and ability to solve problems alaskan orcas have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys 124 once fishermen placed their boats several miles apart taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved the tactic worked initially but the orcas figured it out quickly and split into groups 124 in other anecdotes researchers describe incidents in which wild orcas playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach 125 or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball 126 the orca s use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture 127 the complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales orcinus orca appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties 128 life cycle mother orca with calf near south georgia female orcas begin to mature at around the age of 10 and reach peak fertility around 20 129 experiencing periods of polyestrous cycling separated by non cycling periods of three to 16 months females can often breed until age 40 followed by a rapid decrease in fertility 129 orcas are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding 130 131 the lifespans of wild females average 50 to 80 years 132 some are claimed to have lived substantially longer granny j2 was estimated by some researchers to have been as old as 105 years at the time of her death though a biopsy sample indicated her age as 65 to 80 years 133 134 135 it is thought that orcas held in captivity tend to have shorter lives than those in the wild although this is subject to scientific debate 132 136 137 males mate with females from other pods which prevents inbreeding gestation varies from 15 to 18 months 138 mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years in resident pods births occur at any time of year although winter is the most common mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life when 37 50 of all calves die 139 weaning begins at about 12 months of age and is complete by two years according to observations in several regions all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young 101 males sexually mature at the age of 15 but do not typically reproduce until age 21 wild males live around 29 years on average with a maximum of about 60 years 133 one male known as old tom was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off new south wales australia which would have made him up to 90 years old examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35 140 but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals 141 one male known to researchers in the pacific northwest identified as j1 was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010 142 orcas are unique among cetaceans as their caudal sections elongate with age making their heads relatively shorter 37 infanticide once thought to occur only in captive orcas was observed in wild populations by researchers off british columbia on december 2 2016 in this incident an adult male killed the calf of a female within the same pod with the adult male s mother also joining in the assault it is theorized that the male killed the young calf in order to mate with its mother something that occurs in other carnivore species while the male s mother supported the breeding opportunity for her son the attack ended when the calf s mother struck and injured the attacking male such behaviour matches that of many smaller dolphin species such as the bottlenose dolphin 143 conservation the type c orca has two toned grey colouring including a dark dorsal cape in body areas where most orcas have solid black colouring research is ongoing into whether one or more orca types are distinct species in need of protection in 2008 the iucn international union for conservation of nature changed its assessment of the orca s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient recognizing that one or more orca types may actually be separate endangered species 3 depletion of prey species pollution large scale oil spills and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats 3 in january 2020 the first orca in england and wales since 2001 was found dead with a large fragment of plastic in its stomach 144 like other animals at the highest trophic levels the orca is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins including polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 145 european harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of pcbs and related contaminants and a survey off the washington coast found pcb levels in orcas were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals 145 blubber samples in the norwegian arctic show higher levels of pcbs pesticides and brominated flame retardants than in polar bears a 2018 study published in science found that global orca populations are poised to dramatically decline due such toxic pollution 146 147 in the pacific northwest wild salmon stocks a main resident food source have declined dramatically in recent years 3 in the puget sound region only 75 whales remain with few births over the last few years 148 on the west coast of alaska and the aleutian islands seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined 149 an adult female and her calf in 2005 the united states government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the endangered species act 52 this community comprises three pods which live mostly in the georgia and haro straits and puget sound in british columbia and washington they do not breed outside of their community which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90 150 in october 2008 the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead reducing the count to 83 151 this is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past 10 years these deaths can be attributed to declines in chinook salmon 151 scientist ken balcomb has extensively studied orcas since 1976 he is the research biologist responsible for discovering u s navy sonar may harm orcas he studied orcas from the center for whale research located in friday harbor washington 152 he was also able to study orcas from his home porch perched above puget sound where the animals hunt and play in summer months 152 in may 2003 balcomb along with other whale watchers near the puget sound coastline noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the orcas the whales seemed agitated and were moving haphazardly attempting to lift their heads free of the water to escape the sound of the sonars 152 balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar the sound originated from a u s navy frigate 12 miles 19 kilometres distant balcomb said 152 the impact of sonar waves on orcas is potentially life threatening three years prior to balcomb s discovery research in the bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore these whales were beached on the day u s navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise 152 of the 14 whales beached six of them died these six dead whales were studied and cat scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears which is consistent with decompression sickness 152 another conservation concern was made public in september 2008 when the canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections including the species at risk act in place to protect endangered animals along with their habitats for orcas aside from the laws already in place in response to this decision six environmental groups sued the federal government claiming orcas were facing many threats on the british columbia coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats 153 a legal and scientific nonprofit organization ecojustice led the lawsuit and represented the david suzuki foundation environmental defence greenpeace canada international fund for animal welfare the raincoast conservation foundation and the wilderness committee 153 many scientists involved in this lawsuit including bill wareham a marine scientist with the david suzuki foundation noted increased boat traffic water toxic wastes and low salmon population as major threats putting approximately 87 orcas on the british columbia coast in danger 153 underwater noise from shipping drilling and other human activities is a significant concern in some key orca habitats including johnstone strait and haro strait 154 in the mid 1990s loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals orcas also avoided the surrounding waters 155 high intensity sonar used by the navy disturbs orcas along with other marine mammals 156 orcas are popular with whale watchers which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel 157 the exxon valdez oil spill adversely affected orcas in prince william sound and alaska s kenai fjords region eleven members about half of one resident pod disappeared in the following year the spill damaged salmon and other prey populations which in turn damaged local orcas by 2009 scientists estimated the at1 transient population considered part of a larger population of 346 transients numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill this population is expected to die out 158 159 orcas are included in appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered species cites meaning international trade including in parts derivatives is regulated 4 relationship with humans indigenous cultures see also animal worship haida sculpture by bill reid the indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast feature orcas throughout their art history spirituality and religion the haida regarded orcas as the most powerful animals in the ocean and their mythology tells of orcas living in houses and towns under the sea according to these myths they took on human form when submerged and humans who drowned went to live with them 160 for the kwakwaka wakw the orca was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors 160 in nuu chah nulth and kwakwaka wakw mythology orcas may embody the souls of deceased chiefs 160 the tlingit of southeastern alaska regarded the orca as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans 161 the maritime archaic people of newfoundland also had great respect for orcas as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4 000 year old burial at the port au choix archaeological site 162 163 in the tales and beliefs of the siberian yupik people orcas are said to appear as wolves in winter and wolves as orcas in summer 164 165 166 167 orcas are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus 168 reverence is expressed in several forms the boat represents the animal and a wooden carving hung from the hunter s belt 166 small sacrifices such as tobacco or meat are strewn into the sea for them 168 167 the ainu people of hokkaido the kuril islands and southern sakhalin often referred to orcas in their folklore and myth as repun kamuy god of sea offshore to bring fortunes whales to the coasts and there had been traditional funerals for stranded or deceased orcas akin to funerals for other animals such as brown bears 169 killer stereotype main article orca attack in western cultures orcas were historically feared as dangerous savage predators 170 the first written description of an orca was given by pliny the elder circa ad 70 who wrote orcas the appearance of which no image can express other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth are the enemy of other kinds of whale they charge and pierce them like warships ramming 171 male orca depicted in st mary s in greifswald germany 1545 15 of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild orcas none have been fatal 172 in one instance orcas tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the terra nova expedition were standing 173 the sled dogs barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the orca s hunting curiosity in the 1970s a surfer in california was bitten and in 2005 a boy in alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbour seals was bumped by an orca that apparently misidentified him as prey 174 unlike wild orcas captive orcas have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s some of which have been fatal 175 176 competition with fishermen also led to orcas being regarded as pests in the waters of the pacific northwest and iceland the shooting of orcas was accepted and even encouraged by governments 170 as an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently about 25 of the orcas captured in puget sound for aquariums through 1970 bore bullet scars 177 the u s navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of orcas in icelandic waters in 1956 with machine guns rockets and depth charges 178 179 from july to october 2020 there were at least forty reliable reports of orcas attacking boats off the atlantic coast of portugal and spain unusual and unprecedented behaviour the nudging biting and ramming attacks on medium size sailing boats sailing at moderate speed concentrated on the rudder with some impacts on the hull a small group of orcas are believed to be responsible with three juveniles which have been named black gladis white gladis and grey gladis identified as present in most attacks no one was injured in any of the attacks the portuguese coastguard banned small sailing vessels from a region where several incidents had been reported it is thought that the behaviour is playful rather than aggressive or vengeful 180 the attacks became more frequent between 2020 and 2022 in july 2022 the orcas sank a sailboat with five people on board and disabled another off the coast of portugal 181 modern western attitudes see also orcas in popular culture ingrid visser s research team filming orcas in new zealand western attitudes towards orcas have changed dramatically in recent decades in the mid 1960s and early 1970s orcas came to much greater public and scientific awareness starting with the live capture and display of an orca known as moby doll a southern resident orca harpooned off saturna island in 1964 170 he was the first ever orca to be studied at close quarters alive not postmortem moby doll s impact in scientific research at the time including the first scientific studies of an orca s sound production led to two articles about him in the journal zoologica 182 183 so little was known at the time it was nearly two months before the whale s keepers discovered what food fish it was willing to eat to the surprise of those who saw him moby doll was a docile non aggressive whale who made no attempts to attack humans 184 in 2002 the orphan springer was successfully returned to her family between 1964 and 1976 50 orcas from the pacific northwest were captured for display in aquaria and public interest in the animals grew in the 1970s research pioneered by michael bigg led to the discovery of the species complex social structure its use of vocal communication and its extraordinarily stable mother offspring bonds through photo identification techniques individuals were named and tracked over decades 185 bigg s techniques also revealed the pacific northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed 170 the southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity by 1976 only 80 remained 186 in the pacific northwest the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades 150 the public s growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale keeping in aquarium only one whale has been taken in north american waters since 1976 in recent years the extent of the public s interest in orcas has manifested itself in several high profile efforts surrounding individuals following the success of the 1993 film free willy the movie s captive star keiko was returned to the coast of his native iceland in 2002 the director of the international marine mammal project for the earth island institute david phillips led the efforts to return keiko to the iceland waters 187 keiko however did not adapt to the harsh climate of the arctic ocean and died a year into his release after contracting pneumonia at the age of 27 188 in 2002 the orphan springer was discovered in puget sound washington she became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region s orcas 189 the saving of springer raised hopes that another young orca named luna which had become separated from his pod could be returned to it however his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene and in 2006 luna was killed by a boat propeller 190 whaling main article whaling the orca named old tom swims alongside a whaleboat flanking a whale calf the boat is being towed by a harpooned whale not visible here near eden australia the earlier of known records of commercial hunting of orcas date to the 18th century in japan during the 19th and early 20th centuries the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales but largely ignored orcas because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil their smaller populations and the difficulty of taking them 104 once the stocks of larger species were depleted orcas were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid 20th century between 1954 and 1997 japan took 1 178 orcas although the ministry of the environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1 600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s 191 and norway took 987 192 extensive hunting of orcas including an antarctic catch of 916 in 1979 80 alone prompted the international whaling commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research 192 today no country carries out a substantial hunt although indonesia and greenland permit small subsistence hunts see aboriginal whaling other than commercial hunts orcas were hunted along japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries such cases include a semi resident male female pair in akashi strait and harimanada being killed in the seto inland sea in 1957 193 194 the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into tokyo bay in 1970 195 and a catch record in southern taiwan in the 1990s 196 197 cooperation with humans orcas have helped humans hunting other whales 198 one well known example was the orcas of eden australia including the male known as old tom whalers more often considered them a nuisance however as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers catch 198 some populations such as in alaska s prince william sound may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation 20 whale watching whale watching continues to increase in popularity but may have some problematic impacts on orcas exposure to exhaust gases from large amounts of vessel traffic is causing concern for the overall health of the 75 remaining southern resident orcas srkws left as of early 2019 199 this population is followed by approximately 20 vessels for 12 hours a day during the months may september 200 researchers discovered that these vessels are in the line of sight for these whales for 98 99 5 of daylight hours 200 with so many vessels the air quality around these whales deteriorates and impacts their health air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome p450 1a gene family 200 researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales a direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility a modelling study determined that the lowest observed adverse effect level loael of exhaust pollutants was about 12 of the human dose 200 as a response to this in 2017 boats off the british columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres this new rule complements washington state s minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011 if a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes the world health organization has set air quality standards in an effort to control the emissions produced by these vessels 201 captivity main article captive orcas lolita at the miami seaquarium is one of the oldest whales in captivity the orca s intelligence trainability striking appearance playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks from 1976 to 1997 55 whales were taken from the wild in iceland 19 from japan and three from argentina these figures exclude animals that died during capture live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s and by 1999 about 40 of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive born 202 organizations such as world animal protection and the whale and dolphin conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity in captivity they often develop pathologies such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60 90 of captive males captives have vastly reduced life expectancies on average only living into their 20s b that said a 2015 study coauthored by staff at seaworld and the minnesota zoo suggested no significant difference in survivorship between free ranging and captive orcas 136 however in the wild females who survive infancy live 46 years on average and up to 70 80 years in rare cases wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average and up to 50 60 years 203 captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat and captive whales social groups are foreign to those found in the wild critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behaviour see above 204 wild orcas may travel up to 160 kilometres 100 mi in a day and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity 122 captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves their tankmates or humans which critics say is a result of stress 175 between 1991 and 2010 the bull orca known as tilikum was involved in the death of three people and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film blackfish 205 tilikum lived at seaworld from 1992 until his death in 2017 206 207 in march 2016 seaworld announced that they would be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows 208 as of 2020 theatrical shows featuring orcas are still

the free encyclopedia jump to navigation jump to search for other uses see virago disambiguation bronze of a young female warrior in lombard costume francesco porzio monumento alla difesa di casale 1897 a virago is a woman who demonstrates abundant masculine virtues the word comes from the latin word virāgō genitive virāginis meaning vigorous 1 from vir meaning man or man like cf virile and virtue to which the suffix āgō is added a suffix that creates a new noun of the third declension with feminine grammatical gender historically this was often positive and reflected heroism and exemplary qualities of masculinity however it could also be pejorative indicating a woman who is masculine to the exclusion of traditional feminine virtues modern use of the word virago generally takes the disparaging sense thus virago joined pejoratives such as termagant 2 mannish amazonian and shrew to describe women who acted aggressively or like men the word virago has almost always had an association with cultural gender transgression there are recorded instances of viragos such as joan of arc fighting battles wearing men s clothing or receiving the tonsure 3 contents 1 history 2 vulgate bible 3 see also 4 references 5 bibliography history edit historically the concept of a virago reaches back into antiquity where hellenistic philosophy asserted that elite and exceptionally heroic men had virtus greek ἀνδρεία romanized andreia virtus once again linked to vir the brave man abiding by society s highest values and ethics as opposed to homo human being defined the traits of excellence for a man in ancient rome and greece including valor and heroism but also morality and physical strength women and non elite or unheroic men slaves servants craftsmen merchants were considered a lesser category and believed to be less excellent in roman morality a woman however if exceptional enough could earn the title virago in doing so she surpassed the expectations for what was believed possible for her gender and embodied masculine like aggression 4 and or excellence virago then was a title of respect and admiration in christianity a nun or holy woman who had become equal in divinity to male monks through practiced celibacy exemplary religious practice and devotion and intact virginity was considered to have surpassed the limitations of her femaleness and was called virago 5 6 latin writer firmicus maternus in the 4th century ce describes virago as women who take on a man s character and desire intercourse with women like men 7 standard modern dictionaries define virago as either in order of definition 1 a loud overbearing woman a shrew 8 or 2 a woman of great stature strength and courage 2 9 thus virago continues to be associated with both the naming of a woman who has either 1 a domineering abrasive and spiteful manner or 2 has risen above cultural and gender stereotypes to embody a virile heroism for example the british royal navy christened at least four warships virago vulgate bible edit the vulgate bible translated by jerome and others in the 4th century c e was an early latin translation of the hebrew bible old testament in genesis 2 23

his accomplice and lover the character s alias is a play on the stock character harlequin from the 16th century theater commedia dell arte following her introduction to the dc universe in 1999 harley quinn was depicted as a frequent accomplice and lover of the joker as well as the best friend of fellow supervillain poison ivy later stories depicted quinn as a supervillain who has left her abusive relationship with the joker behind beginning with the publication of her first ongoing series written by karl kesel in 2000 after years of scarce appearances in comics quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the gotham city sirens series as part of an unstable alliance with poison ivy and catwoman in 2011 dc s line wide reboot the new 52 reintroduced quinn in the relaunched suicide squad

timm harley quinn was created by paul dini and bruce timm for the 1992 batman the animated series episode entitled joker s favor while dini was writing the episode 7 initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk on role harley quinn was intended to appear in just one episode 8 9 as dini was putting together the story for the episode he wanted to introduce a foil for the supervillain joker dini recalled the way i created her was i was writing a story called joker s favor and it was my first joker story and i wanted to make it good and i wanted to make the joker everything he is in the better comics books which is funny and scary and egotistical and i thought maybe a foil would bring out some of those personality traits 10 11 he then thought of giving joker a female henchperson inspired by the molls of the 1960s live action batman series 9 12 13 and then decided she would be a funny counterpart to the joker to maybe work up a little punch and judy attitude between them 10 dini stated she could crack a joke and the henchmen would laugh and the joker would kind of glare at her 14 in 1991 after seeing his college friend arleen sorkin play a roller skating jester from a dream sequence in the soap opera days of our lives dini decided to have sorkin voice her 10 13 dini then partly based harley quinn on sorkin with dini incorporating aspects of sorkin such as her very snappy wisecracking bubbly blonde personality into the character as well as her mannerisms 14 11 10 in recording harley quinn s voice sorkin spoke in her normal brooklyn accent while putting in a little yiddish sound since dini made the character jewish another aspect of the character borrowed from sorkin 13 15 16 17 external mediaimages paul dini s original design for harley quinn a crazy blond character in a miniskirt based on actress barbara eden and 1940s screwballs such as betty hutton gloria grahame and claudette colbert 14 18 video the dream sequence from the show days of our lives in which arleen sorkin plays a jester which served as inspiration for the character s creation dini came across the scene while watching a vhs tape of sorkin s favorite days moments given to dini by sorkin 10 13 dini had several names in mind while naming the character such as columbine and eventually settled on the name harley quinn 19 dini chose the name for the character to be in line with other batman characters s names being puns and also because he thought harley was a fun name for a girl 20 14 the name harley quinn is a play on harlequin a stock character from the sixteenth century italian physical comedy theater commedia dell arte 9 21 in designing the character timm did a simplified supervillain version of traditional harlequin gear from the commedia dell arte original he took the jester hat ruffled collar diamond pattern and domino mask and put them on a red and black bodysuit on which the diamonds were strategically placed for easier animation 9 16 timm took harley quinn s red and black motif from the golden age comic book character daredevil 9 dini had previously made a rough design for the character which timm improved on 13 expanded role eventually each of the directors wanted to do a harley episode so the character began to appear in stories without the joker over the years she allied herself with best gal pal poison ivy for occasional romps through gotham and has even succeeded in giving batman a hard time on her own we now look upon harley as our series wild card capable of showing up anytime to bedevil our heroes with her screwball antics paul dini 11 the more we used harley and the more we used her in different roles the more we discovered what a richer character she was she just blossomed in a very short time to the point where she was just as interesting as catwoman or penguin or ra s al ghul or one of the other core batman characters paul dini 14 after seeing harley quinn in the rough cut of joker s favor the producers of batman the animated series which include dini and timm were impressed with the result with dini wanting to bring the character back for more episodes 22 9 timm and another producer alan burnett were initially reluctant of this and thought that giving joker a girlfriend played more towards his comedic side and would humanize him too much which contrasted their vision for joker as a character who is as serious a threat as possible to batman 22 9 nevertheless months after joker s favor harley made a second appearance on the show in the episode the laughing fish and became the joker s love interest 9 harley quinn gained popularity with fans of the animated series with the character being featured more on the show and eventually starring in her own episodes such as 1993 s harley and ivy which introduced a friendship between harley quinn and fellow supervillain poison ivy and 1994 s harlequinade and harley s holiday which explored harley quinn s life without the joker 23 24 25 harley quinn then became a recurring character in the dc animated universe appearing in the animated series sequel the new batman adventures and in non batman animation such as superman the animated series static shock and justice league on february 7 1994 she made her first appearance in a video game in the adventures of batman and robin an action platformer based on batman the animated series 26 27 transition to comic books tango with evil by alex ross from the cover of harley s canonical debut batman harley quinn widely described as iconic the artwork depicts harley dancing with a tuxedo clad joker and was later recreated in the 2016 film suicide squad 28 22 29 30 31 32 because of her popularity harley quinn was adapted into dc s comic books 33 in september 1993 a year following harley quinn s first appearance in batman the animated series the character made her comic book debut in the twelfth issue of the batman adventures a series set in the universe of the animated series and became a regular character 6 7 in 1997 she appeared in the story batman thrillkiller released under elseworlds a dc comics imprint that published out of continuity alternate reality stories as hayley fitzpatrick 6 in 1999 she became a canonical character with the release of batman harley quinn 1 6 origin story main article the batman adventures mad love bruce and i were talking about what if there was some sort of surprise to her origin what if she s not just a hench girl we came up with the idea that she had been a doctor at arkham asylum and the joker had gotten into her head and worked her into being his follower then we thought what if harley s in the role of the long suffering girlfriend paul dini about the creation of mad love 14 in february 1994 the one shot the batman adventures mad love recounting harley s origin was released written by dini and drawn by timm the story marks their first comic book collaboration 22 mad love introduces harley quinn as a former psychiatrist named harleen quinzel who fell in love with the joker during her internship at gotham city s arkham asylum and details her transformation into the joker s villainous accomplice harley quinn as well as the joker s lack of respect for harley 22 24 34 35 widely considered the definitive harley quinn story 36 37 38 mad love added dimensions to the character with dini introducing harley quinn s motivations as well as establishing her as a tragic figure and sympathetic villain 39 40 41 42 43 the story received wide praise and won the eisner and harvey awards for best single issue in the same year and was later adapted into an episode of the same name in the new batman adventures in 1999 44 45 25 name origin harley quinn s actual name is established in mad love as harleen frances quinzel harleen frances was borrowed by dini from sorkin s first and middle name arleen frances quinzel was taken from a former teacher of dini s from emerson college named quenzel 14 introduction to main dc continuity harley quinn was adapted into the main dc universe with the 1999 one shot graphic novel batman harley quinn written by dini and illustrated by yvel guichet 46 which put her origin in the middle of the no man s land storyline 47 dini changed harley and joker s relationship to be darker to match joker s character in the comics in the story joker attempts to kill harley at the first opportunity dini also gave harley new abilities such as immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility which she received after having been injected a special formula by poison ivy these changes were made to match the needs of the dc universe on her new abilities dini said i figured if she d be going head to head with batman and the other dc heroes harley would need some kind of physical edge 22 46 first ongoing series the series is an interesting assignment because the main character is a insane and b a criminal and both of these things are pretty essential to the character so we don t want to get rid of either of them we hammered out a direction for the book which will establish a motivation and agenda for harley depending on the storyline she will be on the side of the angels sometimes and on the side of the demons and devils on others like most great crime characters she s not concerned with the law what concerns her is something totally different what that is will be revealed as the first half dozen issues progress karl kesel 2000 48 while pursuing new assignments at dc comics offices in new york city karl kesel was approached by former dc editor matt idelson to create a pitch for harley quinn s first ongoing series which karl accepted being a fan of the character after having read dini s mad love 22 kesel chose terry dodson as the artist for the series whose art kesel thought complemented the character s cartoonish roots and worldview 22 49 kesel called dodson and asked him if he was interested on working on the comic to which dodson agreed and the two worked for a month on their proposal for the series which was to make a comic about love gone horribly terribly wrong 49 22 the proposal was accepted by dc comics and the pair began work on the series with kesel and dodson both being involved in the storytelling and dodson bringing in his wife rachel dodson to ink 22 kesel s run on the series began being published in december 2000 and was about harley quinn leaving the joker and becoming a solo criminal alongside a supporting cast of henchmen named the quinntets 22 because of underwhelming sales his 25 issue run ended in december 2002 and dc decided to change the creative team the series was given to writer a j lieberman and artists mike huddleston and troy nixey by idelson and took on a grittier and darker direction contrasting kesel s run 50 the decision renewed interest in the character but the sales remained lackluster and the series was cancelled in 2003 50 13 gotham city sirens main article gotham city sirens after years of scarce appearances in comics harley quinn resurfaced in a leading role in july 2009 with gotham city sirens a team up title created by dini 51 6 13 the series brought together batman s most popular female villains harley quinn catwoman and poison ivy in an unstable alliance 52 53 54 the series also expanded on harley quinn s background and early life in gotham city sirens 7 dini established the character s hometown being brooklyn and also introduced her dysfunctional family with her swindling father being described as the main reason for her pursuing psychiatry 55 56 57 the first several issues of gotham city sirens were written by dini and illustrated by guillem march other creatives who worked for the series include writers tony bedard and peter calloway and artists david lópez andres guinaldo peter nguyen jeremy haun and ramon bachs 53 the series was cancelled in august 2011 for the new 52 dc comics relaunch of their entire comic line 54 the new 52 suicide squad one thing that we re trying to show with her and i don t think it gets played with enough with harley is here s a woman who was a very intelligent and very manipulative doctor we re trying to play up that quality she is crazy but there is something behind the madness in the new dcu maybe everyone doesn t get shipped off to arkham asylum some people may have to do hard time and get shipped off to belle reve the prison the suicide squad operates out of and her presence here doesn t mean she hasn t been or won t end up in arkham basically we needed a bad girl character and the best bad girl character in the dcu is harley quinn adam glass 2011 58 as part of the new 52 reboot in september 2011 harley quinn was reintroduced by adam glass as a prominent member of the supervillain team task force x in the relaunched suicide squad series 24 59 the character was heavily redesigned to fit the tone of the book her color motif was changed to red and blue her jester costume was replaced with a revealing ensemble consisting of a corset and hot pants her skin was bleached white and her previously blonde hair was altered to half blue and half red 60 13 59 61 her personality had also been depicted to be more violent and psychopathic than her former iteration 13 33 59 external image the controversial cover artwork for suicide squad vol 4 1 which introduced harley quinn s revealing look for the relaunched title 13 art by ryan benjamin in the series glass separated harley quinn from the joker and explored her becom ing her own person with the suicide squad becoming a family to her 62 63 glass stated harley s always wanted to belong to something and if not joker then the team and she s finding herself in all this she s finding her place in the world that she s not just a sidekick 63 suicide squad was cancelled in april 2014 to coincide with the conclusion of the forever evil storyline 64 new origin in the seventh issue of suicide squad glass revised harley quinn s origin story making it reflect the joker s origins in the story the joker takes harleen quinzel to the chemical plant where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will which bleaches her skin and drives her insane resulting in her transformation to harley quinn similar to the joker s transformation in his origins 65 this origin was received negatively by fans of the character who felt that its removal of harley quinn s choice to become the joker s accomplice herself as depicted in her previous origin stories took out an essential part of her character 65 second ongoing series textless cover art of the series first issue featuring harley quinn s roller derby inspired costume harley quinn co creator bruce timm said of the design i really like amanda s design a lot because it s modern and a little bit punk rock but it s really fun without being trashy i think the whole roller derby look is really fun because it s tough but it s still playful it s not it s not skanky 22 art by amanda conner and paul mounts harley quinn s second ongoing series written by husband and wife jimmy palmiotti and amanda conner with the interior art illustrated by chad hardin and john timms explored harley quinn leaving gotham city and starting her own life in her hometown of brooklyn depicting her as a landlord in coney island where she shares an apartment building with a supporting cast of sideshow freaks 66 13 67 68 69 considered to be the most defining writers to work on the character since dini and timm palmiotti and conner reinvented harley quinn as an antihero who has left her controlling relationship with the joker behind 24 70 71 in contrast to harley quinn s depiction in glass suicide squad palmiotti and conner wrote harley quinn with a lighthearted cartoonish and humorous tone her costume has also been changed with a roller derby inspired costume designed by conner which incorporates conner s favorite aspects of harley quinn s early costume and her costume in glass suicide squad 68 72 66 the series also brought back harley quinn s red and black motif 61 the series began being published in november 2013 starting with harley quinn 0 which brought together seventeen comic book artists including harley quinn co creator bruce timm to illustrate a fourth wall breaking story about harley thinking of the artists that could illustrate her in her own comic book series 73 74 the rest of the series details harley quinn s adventures in coney island with her supporting cast 75 in harley

palmiotti and conner replied yes they are girlfriends without the jealousy of monogamy 35 the new 52 harley quinn series received positive reception and was also one of dc comics top selling series inspiring multiple spin offs 75 72 the series was ended for the dc rebirth relaunch of dc s titles 78 controversies the cover of the first issue of the new 52 s suicide squad title drew controversy for its oversexualized depiction of harley quinn 13 this also caused some fans of the character to send glass hatemail and personal threats 62 in september 2013 dc comics announced an art contest entitled break into comics with harley quinn in which contestants were to draw harley in four different suicide scenarios this contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to national suicide prevention week but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of harley quinn in the fourth scenario in which the character attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub the american foundation for suicide prevention american psychiatric association and national alliance on mental illness all responded to the controversy in an emailed group statement to huffington post stating we are disappointed that dc comics has decided to host a contest looking for artists to develop ways to depict suicide attempts by one of its main villains harley quinn after seeing the reactions to the contest dc comics apologized saying they should have made it clear it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously in the final version the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with harley quinn sitting on a rocket while flying in space 79 80 81 dc rebirth in june 2016 the dc rebirth event relaunched dc comics entire line of comic book titles both

skills and often remains subordinate to the joker who between the two is the genius and the inventor harleen quinzel earned a bachelor s degree in psychology and as a former arkham psychiatrist was highly qualified in psychoanalysis criminology and forensic psychiatry while not on par with joker she is still an expert tactician deceiver and escapologist and still shows traces of her

interests harley quinn has had several love interests the most notable being joker and poison ivy other love interests include mason macabre a character created by conner and palmiotti 108 plastic man was initially intended to be a love interest for harley quinn by kesel but was not approved by dc 109 the joker so harley in her earlier incarnation really felt like she was the one for the joker that she could catch him and cure him and bring him back to humanity but actually in the process she lost hers before she knew it she had fallen head over heels in love with him i think initially he was looking to play her and get what he could out of her and then realized he had opened pandora s box and this woman in her madness could match him at just about anything he does i think he finds that in some ways very sexy and attractive but he s not really set up to love in the way a regular person is i think there are sparks and intensity and weird passion of a sort to their relationship but i would not call it a loving relationship in the traditional sense paul dini 2017 12 the joker is harley quinn s former lover harley s solo comics often explores her former association with the joker through flashbacks of their past exploits present day conflicts or through harley as she laments his absence 110 harley often refers to him as mistah j and puddin 111 their relationship is known for

purpose 113 dini describes their relationship as abusive 114 and empathizes with harley s feelings of abandonment with dini basing most of harley s dialogue on his past experiences 115 the joker s controlling and codependent relationship with harley quinn has been analyzed as a means of the joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or batman 116 joker mirrors his identity through harley in her appearance and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her he continues to try to subject her to his control 116

recovers the joker sends her flowers which she accepts reasserting his control over her 117 poison ivy harley quinn and poison ivy in new roots from batman urban legends 1 art by laura braga poison ivy is harley quinn s current love interest and best friend and harley often refers to her as red 118 ivy was first introduced as a new friend to harley by dini in the 1993 batman the animated series

strongest contrast to harley 119 the two later became close friends within the dc animated universe dini has stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kids cartoon at the time prevented it from happening 41 prior to the new 52 reboot ivy is shown as having teamed up on occasion with harley with harley being her best friend and recurring ally unlike most villain team ups their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect ivy sincerely wants to save harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the joker accordingly poison ivy despises the joker and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity in the final storyline of the gotham city sirens series harley suggests that ivy may be in love with her an accusation that stuns her 120 the following issue has poison ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love

several other superman related comic books in the early 1980s paul kupperberg who wrote ambush bug s first story recalled as keith was in the office he sat in on the plotting and offered up ambush bug as an antagonist the bug is entirely keith s creation 3 giffen has stated that both ambush bug and lobo were derived from lunatik a character he created in high school 4 giffen said that his original pitch was bugs bunny as a super villain 5 in response to positive reader reaction to the character s first appearance editor julius schwartz directed giffen to create another ambush bug story for dc comics presents 59 6 at first ambush bug was a villain named after a type of insect and dressed in a green skintight suit that covers his whole body with two orange antennae inside his hollow antennae he carries miniature robot bugs that possess the ability to teleport him around after attacking superman and other heroes ambush bug decides instead to be a superhero as well he also fancies himself superman s friend which only annoys the hero even more than his early villainy the costume then becomes permanently affixed to his body and he gains the power to teleport by himself while trying to fix one of the miniature bugs it explodes causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroys all of the bugs and tints ambush bug s costume temporarily black he then becomes capable of teleporting even without the bugs briefly considering changing his moniker to black beetle instead ambush bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials plotted and pencilled by keith giffen and scripted by robert loren fleming the series contains many comic book enthusiast and dc in jokes and satire series editor julius schwartz is also a character in the book 7 during his own 4 part series in 1985 he picks up a doll and thinking it is alive adopted it as a partner called cheeks the toy wonder complete with its own costume in 2001 he made his first appearance

troublemakers made a one panel cameo in a series exploring variations on the jla acronym jla justice league of amazons ambush bug is largely considered an absurd character and is rarely used by other writers though he still exists in the dc universe and occasionally still appears in some dc comics his popularity amongst creators has led to many cameos sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible in 2006 he appeared as part of firestorm s short lived justice league of america in 52 24 a comic giffen did layouts for his powers appeared in proxy in countdown to final crisis 32 jimmy

he was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located later after an explosion ambush bug internalized this power it became apparent in dc comics presents 81 that the bug used to have to say simon says to teleport but it is no longer necessary ambush bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers comic books he once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between firestorm s component personalities ambush bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the legion of substitute heroes with a single blow his unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents tactics and outmaneuver them humiliating them in the process despite all of this ambush bug is simply a skinny man in the costume and can be defeated with surprising ease by more ridiculous characters serious foes like batman or

hydrochloric acid to carbonise sugars which had been absorbed into the top layers of the stone 10 13 these techniques are still used as well as other dyeing treatments and most so called black onyx sold is artificially treated 14 in addition to dye treatments heating and treatment with nitric acid have been used to lighten or eliminate undesirable colours 10 geographic occurrence edit onyx is a

privilege even so as a youth he yearned to improve himself honing his body and mind to a sharp edge he studied the martial arts and eventually left for the east to learn from the masters anton learned of his father s death while travelling in the orient studying the martial arts at the funeral anton met his stepsister natalia also perhaps erroneously called natasha whom he had never met before and who had been raised in poverty the long separated stepsiblings fell in love and began a partnership natalia quickly became accustomed to the life of luxury anton had always known but the couple soon used up their inheritance in no small part because natalia needed expensive medical help due to a rare light sensitivity skin pigmentation disorder natalia and anton adopted a nocturnal existence to protect natalia from the damaging rays of the sun while continuing to use the expensive medical equipment to treat her skin sensitivity after the inheritance money began to run short anton and natalia decided to keep themselves in their accustomed lavish lifestyle through burglary following in their father s criminal footsteps clad in a black body suit anton used his martial arts and acrobatic prowess to rob gotham city s rich as the thief of night while natalia operated behind the scenes as nocturna mistress of the night 2 anton having spent much time in asia proved to be a highly capable martial artist however their burglary soon brought them into conflict with batman the two had several clashes with the darknight detective many of which ended with no clear cut victor for a while the night slayer even traded identities with a delirious batman after several clashes with batman anton was eventually captured and sent to prison nocturna remained free and continued her life of crime along with a new ally nightshade anton finally escaped and after being rejected by his beloved nocturna changed his style and became the murderous night slayer he killed nightshade an action which the more moral nocturna abhorred which is why she rejected him accusing anton of slaying the night after being betrayed too many times by nocturna anton vowed to kill her however that never occurred as he was again put in jail by the catwoman while nocturna seemingly died in an accident when last seen night slayer was freed from prison in a mass breakout engineered by ra s al ghul post crisis absence edit while his stepsister and former partner nocturna has returned to make various minor comics appearances over the years night slayer has been notably absent because of this it remains unclear if night slayer s existence is canonical in the post crisis universe powers and abilities edit night slayer is an expert martial artist in other media edit night slayer appears as an enemy in the nes

history edit ace the bat hound s first appearance in batman 92 july 1955 art by win mortimer and ira schnapp ace debuted in batman 92 july 1955 and was created by writer bill finger and artist sheldon moldoff 2 ace s introduction followed on krypto the superdog s debut in adventure comics 210 march 1955 3 and by german shepherd dogs from detective films and serials such as rin tin tin and ace the wonder dog ace along with batwoman batgirl and bat mite retired from the comic in 1964 when editor julius schwartz instituted a new look batman that shed some of the sillier elements in the series 4 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit ace was a german shepherd dog originally owned by an engraver named john wilker he was found by batman and robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters 5 batman used ace to try to locate wilker because he had already placed a large number of lost dog announcements for ace in his civilian identity of bruce wayne he was concerned that anyone recognizing ace who had a prominent star shaped marking on his forehead might make the connection between bruce wayne and batman to forestall that problem he hastily improvised a hood like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat emblem as a dog tag dangling from ace s collar 6 ace was subsequently christened the bat hound by a criminal that the dog helped batman to apprehend 7 wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of ace so he left the dog to bruce wayne 8 wilker was never aware that ace was the bat hound or that bruce wayne was batman an early case involved ace tracking down a mentally unhinged ancient weapons expert who was using his own weapons to commit crimes 9 at one point ace acquired superpowers thanks to bat mite but this was short lived 10 he did have his own training for example his specialized radio collar when activated told him to don his own mask via a hands free device and track down batman and robin 11 ace was used less and less over time and for various reasons when bruce was overcome with night terrors robin suggested that ace sleep beside him 12 ace disappeared from the batman comics after julius schwartz took over as editor in 1964 his last appearance was a cameo in a story where batman had lost his fighting spirit 13 post crisis edit batman 462 by alan grant and norm breyfogle a homicide leads batman to san francisco ruby valley and the first appearance of the post crisis ace a version of ace is seen in the cosmic realm of limbo when the hero animal man takes a trip through it 14 a post crisis version of ace was reintroduced in batman 462 june 1991 by the late alan grant and the late norm breyfogle although he has been rarely seen in recent years this version was originally a guide dog belonging to a blind native american named black wolf who called him dog the dog assisted batman in fighting criminals from black wolf s tribe following black wolf s death batman adopted dog renaming him ace he did not wear a mask nor was he ever referred to as bat hound and has the appearance of an english mastiff with a bat shaped dark patch on his flank ace has at times helped batman on cases 15 and is depicted to be very affectionate towards his owner and vice versa after batman is disabled by the villain bane azrael takes over the identity and ejects ace nightwing robin and harold allnut from the batcaves harold a trusted confidante of batman takes in ace they live in a part of the caverns that azrael is unfamiliar with 16 to keep busy ace enjoys playing with a robotic mouse built by harold 17 ace disappeared without explanation after the events of the no man s land storyline in the late 1990s he cameos in ambush bug year none a traditional ace was seen in final crisis superman beyond 3d he is in limbo with other forgotten characters such as gunfire geist hardhat of the demolition team and merryman of the inferior five merryman explains that everyone is here where no stories exist because nobody is writing about them despite this superman and his allies work to rescue all the residents of limbo who then assist in the battle against the cosmic threat of mandrakk 18 the original ace appeared in a flashback scene in batman inc 4 thus making the current canon status of the post crisis ace unclear in this story ace is trying to play with robin who is fuming over kathy kane a k a batwoman and her influence on batman 19 the new 52 edit in batman and robin vol 1 born to kill as part of the new 52 a 2011 reboot of the dc comics universe bruce is seen purchasing a black great dane from a kennel he later gives this dog to his son damian who names him titus damian rejects the dog at first but eventually bonds with him 20 writer peter tomasi revealed that he thought about naming damian s dog ace but it was best not to drop ace in at this point in the new 52 21 dc rebirth edit in dc rebirth a different ace was introduced in batman vol 3 annual 1 in which he is depicted as a former guard dog of the joker who fought batman until joker left him and the other dogs without food in a ditch to fight amongst themselves the dogs had card symbols on them and the brown dog with an ace on it killed the others he was sent to the gotham pound and alfred adopted him two days later in order to facilitate this alfred actually purchases the gotham pound turning it into the martha and thomas wayne humane society alfred spends the next couple of months training the dog despite bruce s objections as he thinks ace s wounds from the joker s actions cannot be healed despite this alfred manages to properly train him in time for christmas and bruce starts bonding with the dog after getting injured during one of his night shifts he gets ace a bat mask for christmas and calls him a bat hound though the gotham pound owner described ace as a female bruce and alfred have called ace a him leaving the gender ambiguous 22 ace is seen later playing with visitors he again obeys alfred without question 23 titus is seen as a pet living in wayne manor it alerts alfred of duke thomas s sneaking out 24 titus and ace are later shown sleeping in twin baskets confirming

and batman returns 1992 and the acclaimed superman theatrical cartoons produced by fleischer studios in the early 1940s 13 in designing the series bruce timm and eric radomski emulated the burton films otherworldly timelessness incorporating period features such as black and white title cards police airships and a vintage color scheme with film noir flourishes 14 the visual style of the series was based on the artwork of radomski and the gothic look of gotham city was derived from his initial designs 15 in addition radomski issued a standing order to the animation department that all backgrounds be painted using light colors on black paper as opposed to the industry standard of dark colors on white paper 14 the distinctive visual combination of noir imagery and art deco design was dubbed dark deco by the producers 16 the series initially took a variation of music written by danny elfman for the burton films as its theme later episodes of the series used a new theme with a similar style by shirley walker an occasional collaborator of elfman the score of the series was influenced by elfman s work on the burton films as well as music of 1940s film noir 17 the series is more adult oriented than many of the previous superhero cartoons while still being considered kid friendly appropriate for younger audiences it depicts outright physical violence against antagonists including realistic firearms though only one character commissioner gordon was ever depicted as having been shot in the episode i am the night first time producers timm and radomski reportedly encountered resistance from studio executives but the success of burton s first film allowed the embryonic series to survive long enough to produce a pilot episode on leather wings which according to timm got a lot of people off our backs 14 during the series production producer alan burnett wrote an episode without dialogue entitled silent night to explore more of batman s sexual life but this was never produced burnett also intended to make an episode featuring a female vampire that would bite batman to suck his blood but plans never materialized 18 the series is also notable for its supporting cast numerous known actors provided voices for a variety of recognizable villains most notable was mark hamill previously famous for his role as luke skywalker in the original star wars trilogy whose prominence as a voice actor was heightened through his cheerfully deranged portrayal of the joker 19 the role was originally given to tim curry but he developed bronchitis during the initial recording sessions 20 john glover who later voiced the riddler also auditioned for the joker role hamill who found himself to be the biggest fan of the batman comics among the cast credited the laughs he had honed on stage in amadeus with landing him the role 21 the recording sessions under the supervision of voice director andrea romano were recorded with the actors together in one studio instead of taking separate recordings as is typical this method would later be employed for all subsequent series in the dc animated universe al pacino was considered to voice two face in the series but he declined the offer 22 richard moll was instead cast in the role other actors included ron perlman as clayface roddy mcdowall as the mad hatter david warner as ra s al ghul michael york as count vertigo kate mulgrew as red claw george murdock as boss biggis ed asner as roland daggett and george dzundza as the ventriloquist one of the series best known inventions is the joker s assistant harley quinn who became so popular that dc comics later added her to mainstream comic book continuity the penguin underwent change for the series his appearance was remodeled after the version seen in batman returns which was in production simultaneously with the series first season new life was also given to lesser known characters for the series such as the clock king in addition dramatic changes were made to other villains such as clayface and mr freeze the latter of whom was changed from a gimmicky mad scientist to a tragic figure whose frigid exterior hid a doomed love and vindictive fury characters edit the joker s accomplice harley quinn gotham city police detective renee montoya the vigilante lock up former actor simon trent brainwashed comedian turned supervillain condiment king and ninja kyodai ken are original creations who became characters in the comics older villains that were lesser known from the comics such as count vertigo the mirror man and the clock king were modified for the series in both appearance and personality other original antagonists were created such as roland daggett red claw lloyd ventrix the sewer king boss biggis grant walker h a r d a c and emile dorian but to little acclaim and did not make any appearances outside the series though daggett was re imagined as businessman john daggett for the dark knight rises aside from creating characters that crossed over into the main line of dc comics several of the series reinterpretations were carried over as well mr freeze was revised in the comics to emulate the series tragic story the success of which actually compelled dc to bring the character back after killing him off some years earlier clayface was revised to be much more similar in appearance to his animated counterpart and two face s double sided black and white suit has become a common appearance for the character bruce wayne batman edit batman as seen in the original opening theme sequence of the series at the age of eight bruce wayne the son of billionaire philanthropists witnessed the murder of his parents thomas and martha during a mugging on the street the event left him traumatized and mentally scarred for the rest of his life this left bruce to be cared for by his family s butler alfred pennyworth over the years bruce slowly turned the pain and trauma he sustained into a burning fuel for a lifelong obsession as he underwent rigorous training in mental and physical conditioning the martial arts criminology sciences manhunting forensics detective work interrogation methods and intimidation for the next years of his life having observed the rampant crime and corruption across gotham city he chose to deal with the crime wave in gotham in his own way by using his years of training and swore an oath to dedicate his entire life to fighting crime in a bid to avenge the murder of his parents and to use his pain and suffering to drive him to do good while being guided by his self enforced moral code to never kill and to refrain from using firearms inspired by the presence of bats his childhood fear which used to be present around his home bruce chose to undertake the alias of the batman a feared near mythical and bat masked vigilante one of the most notable changes made in the animated series is the treatment of batman s alter ego bruce wayne in nearly all other media including the comics television shows and films bruce deliberately plays up his image as a vacuous self absorbed and not too bright billionaire playboy 23 in the animated series his character is assertive outwardly intelligent and actively involved in the management of wayne enterprises without jeopardizing his secret identity for example in the episode eternal youth bruce is shown angrily ordering one of his directors to cancel a deal with a timber company in the amazon rainforest that had been made behind his back threatening him with termination upon failure to comply kevin conroy used different voices to distinguish between his portrayal of bruce wayne and batman a tactic used previously by michael keaton in tim burton s live action films 24 conroy based his dual voice performance on the 1934 film adaptation of the scarlet pimpernel 21 dick grayson robin edit dick grayson s history in the show mirrors that in the comics the episode robin s reckoning reveals that grayson and his parents were acrobats in haly s circus following the tragic deaths of grayson s parents at the hands of mobster tony zucco bruce wayne adopts dick and eventually takes him on as a protégé the series also redefined the original robin dick grayson while much of dick s past remains the same his robin costume is modernized with short sleeves and long tights exactly like tim drake s original robin outfit but with a non italicized r symbol in addition dick is given a more serious and mature personality to match the tone of the series although he does have comedic moments occasionally the episode batgirl returns establishes that dick and barbara gordon attend the same college and that they are friends but neither one knows the secret identity of the other their relationship is one of the plot elements of the film batman mr freeze subzero his changing relationship with batman into a more tenser one is also highlighted in the show with the two parter episode robin s reckoning and the episode night of the ninja examining this this would eventually come to a head as depicted in the new batman adventures episode old wounds where dick abandons the robin persona in response to batman s growing coldness and leaves gotham barbara gordon batgirl edit barbara gordon is first seen in the two parter heart of steel where she becomes convinced that her father is an impostor she makes her first appearance as her alter ego batgirl in shadow of the bat after her father commissioner gordon is arrested under charges of corruption her batgirl costume is exactly the same from the adventures of batman and the bronze age of comics sporting the same gray bodysuit blue cape and cowl and yellow bat symbol and utility belt but with blue gloves and boots to mirror that of batman s costume instead of yellow ones except in the first part of shadow of the bat where she sported a black cape cowl gloves boots and undergarment similar to the ones in batman s costume she makes several appearances throughout the series and attends the same university as dick grayson though neither of them is aware of each other s crimefighting alter ego in batgirl returns barbara actually makes a cease fire deal with catwoman and they work together in solving the case of missing valuable cat statues while batman is away all of barbara s batgirl s appearances are in episodes written by brynne stephens the joker edit batman s rogues gallery from left to right mr freeze poison ivy the penguin the joker harley quinn the mad hatter the riddler catwoman with her cat isis and two face though the joker s origin is never shown in the series one of only two villains in the series who never got an origin episode the other one being the penguin some of his past is seen in the feature film batman mask of the phantasm in flashbacks he is shown before his accident but does not speak or is referred to by name his potential real name jack napier the same name of jack nicholson s version of the character from tim burton s 1989 film is established in the episodes dreams in darkness when it is spoken by dr bartholomew and in joker s wild where it is written in a dossier the use of this origin was due to the show being heavily patterned after the success and influential tone of tim burton s film however when the new batman adventures began during the era of joel schumacher s films joker s origin was retained but his identity was retconned as being merely one of many aliases as seen in the episode beware the creeper meaning his true identity is still unknown this reflected the efforts of the writers to put the character back in line with his conflicting multiple origins from the comics in mask of the phantasm the man who would become the joker started out as a chauffeur and hitman for mobsters salvatore valestra buzz bronski and chuckie sol on two occasions he saw bruce wayne and the two exchanged glances years before they would clash as the joker and batman later it is hinted in the rest of the series presumably after the valestra mob had gone their separate ways the man struck out on his own and formed a small gang the man broke into the ace chemical plant that marked the first time he encountered batman a fight which ended with him falling off a catwalk and into a drainage vat of chemicals he was washed out into the bay and discovered the chemicals bleached his skin chalk white dyed his hair green stained his lips red leaving them in a permanent rictus smile and dyed his suit purple this new clown like appearance snapped his already sadistic mind and drove him to eternal insanity he reinvented himself as the joker batman s greatest enemy and gotham city s most dangerous costumed criminal while the use of this origin was based on the jack nicholson version mark hamill was given the note don t do nicholson before his audition 25 during production hamill asked the production team consisting of timm radomski and romano if he could play one of the villains after a small appearance as ferris boyle in heart of ice even though tim curry had already recorded a few episodes hamill was given the part after curry developed bronchitis and departed the series hamill who found himself to be the biggest fan of the batman comics among the cast credited the laughs he had honed on stage in amadeus with landing him the role 21 he worked to craft a multifaceted laugh for the joker that could change to reflect the joker s current mood likening it to a musical instrument 26 when recording his lines with the other actors hamill would stand while the other actors would remain seated to invest himself in the role hamill s take on the joker s laugh and the role in general is considered to be groundbreaking for the voice acting industry and led to hamill having an enormously successful voice acting career 26 of the many influences for his performance including jay leno and howard cosell hamill cited claude rains performance in the 1933 film the invisible man 27 28 other characters edit other antagonists that appeared in the series included classic villains such as poison ivy catwoman the riddler two face the mad hatter

rogers during a spotlight podcast from comic con 2007 paul dini explained that the reason why the episode combined those stories was that the show s creators could not adapt them separately because their content and thematic elements would not have been cleared by the censors the strange secret of bruce wayne was based on the comic stories the dead yet live and i am the batman from detective comics 471 472 august september 1977 by steve englehart moon of the wolf is based on the comic story of the same name by writer len wein with art by neal adams from batman no 255 april 1974 the episode terror in the sky is loosely based on man bat over vegas originally presented in detective comics no 429 by writer and artist frank robbins the setting has been shifted from las vegas to gotham harbor and in keeping with the family friendly rating of the television show the she bat is not a vampire in the adaptation the final line of the episode the nightmare s finally over is similar to one of the final lines from the original comic now fran s vampire nightmare is about over the episode almost got im appears to be influenced by a four issue story arc in batman 291 294 1977 entitled where were you on the night batman was killed all four stories were written by david vern reed and drawn by john calnan under the direction of batman editor julius schwartz in each of the four issues one of catwoman the riddler and the joker all recount their claims to have killed batman however the plot for almost got im is quite different six stories in the show and four completely different ones in the comic book with only the joker as an overlapping antagonist two face s strategy in almost got im strapping down batman to a giant coin and flipping the coin in the air was taken from the comic world s finest comics no 30 september 1947 by writer bill finger and artist bob kane in a backup tale both batman and robin were tied to a giant penny that was catapulted onto spikes by a lesser known villain the penny plunderer off balance is a direct adaptation of batman into the den of the death dealers from detective comics 411 may 1971 written by writer dennis o neil and drawn by artists bob brown and dick giordano famous for the first appearance of the mysterious character talia the two part episode the demon s quest is a direct adaptation of daughter of the demon from batman no 232 june 1971 and the demon lives again batman no 244 september 1972 written by dennis o neil and drawn by artist neal adams famous for introducing one of batman s deadlier foes ra s al ghul the father of talia the episode sideshow is loosely based on a vow from the grave from detective comics no 410 by writer dennis o neil and artists bob brown and dick giordano this episode adapted the comic book story with the inclusion of a separate killer croc story a bullet for bullock is based on the comic of the same name from detective comics no 651 october 1992 by writer chuck dixon and artist graham nolan the feature film mask of the phantasm is also an adaptation the film s flashbacks were inspired by batman year one whereas the character of andrea beaumont and the storyline itself were modified from mike barr s story batman year two which ran in detective comics 575 578 in the late 1980s the villain in the comics was named the reaper 32 in other media edit sixteen minutes of animated segments in the video game the adventures of batman robin for the sega cd are sometimes referred to as a lost episode of the series these segments are intended to be interspersed between gameplay elements of an early 1990s video game and as such the sound color and story are not quite of the same quality of the actual television program and because sega did not have to follow the censorship rules of the show the fights are also a little more violent many of the shows voice actors reprised their roles for the game and are thus in the lost episode as well similar cutscenes appear throughout the video games batman vengeance and batman rise of sin tzu 33 feature films edit batman mask of the phantasm 1993 based on the animated series the film started production as a direct to video release but was ultimately changed into a theatrical release 34 although the film was not a financial success upon its initial release it earned widespread acclaim and has since become a commercial success through its various home media releases 35 batman mr freeze subzero 1998 a direct to video release which was produced as a tie in to the 1997 film batman robin subzero s release was delayed until the following year due to batman robin failing to meet commercial and critical expectations 36 comic adaptation and novelization edit the batman adventures edit main article the batman adventures the animated series was accompanied by a tie in comic book the batman adventures which followed the art style and continuity of the animated series instead of other batman comic books the batman adventures through several format changes to reflect the changing world of the series and its spin offs outlasted the series itself by nearly a decade finally being cancelled in 2004 to make way for the tie in comic of the then new unrelated batman animated series the batman the character of harley quinn s first official comic appearance occurred in issue no 12 of the series it has become highly sought after by collectors and fans of the character superman batman magazine edit it is a tie in for batman the animated series and the batman adventures with 8 issues published between 1993 and 1995 the stories feature the appearances of superman and other dc characters before their appearances in the base series and spinoff television series but otherwise unrelated to the stories in the subsequent television series batman the adventures continue edit main article batman the adventures continue dc announced in february 2020 that paul dini alan burnett and artist ty templeton would be leading a new miniseries batman the adventures continue to be first published in april 2020 based on the animated series and following shortly after its conclusion with tim drake still adjusting as the new robin to batman 37 novels edit there was also a short lived series of tie in novels adapted from episodes of the series by science fiction author geary gravel to achieve

followed by the live action sitcom shaky ground however the tv ratings fell short as the show aired opposite the perennial favorite 60 minutes and the series was removed from this time slot in march 1993 after the series produced its 65th episode the minimum number necessary for a tv series to be successfully syndicated fox network executives ordered a second season of 20 more episodes that was later reduced to airing weekly on saturday mornings the second season featured robin more prominently and as a result was retitled the adventures of batman robin in the title credits 38 this run of episodes had two new opening sequences and ending credits in total the series reached 85 episodes before finishing its original run on september 15 1995 in 1997 following the end of fox kids five year

edit batman the animated series has been consistently ranked as one of the greatest animated television shows ever made 41 42 43 it has been critically acclaimed for its sophistication mature tone complex story voice acting orchestrated soundtrack artistic ambition and faithfulness to the source material 3 44 in 1992 entertainment weekly ranked the series as one of the top television series of the year 45 in his reference book batman the complete history les daniels described the animated series as coming as close as any artistic statement has to defining the look of batman for the 1990s 46 animation historian charles solomon gave the series a somewhat mixed assessment commenting that the dark art deco influenced backgrounds tended to eclipse the stiff animation and pedestrian storytelling and concluding that the series looked better in stills than it did on the screen 47 ign listed the animated series as the best adaptation of batman anywhere outside of comics 48 the best comic book cartoon of all time 3 and the second best animated series of all time after the simpsons 41 wizard magazine also ranked it no 2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time again after the simpsons 49 tv guide ranked batman the animated series the seventh greatest cartoon of all time out of 60 50 influence edit due to the success of batman the animated series many crew members went on to design and produce superman the animated series for the wb network during this time they created the new batman adventures which featured the same streamlined animation style as superman the animated series as well as numerous character re designs from the original series despite taking place in the same continuity 51 in 1999 a futuristic spin off series titled batman beyond premiered on the wb featuring a teenager named terry mcginnis taking on the duties of batman under the guidance of an elderly bruce wayne 11 then in 2001 the justice league animated series premiered on cartoon network featuring batman as one of the founding members of the league this was continued in 2004 by justice league unlimited featuring a greatly expanded league many dc cartoons unrelated to the larger dc animated universe such as teen titans and the batman also featured character designs strongly influenced by those of bruce timm the dramatic writing and stylized art of batman the animated series separates it from many traditional comic book based cartoons it can be considered the dramatic equivalent of more adult oriented cartoon shows like the simpsons for this reason the show s popularity along with that of its various spin offs endures among older audiences and comic book fans the lego minifigures of various batman characters are more strongly based on the designs from batman the animated series than any other form of batman media 52 more precisely the joker two face poison ivy mr freeze and harley quinn s minifigures seem to have identical costumes and faces to the characters from the series the dark atmosphere mature themes and even some of the voice cast from the series are employed in the batman arkham video game series 53 kevin conroy mark hamill arleen sorkin robert costanzo reprising their roles while actors like adrienne barbeau and loren lester lent their voice to other characters furthermore the first two games are co written by series veteran

pre orders at gamestop and a valid membership to power up rewards 54 there are also animated inspired alternate skins for catwoman nightwing and robin actor robert pattinson who portrays batman in the batman 2022 has cited batman mask of the phantasm as an example of batman media that effectively captured the character s psyche in a fashion he hoped his interpretation would emulate 55 accolades

september 2018 in high definition 224 it moved to hbo max on january 1 2021 225 226 video games edit several video games based on the animated continuity were released during the 16 bit game machine era using the adventures of batman robin second season branding konami developed a game for the super nintendo entertainment system snes while sega released versions of the game for the sega genesis mega drive mega cd and game gear the snes genesis mega drive and game gear versions were side scrolling action games while the mega cd version featured a 3 d driving adventure all of the games had art true to the series while sega s versions featured art elements directly from the show s creators 227 the cd version has over 20 minutes of original animated footage comparable to the most well crafted episodes 228 with the principal voice actors reprising their roles there was also a game made for the game boy based on the series and created around the same time developed and published by konami this game was distinctive upon the fact that it still used the earlier batman the animated series moniker instead of the adventures of batman robin second season title given to the other games though not directly related the batman arkham video game series features some of the voice cast from the animated series returning to their roles including kevin conroy as batman and mark hamill as the joker along with arleen sorkin as harley quinn in batman arkham asylum and robert costanzo as harvey bullock in batman arkham origins while actors like loren lester lent their voice to other characters additionally the first two games were written by animated series writer paul dini many of the characters costumes from the series also appear as downloadable skins in the games in lego dc super villains a downloadable content level was released based on the batman mask of the phantasm film and contained some characters from the show including the batman the animated series version of batman the joker harley quinn two face andrea beaumont as the phantasm mad hatter man bat and captain clown cancelled spin off edit due to the success of the show fox approached bruce timm to make a spin off centered on catwoman but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter 229 see also edit gotham girls list of the new batman adventures episodes aired from september 13 1997 references edit erickson

potential allies seeking a second chance bring them together to defend the allytown eventually they have success and begin to repair the damage characterization edit powers and abilities edit killer croc s backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling epidermolytic hyperkeratosis a disfiguring skin disorder however it is actually a form of regressive atavism meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race such as reptiles this condition has been augmented by the presence of a metagene consequently he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance speed and strength making him able to lift up to two tons his skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of abrasion including high caliber weapons fired from a distance he also possesses an extraordinary amount of super strength for example he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort he has demonstrated regenerative powers allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth he possesses superhuman reflexes and speed especially while he is moving underwater he can also see through his crocodile eyelids killer croc also has an enhanced sense of smell once he has become familiar with a person s scent he can track them from miles away as his appearance and personality has grown more and more bestial his misanthropy has increased dramatically he is jealous and hateful of normal people and often lashes out violently without provocation as a result of these feelings of jealousy croc will often entertain himself by grabbing hold of small pointy objects as a source of comfort croc s main weakness is consistently portrayed in most adaptations aside from the batman series as being his low intellect he typically resorts to brute force to solve most problems allowing batman to outmaneuver him in combat by thinking his way through the problems he faces in defeating the powerful croc batman regularly describes his foe as an animal rather than a man he acts almost solely on instinct and hardly ever takes the time to plan or rationalize his actions this is a departure from his initial portrayal where he was shown to be a ruthless and intelligent criminal who was able to plot his ascent from henchman to the squid to perhaps the most powerful force in gotham organized crime before being defeated by the batman appearance edit in recent years killer croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations an action figure made by kenner in 1998 featured a tail and dinosaur like feet when mattel got the license to make dc products in the early 2000s they released their own version of killer croc sculpted by four horsemen studios this version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet in late 2005 a re release of this figure was modified so that the tail along with his shirt was removed this version also sports a more human head the 2002 2003 batman storyline hush featured a more bestial croc who had been mutated against his will to appear more reptilian this version of the character was drawn by artist jim lee in the new 52 he is shown to have a crocodile like head though how this came to be has not yet been revealed such a design had previously appeared in red hood and the outlaws drawn by kenneth rocafort alternative versions edit a number of alternate universes in dc comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on killer croc in which the character s origins behavior and morality differ from the mainstream setting in the non canon graphic novel joker written by brian azzarello and artist lee bermejo croc is portrayed as a large muscular black man with sharp teeth and a scaly skin condition of all his previous designs this is the most human without a snout tail or claws the book hints that croc enjoys feeding on human flesh with the story s narrator jonny frost remarking that croc has a certain eccentric way with evidence croc is shown leading a gang of thugs and later becomes a high level member of joker s newly formed gang this vision of the character is not unlike the one from azzarello s previous work on batman broken city 19 in the batman beyond comic killer croc is mentioned as being a prisoner in a cadmus labs facility his cell is briefly attacked by the new hush a clone of dick grayson

for collateral damage 20 in the crossover batman aliens 2 killer croc is part of an experiment by the twisted black ops officer doctor fortune to create hybrid soldiers using dna from the xenomorphs and the dna of some of batman s villains hoping to harness the villains genetic traits for survival without their psychological trauma however her use of croc proves to be her undoing as batman notes that croc turned to villainy because he was naturally ruthless rather than being subject to any sort of trauma resulting in the croc xenomorph hybrid tearing fortune s head off before batman manages to drown it after destroying her offshore base in batman crimson mist killer croc begins as a rumored serial killer stalking gotham s sewers later joining two face s gang as the muscle faced with the

is able to help his old master recover by sacrificing his life and blood to give batman the strength to stop gotham s last criminals with alfred s sacrifice batman impales croc with a stalactite

matches s dead body in another fire apparently a suicide batman never reported his death at the time he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help gather information but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of prompting batman to adopt the man s identity as his own years later batman learned the truth about what had happened carver s death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched with matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother s suicide subsequently deciding to escape batman stalking him for the crime

operating underground for years by committing low end robberies matches returned to gotham after hearing reports of his activities only to be shot by scarface for his recent betrayal surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to batman and nightwing before dying with his last request being that batman bury him next to his brother having destroyed scarface in revenge for matches s death batman commented to nightwing later on that the former continued using the identity because of having come to recognize that matches was not an evil man but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for regarding his use of his name as a chance to give matches some absolution the matches malone identity indirectly caused the events of batman war games stephanie brown after being fired as robin attempted to implement an old plan of batman s that would allow the latter to take control of the city s criminal organizations hoping that this would impress batman

martinbrough created the character in detective comics 742 march 2000 allen later went on to be one of the main characters in gotham central after he was killed by a corrupt police technician named jim corrigan who has no connection with the jim corrigan who was a host of the spectre allen became the third host for the spectre fictional character biography edit gcpd mcu edit originally from metropolis detective crispus allen was a fortysomething police veteran transferred to gotham city where he was partnered with detective renee montoya on the gotham city police department s major crimes unit allen had a loving wife and two teenaged sons whom he put above his job and the safety of others when gotham was in crisis allen saw batman as a necessary evil not wanting to deal with him but tolerating his presence their occasional interactions illustrated his views on batman notably during brian azzarello s broken city storyline allen was an agnostic who doubted the existence of god in spite of his family s strong faith jim corrigan edit one night allen and his partner renee montoya spotted gang members apparently preparing for some sort of violent action allen requested backup but the two opted not to wait for the backup to arrive following the gang into a deserted building the detectives found several murdered men as well as two large gang members allen tailed the suspects while montoya scouted the rest of the building the black spider suddenly appeared at the crime scene firing upon montoya the first few shots hit montoya but she was protected by her bulletproof vest black spider then aimed at her head but allen shot and killed the villain before he could pull the trigger the internal affairs department subsequently questioned allen regarding the incident confiscated his gun and put him on temporary leave until his story could be corroborated complications arose when a crime scene technician named jim corrigan stole important evidence a bullet of black spider s that struck a rival gang member from the scene putting allen s career in jeopardy the internal affairs investigator in charge of allen s case told montoya about the missing bullet and suggested corrigan s connection to its disappearance montoya found corrigan and forced him to reveal the location of the bullet after it was recovered allen was allowed to return to active duty however montoya s actions destroyed an ongoing internal affairs investigation into corrigan s misconduct this left allen angry and disappointed in her because he had secretly started his own investigation of corrigan which montoya s actions also compromised allen continued his investigation which took place during the events of infinite crisis but corrigan was tipped off corrigan found allen s informant and beat him to death corrigan let allen find the informant s body before shooting allen in the back and killing him in gotham central 38 by tampering with the evidence at the crime scene corrigan managed to evade prosecution allen s unavenged death pushed montoya to an emotional breakdown and she subsequently decided to quit the force in disgust at the system the spectre edit main article spectre dc comics character crispus allen as the spectre from a panel from tales of the unexpected 1 december 2006 art by eric battle while allen s body is in the morgue the presence forces the spectre to accept allen as his new host 1 later the magic users of earth assemble at stonehenge to call forth the spectre and usher in the new age of magic allen appears in a ghostly version of his own form before making his first official transformation into the spectre the spectre then kills star sapphire and two others for their past crimes before vanishing leaving the assembled magic users confused and fearful in the first issue of infinite crisis aftermath the spectre dead again part one the spectre confronts crispus allen he has come to realize that he needs a host to humanize him in order to know what his mission really means allen refuses his request wanting no further involvement in the spectre s vigilante work the spectre then leaves allen for a year presumably about the same as the year depicted in 52 during that time allen sees that he cannot help or communicate with his family still shattered because jim corrigan will not be called to account for allen s murder in addition while the former detective can solve crimes and even learns batman s secret identity is bruce wayne he cannot bring the culprits to justice 2 this includes corrigan his own killer after a year of being unseen and powerless allen receives another visit from the spectre this time he finally takes the offer and becomes the spectre s human host their first mission together is to bring ghoulishly appropriate justice to a child molester while troubled allen is satisfied by the knowledge that he the spectre needs me more than i need him 2 allen works with the spectre for a while choosing whom to visit punishment upon the spectre informs allen there is one more punishment to be enacted before the two can fully bond allen sees his killer stumbling out of a bar and revels in the chance to gain revenge malcolm allen his son appears and despite crispus attempts kills corrigan crispus then passes judgement on his own son who dies peacefully in his arms he thinks this means his son is doomed to hell but the spectre explains they just judge not condemn crispus then chooses to fully bond with the spectre 3 in countdown to mystery allen and the spectre accompanied by the spirit of a criminal they killed set out to foil eclipso s plans to corrupt superheroes during the climactic battle between spectre and eclipso allen realizes that if the spectre kills his opponent it will result in him going down a path of destruction allen appeals to bruce gordon who is able to take control of eclipso final crisis edit main article final crisis the spectre is one of the main characters in the miniseries final crisis revelations the spectre crispus first took vengeance upon doctor light for all of his crimes against humanity then was sent to enact vengeance on libra for the death of the martian manhunter libra was somehow unaffected by the spectre s powers and nearly killed him but the spectre used his powers to escape afterward allen swore that he would no longer do as god said attempting to revoke his status as the spectre but was instead called by god to enact vengeance on his former partner renee montoya for her sins 4 he was stopped in his judgment by radiant the spirit of mercy another loyal servant of the presence tasked with granting god s mercy to repentant beings or those forced to act against their pure intentions the radiant admonished crispus allen about using his powers in a more responsible way changing the world as the former host of the spectre did instead of enacting retribution over one soul at time radiant s forgiveness caused allen to suffer a crisis of faith demanding to know why renee was forgiven whereas allen was forced to kill his own son meanwhile in a world corrupted by darkseid and the anti life equation the cult of the stone a religious sect devoted to the adoration of cain used the spear of destiny carelessly misplaced by allen himself while judging montoya to resurrect cain in the body of vandal savage cain agreed to lead his forces against the spectre in retaliation for his curse 5 using the spear of destiny cain stabbed the spectre and separated him from allen effectively killing the human host 6 the spectre was placed under cain s control and allen s spirit departed the scene and visited his son s grave when montoya managed to take the spear from cain and purify it freeing the spectre allen willingly returned to his role as its human host after montoya used the spear to revive his son united they defeated cain and the cult of crime allen thanked montoya for her assistance before the presence called him and the radiant on to their next mission 7 the spectre and the radiant are later seen in the final issue of final crisis having been defeated by mandrakk the dark monitor 8 a short time later crispus assists the immortal adventurer known as xombi in tracking down the vengeful spirit of a serial killer who is murdering vampires and other supernatural creatures 9 blackest night edit main article blackest night black hand reveals that the spectre must be moved out of the way in order for the universe to be at peace he sends several black rings to latch onto crispus body transforming him into a black lantern and sealing the spectre within him 10 on coast city hal jordan encounters the black lantern spectre using the real spectre s power to protect itself it is rendered immune to the combination of emotional lights that usually destroy black lanterns hal allows himself to be possessed by parallax once more in order to stop him 11 parallax tears into the black lantern s body freeing the real spectre and destroying the facsimile parallax then attempts to destroy the spectre who uses his own power coupled with the love carol ferris feels for hal to separate parallax from its host 12 other versions edit batman year 100 edit in the alternate future limited series batman year 100 there is a scene where james gordon the son of barbara gordon and the grandson of his namesake is going through his grandfather s belongings he briefly finds a photograph of crispus from 2006 and remarks that he looks so young in other media edit television edit andrew stewart jones portrays crispus allen in the fox tv series gotham he appears as a detective at gotham city police department where he works in the major crimes unit and is partnered with renee montoya he and montoya initially accuse gordon for cobblepot s murder until the latter shows alive crispus later occasionally assists gordon in fighting gotham s corruption after he and renee save jim from the hitman victor zsasz becoming gordon s allies 13 allen and montoya didn t return for the show s following seasons 14 film edit gary dourdan voices detective crispus allen

originally despised batman s vigilantism however after the dark knight saved him and his partner from a gang war between sal maroni and the russian mob allen begins to see that batman s presence is necessary in gotham even though he still does not approve of vigilantes in segment six allen is seen acting as the go between for batman and gordon as word has been received that gordon has been targeted for assassination so allen must inform batman of the deadshot threat crispus allen is also present in the dc extended universe played by kobna holdbrook smith in justice league allen

amygdalē almond tonsil 1 is one of two almond shaped clusters of nuclei located deep and medially within the temporal lobes of the brain s cerebrum in complex vertebrates including humans 2 shown to perform a primary role in the processing of memory decision making and emotional responses including fear anxiety and aggression the amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system 3 the term

6 anxiety 4 7 posttraumatic stress disorder 4 8 bipolar disorder 5 additional images 6 see also 7 references 8 further reading 9 external links structure edit mri coronal view of the right amygdala subdivisions of the mouse amygdala the regions described as amygdala nuclei encompass several structures of the cerebrum with distinct connectional and functional characteristics in humans and other animals 5 among these nuclei are the basolateral complex the cortical nucleus the medial nucleus the central nucleus and the intercalated cell clusters the basolateral complex can be further subdivided into the lateral the basal and the accessory basal nuclei 3 6 7 anatomically the amygdala 8 and more particularly its central and medial nuclei 9 have sometimes been classified as a part of the basal ganglia hemispheric specializations edit in one study electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions especially fear and sadness in contrast stimulation of the left amygdala was able to induce either pleasant happiness or unpleasant fear anxiety sadness emotions 10 other evidence suggests that the left amygdala plays a role in the brain s reward system 11 each side holds a specific function in how we perceive and process emotion the right and left portions of the amygdala have independent memory systems but work together to store encode and interpret emotion the right hemisphere of the amygdala is associated with negative emotion 12 13 it plays a role in the expression of fear and in the processing of fear inducing stimuli fear conditioning which occurs when a neutral stimulus acquires aversive properties occurs within the right hemisphere when an individual is presented with a conditioned aversive stimulus it is processed within the right amygdala producing an unpleasant or fearful response this emotional response conditions the individual to avoid fear inducing stimuli and more importantly to assess threats in the environment the right hemisphere is also linked to declarative memory which consists of facts and information from previously experienced events and must be consciously recalled it also plays a significant role in the retention of episodic memory episodic memory consists of the autobiographical aspects of memory permitting recall of emotional and sensory experience of an event this type of memory does not require conscious recall the right amygdala plays a role in the association of time and places with emotional properties 14 development and sex distinction edit see also neuroscience of sex differences the amygdala is one of the best understood brain regions with regard to differences between the sexes the amygdala is larger in males than females in children aged 7 to 11 15 adult humans 16 and adult rats 17 there is considerable growth within the first few years of structural development in both male and female amygdalae 18 within this early period female limbic structures grow at a more rapid pace than the male ones amongst female subjects the amygdala reaches its full growth potential approximately 1 5 years before the peak of male development the structural development of the male amygdala occurs over a longer period than in women despite the early development of female amygdalae they reach their growth potential sooner than males whose amygdalae continue to develop the larger relative size of the male amygdala may be attributed to this extended developmental period hormonal factors may contribute to these sex specific developmental differences the amygdala is rich in androgen receptors nuclear receptors that bind to testosterone androgen receptors play a role in the dna binding that regulates gene expression though testosterone is present within the female hormonal systems women have lower levels of testosterone than men the abundance of testosterone in the male hormonal system may contribute to development in addition the grey matter volume on the amygdala is predicted by testosterone levels which may also contribute to the increased mass of the male amygdala there are observable developmental differences between the right and left amygdala the left amygdala reaches its developmental peak approximately 1 5 2 years prior to the right amygdala despite the early growth of the left amygdala the right increases in volume for a longer period of time the right amygdala is associated with response to fearful stimuli as well as face recognition it is inferred that the early development of the left amygdala functions to provide infants the ability to detect danger 18 in childhood the amygdala is found to react differently to same sex versus opposite sex individuals this reactivity decreases until a person enters adolescence where it increases dramatically at puberty 19 other functional and structural differences between male and female amygdalae have been observed subjects amygdala activation was observed when watching a horror film and subliminal stimuli the results of the study showed a different lateralization of the amygdala in men and women enhanced memory for the film was related to enhanced activity of the left but not the right amygdala in women whereas it was related to enhanced activity of the right but not the left amygdala in men 20 similarly a study of decision making ability in patients with unilateral amygdala damage suggested that men with right but not left amygdala damage were more likely to be impaired in decision making ability while women with left but not right amygdala damage were more likely to be impaired in decision making ability 21 22 one study found evidence that on average women tend to retain stronger memories for emotional events than men 23 function edit connections edit a simple view of the information processing through the amygdala follows as the amygdala sends projections to the hypothalamus the dorsomedial thalamus the thalamic reticular nucleus the nuclei of the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve the ventral tegmental area the locus coeruleus and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus 6 the basolateral amygdala projects to the nucleus accumbens including the medial shell 24 25 coronal section of brain through intermediate mass of third ventricle amygdala is shown in purple the medial nucleus is involved in the sense of smell and pheromone processing it receives input from the olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex 26 the lateral amygdalae which send impulses to the rest of the basolateral complexes and to the centromedial nuclei receive input from the sensory systems the centromedial nuclei are the main outputs for the basolateral complexes and are involved in emotional arousal in rats and cats 6 7 27 variability in amygdala connectivity has been related to a variety of behaviors and outcomes such as fear recognition 28 and social network size 29 emotional learning edit main article emotion and memory in complex vertebrates including humans the amygdalae perform primary roles in the formation and storage of memories associated with emotional events research indicates that during fear conditioning sensory stimuli reach the basolateral complexes of the amygdalae particularly the lateral nuclei where they form associations with memories of the stimuli the association between stimuli and the aversive events they predict may be mediated by long term potentiation 30 31 a sustained enhancement of signaling between affected neurons 32 there have been studies that show that damage to the amygdala can interfere with memory that is strengthened by emotion one study examined a patient with bilateral degeneration of the amygdala he was told a violent story accompanied by matching pictures and was observed based on how much he could recall from the story the patient had less recollection of the story than patients with functional amygdala showing that the amygdala has a strong connection with emotional learning 33 emotional memories are thought to be stored in synapses throughout the brain fear memories for example are considered to be stored in the neuronal connections from the lateral nuclei to the central nucleus of the amygdalae and the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis part of the extended amygdala these connections are not the sole site of fear memories given that the nuclei of the amygdala receive and send information to other brain regions that are important for memory such as the hippocampus some sensory neurons project their axon terminals to the central nucleus 34 the central nuclei are involved in the genesis of many fear responses such as defensive behavior freezing or escape responses autonomic nervous system responses changes in blood pressure and heart rate tachycardia neuroendocrine responses stress hormone release etc damage to the amygdalae impairs both the acquisition and expression of pavlovian fear conditioning a form of classical conditioning of emotional responses 32 accumulating evidence has suggested that multiple neuromodulators acting in the amygdala regulates the formation of emotional memories 35 36 37 the amygdalae are also involved in appetitive positive conditioning it seems that distinct neurons respond to positive and negative stimuli but there is no clustering of these distinct neurons into clear anatomical nuclei 38 39 however lesions of the central nucleus in the amygdala have been shown to reduce appetitive learning in rats lesions of the basolateral regions do not exhibit the same effect 40 research like this indicates that different nuclei within the amygdala have different functions in appetitive conditioning 41 42 nevertheless researchers found an example of appetitive emotional learning showing an important role for the basolateral amygdala the naïve female mice are innately attracted to non volatile pheromones contained in male soiled bedding but not by the male derived volatiles become attractive if associated with non volatile attractive pheromones which act as unconditioned stimulus in a case of pavlovian associative learning 43 in the vomeronasal olfactory and emotional systems fos gene family proteins show that non volatile pheromones stimulate the vomeronasal system whereas air borne volatiles activate only the olfactory system thus the acquired preference for male derived volatiles reveals an olfactory vomeronasal associative learning moreover the reward system is differentially activated by the primary pheromones and secondarily attractive odorants exploring the primary attractive pheromone activates the basolateral amygdala and the shell of nucleus accumbens but neither the ventral tegmental area nor the orbitofrontal cortex in contrast exploring the secondarily attractive male derived odorants involves activation of a circuit that includes the basolateral amygdala prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area therefore the basolateral amygdala stands out as the key center for vomeronasal olfactory associative learning 44 social edit reward edit glutamatergic neurons in the basolateral amygdala send projections to the nucleus accumbens shell and core activation of these projections drive motivational salience the ability of these projections to drive incentive salience is dependent upon dopamine receptor d1 24 25 memory modulation edit the amygdala is also involved in the modulation of memory consolidation following any learning event the long term memory for the event is not formed instantaneously rather information regarding the event is slowly assimilated into long term potentially lifelong storage over time possibly via long term potentiation recent studies suggest that the amygdala regulates memory consolidation in other brain regions also fear conditioning a type of memory that is impaired following amygdala damage is mediated in part by long term potentiation 30 31 during the consolidation period the memory can be modulated in particular it appears that emotional arousal following the learning event influences the strength of the subsequent memory for that event greater emotional arousal following a learning event enhances a person s retention of that event experiments have shown that administration of stress hormones to mice immediately after they learn something enhances their retention when they are tested two days later 45 the amygdala especially the basolateral nuclei are involved in mediating the effects of emotional arousal on the strength of the memory for the event as shown by many laboratories including that of james mcgaugh these laboratories have trained animals on a variety of learning tasks and found that drugs injected into the amygdala after training affect the animals subsequent retention of the task these tasks include basic classical conditioning tasks such as inhibitory avoidance where a rat learns to associate a mild footshock with a particular compartment of an apparatus and more complex tasks such as spatial or cued water maze where a rat learns to swim to a platform to escape the water if a drug that activates the amygdalae is injected into the amygdalae the animals had better memory for the training in the task 46 if a drug that inactivates the amygdalae is injected the animals had impaired memory for the task in rats dna damage was found to increase in the amygdala immediately after exposure to stress 47 stress was induced by 30 minutes of restraint or by forced swimming by seven days after exposure to these stresses increased dna damage was no longer detectable in the amygdala probably because of dna repair 47 buddhist monks who do compassion meditation have been shown to modulate their amygdala along with their temporoparietal junction and insula during their practice 48 in an fmri study more intensive insula activity was found in expert meditators than in novices 49 amygdala activity at the time of encoding information correlates with retention for that information however this correlation depends on the relative emotionalness of the information more emotionally arousing information increases amygdalar activity and that activity correlates with retention amygdala neurons show various types of oscillation during emotional arousal such as theta activity these synchronized neuronal events could promote synaptic plasticity which is involved in memory retention by increasing interactions between neocortical storage sites and temporal lobe structures involved in declarative memory 50 rorschach test blot 03 research using rorschach test blot 03 finds that the number of unique responses to this random figure links to larger sized amygdalae the researchers note since previous reports have indicated that unique responses were observed at higher frequency in the artistic population than in the nonartistic normal population this positive correlation suggests that amygdalar enlargement in the normal population might be related to creative mental activity 51 neuropsychological correlates of amygdala activity edit early research on primates provided explanations as to the functions of the amygdala as well as a basis for further research as early as 1888 rhesus monkeys with a lesioned temporal cortex including the amygdala were observed to have significant social and emotional deficits 52 heinrich klüver and paul bucy later expanded upon this same observation by showing that large lesions to the anterior temporal lobe produced noticeable changes including overreaction to all objects hypoemotionality loss of fear hypersexuality and hyperorality a condition in which inappropriate objects are placed in the mouth some monkeys also displayed an inability to recognize familiar objects and would approach animate and inanimate objects indiscriminately exhibiting a loss of fear towards the experimenters this behavioral disorder was later named klüver bucy syndrome accordingly 53 and later research proved it was specifically due to amygdala lesions monkey mothers who had amygdala damage showed a reduction in maternal behaviors towards their infants often physically abusing or neglecting them 54 in 1981 researchers found that selective radio frequency lesions of the whole amygdala caused klüver bucy syndrome 55 with advances in neuroimaging technology such as mri neuroscientists have made significant findings concerning the amygdala in the human brain a variety of data shows the amygdala has a substantial role in mental states and is related to many psychological disorders some studies have shown children with anxiety disorders tend to have a smaller left amygdala in the majority of the cases there was an association between an increase in the size of the left amygdala with the use of ssris antidepressant medication or psychotherapy the left amygdala has been linked to social anxiety disorder obsessive and compulsive disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder as well as more broadly to separation and generalized anxiety disorder 56 in a 2003 study subjects with borderline personality disorder showed significantly greater left amygdala activity than normal control subjects some borderline patients even had difficulties classifying neutral faces or saw them as threatening 57 individuals with psychopathy show reduced autonomic responses to instructed fear cues than otherwise healthy individuals 58 in 2006 researchers observed hyperactivity in the amygdala when patients were shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations patients with severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased response in the amygdala 59 similarly depressed patients showed exaggerated left amygdala activity when interpreting emotions for all faces and especially for fearful faces this hyperactivity was normalized when patients were administered antidepressant medication 60 by contrast the amygdala has been observed to respond differently in people with bipolar disorder a 2003 study found that adult and adolescent bipolar patients tended to have considerably smaller amygdala volumes and somewhat smaller hippocampal volumes 61 many studies have focused on the connections between the amygdala and autism 62 studies in 2004 and 2006 showed that normal subjects exposed to images of frightened faces or faces of people from another race will show increased activity of the amygdala even if that exposure is subliminal 63 64 however the amygdala is not necessary for the processing of fear related stimuli since persons in whom it is bilaterally damaged show rapid reactions to fearful faces even in the absence of a functional amygdala 65 sexual orientation edit recent studies have suggested possible correlations between brain structure including differences in hemispheric ratios and connection patterns in the amygdala and sexual orientation homosexual men tend to exhibit more feminine patterns in the amygdala than heterosexual males do just as homosexual females tend to show more masculine patterns in the amygdala than heterosexual women do it was observed that amygdala connections were more widespread from the left amygdala in homosexual males as is also found in heterosexual females amygdala connections were more widespread from the right amygdala in homosexual females as in heterosexual males 66 67 social edit increased activity in the amygdala following compassion oriented meditation may contribute to social connectedness 68 similarly the structural white matter connectivity to other brain regions is also associated with social network size 69 amygdala volume correlates positively with both the size the number of contacts a person has and the complexity the number of different groups to which a person belongs of social networks 70 71 individuals with larger amygdalae had larger and more complex social networks the amygdala is responsible for facial recognition and allows others to respond appropriately to different emotional expressions 72 they were also better able to make accurate social judgments about other persons faces 73 the amygdala s role in the analysis of social situations stems specifically from its ability to identify and process changes in facial features it does not however process the direction of the gaze of the person being perceived 74 75 the amygdala is also thought to be a determinant of the level of a person s emotional intelligence it is particularly hypothesized that larger amygdalae allow for greater emotional intelligence enabling greater societal integration and cooperation with others 76 the amygdala processes reactions to violations concerning personal space these reactions are absent in persons in whom the amygdala is damaged bilaterally 77 furthermore the amygdala is found to be activated in fmri when people observe that others are physically close to them such as when a person being scanned knows that an experimenter is standing immediately next to the scanner versus standing at a distance 77 78 aggression edit animal studies have shown that stimulating the amygdala appears to increase both sexual and aggressive behavior likewise studies using brain lesions have shown that harm to the amygdala may produce the opposite effect thus it appears that this part of the brain may play a role in the display and modulation of aggression 79 fear edit there are cases of human patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesions due to the rare genetic condition urbach wiethe disease 80 81 such patients fail to exhibit fear related behaviors leading one s m to be dubbed the woman with no fear this finding reinforces the conclusion that the amygdala plays a pivotal role in triggering a state of fear 80 alcoholism and binge drinking edit the amygdala appears to play a role in binge drinking being damaged by repeated episodes of intoxication and withdrawal 82 83 protein kinase c epsilon in the amygdala is important for regulating behavioral responses to morphine ethanol and controlling anxiety like behavior the protein is involved in controlling the function of other proteins and plays a role in development of the ability to consume a large amount of ethanol 84 85 the duration of chronic alcohol consumption and abstinence may affect dynamic brain network adaptations 83 when excessive drinking occurs the amygdala is affected through behavioral changes and reduces the brain s plasticity brain plasticity is how our brain grows and develops it is also how our neurons can make connections with other neurons this ultimately increases our neural pathways allowing us to increase our knowledge of the world around us when our brain plasticity decreases it makes it difficult for neurons to make connections to other neurons often when binge drinking or alcoholism occurs our amygdala is affected and leads to behavior damage these behavioral damages can be lack of control inability to conduct oneself in a mature manner aggressive behavior loss of conduct anxiety depression personality disorders excessive drug intake bi polar disorder confusion higher tolerance levels irritability and inappropriate sexual behaviors with others and self 86 anxiety edit there may also be a link between the amygdala and anxiety 87 in particular there is a higher prevalence of females that are affected by anxiety disorders in an experiment degu pups were removed from their mother but allowed to hear her call in response the males produced increased serotonin receptors in the amygdala but females lost them this led to the males being less affected by the stressful situation the clusters of the amygdala are activated when an individual expresses feelings of fear or aggression this occurs because the amygdala is the primary structure of the brain responsible for fight or flight response anxiety and panic attacks can occur when the amygdala senses environmental stressors that stimulate fight or flight response the amygdala is directly associated with conditioned fear conditioned fear is the framework used to explain the behavior produced when an originally neutral stimulus is consistently paired with a stimulus that evokes fear the amygdala represents a core fear system in the human body which is involved in the expression of conditioned fear fear is measured by changes in autonomic activity including increased heart rate increased blood pressure as well as in simple reflexes such as flinching or blinking the central nucleus of the amygdala has direct correlations to the hypothalamus and brainstem areas directly related to fear and anxiety this connection is evident from studies of animals that have undergone amygdalae removal such studies suggest that animals lacking an amygdala have less fear expression and indulge in non species like behavior many projection areas of the amygdala are critically involved in specific signs that are used to measure fear and anxiety mammals have very similar ways of processing and responding to danger scientists have observed similar areas in the brain specifically in the amygdala lighting up or becoming more active when a mammal is threatened or beginning to experience anxiety similar parts of the brain are activated when rodents and humans alike observe a dangerous situation the amygdala playing a crucial role in this assessment by observing the amygdalae s functions it can determined why one rodent may be much more anxious than another there is a direct relationship between the activation of the amygdala and the level of anxiety the subject feels feelings of anxiety start with a catalyst an environmental stimulus that provokes stress this can include various smells sights and internal sensations that result in anxiety the amygdala reacts to this stimuli by preparing to either stand and fight or to turn and run this response is triggered by the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream consequently blood sugar rises becoming immediately available to the muscles for quick energy shaking may occur in an attempt to return blood to the rest of the body apart from initiation of stress long term changes in amygdala neurons may also increase anxiety after long term or traumatic stress led by the action of stress related hormones within the amygdala 88 on the flip side blocking the action of stress hormones in the amygdala reduces anxiety 89 a better understanding of the amygdala and its various functions may lead to a new way of treating clinical anxiety 90 posttraumatic stress disorder edit there seems to be a connection with the amygdalae and how the brain processes posttraumatic stress disorder multiple studies have found that the amygdalae may be responsible for the emotional reactions of ptsd patients one study in particular found that when ptsd patients are shown pictures of faces with fearful expressions their amygdalae tended to have a higher activation than someone without ptsd 91 bipolar disorder edit amygdala dysfunction during face emotion processing is well documented in bipolar disorder individuals with bipolar disorder showed greater amygdala activity especially the amygdala

edit origin story edit black mask s origin story was established in his first appearance roman sionis was born to wealthy and utterly self absorbed parents who cared more about their social status in gotham city than their own son moments after roman s birth the doctor carelessly dropped him on his head and his parents covered up the entire incident so that their high society friends would not find out years later he was attacked by a rabid raccoon at the sionis family country estate and his parents forbade him to mention the incident to anyone despite their dislike for fellow socialites thomas and martha wayne roman s parents continued to associate with them to maintain their social standing and forced roman to befriend their son bruce his parents hypocrisy had a deep impact on roman and he grew to resent them and the masks that they wore in public 6 after graduating from high school roman was given a high ranking position in his father s company janus cosmetics there he met and fell in love with working class model circe though his parents did not approve of the relationship and forced him to break it off enraged roman burned down his family mansion killing both of his parents and inheriting their fortune and business roman lacked his father s business acumen and eventually ruined janus cosmetics by funding a failed line of face paint make up desperate roman had the staff chemists create a product that was rushed to the market without proper testing disfiguring several hundred women circe now roman s fiancée then broke up with him in front of his entire staff 6 bruce wayne now the head of wayne enterprises offered to bail janus cosmetics out on the condition that roman gave up control and allowed wayne to appoint his own board of directors humiliated and furious roman broke into the cemetery where his parents were buried before he could unlock the sionis crypt a lightning bolt struck him blasting the door open and hurling roman head first into a nearby stone roman took the incident as an omen of his rebirth and entered the crypt smashing his father s ebony casket with the stone and using its shattered pieces to carve an ebony mask resembling a scowling face starting a new life as the crime lord black mask 7 criminal career edit within a month black mask had assembled a group of dozens of criminals called the false face society using the sionis crypt as their base of operations each member of the false face society wore a distinctive mask and the gang s crime spree spread rapidly throughout gotham eventually attracting the attentions of the police and bruce wayne now operating as the vigilante batman 8 to settle old scores black mask murdered three wayne foundation executives and kidnapped circe forcing her to don a mask laced with janus cosmetics toxic makeup sparing her life but permanently disfiguring her face black mask then threatened circe into rejoining him giving her a mannequin mask intentionally designed to mock

ball at wayne manor and sionis infiltrated the ball and lured bruce to the mansion s conservatory to kill him bruce disarmed sionis forcing the latter to retreat to his hideout with robin jason todd secretly following him while batman and robin fought his underlings at the graveyard black mask escaped through a false bottom installed in his father s coffin and headed to his family estate black mask then entered his old bedroom and set fire to the old toys inside intending to burn the mansion to the ground to symbolically kill his old identity as sionis before black mask could escape batman flung a batarang attached cable around the crime lord s knees causing him to fall face first on the burning floor just as the bedroom s rafters began to collapse the rafters pinned black mask s face into the pile of burning toys and although batman and robin were able to tow him out of the fire sionis mask had been burned onto his face 9 black mask was subsequently sent to arkham asylum where he remained behind bars until the international terrorist ra s al ghul freed all of its inmates black mask was not amongst the criminals who followed the joker in searching for the one behind the

with batman the player character 37 pyg also made minor appearances in the animated series batman the brave and the bold and the video game injustice 2 5 in the harley quinn episode there s nowhere to go but down pyg makes a brief silent cameo among the prisoners in bane s pit lazlo valentin played by michael cerveris makes his live action debut in the fourth season of the television series gotham the character is introduced under his professor pyg alias as a vigilante who slaughters corrupt policemen and dresses their corpses with pigs heads 38 executive producer bryan wynbrandt described him as the big villain of the first half of the season 39 the character s modus operandi later expands he targets the wealthy who he claims fed on the poor of gotham 40 police captain james gordon learns professor pyg is a persona used by valentin a contract murderer who impersonates serial killers he is hired by crime figure sofia falcone in a conspiracy to turn the corrupt police against kingpin oswald cobblepot and usurp his criminal empire falcone kills valentin to keep the conspiracy quiet 41 dc rebirth and introduction in film edit in may 2016 dc comics again relaunched their entire line of comic books under the dc rebirth brand restoring elements of the dc universe that were erased under the new 52 while maintaining the continuity 42 pyg re appears in 2017 s nightwing 18 operating in paris and creating dollotron versions of grayson and damian wayne known as deathwing and robintron grayson and wayne overcome pyg who tells them he created deathwing and robintron for simon hurt 43 he later appears in harley quinn 43 44 and batgirl and the birds of prey 44 he appears again in batwoman 11 in which batwoman saves her ally julia pennyworth from pyg after alice leaks her secret identity to him 45 professor pyg is among the villains who feature in the intercompany crossover the shadow batman in which batman and the shadow team up to combat a conspiracy 46 47 pyg makes his film debut voiced by james urbaniak in the 2018 animated film suicide squad hell to pay 48 in which he is depicted as an underground surgeon for hire for supervillains in the limited series doomsday clock a sequel to the seminal 1986 watchmen pyg is among the supervillains who attend an underground meeting held by riddler 49 in a story in dc s 2018 halloween anthology cursed comics cavalcade damian wayne teams up with the zombie solomon grundy against professor pyg after he kidnaps a group of children 50 in january 2019 the mister miracle creative team tom king and mitch geralds reunited for batman 62 which was promoted as a special issue pyg holds batman captive as he recalls the mythical pygmalion and considers how he psychologically mirrors pyg 51 52 characterization and symbolism edit like the pygmalion of myth lazlo fancies himself something of a sculptor except he doesn t work in clay or marble he s much more fascinated with transforming living human bodies he has no real rhyme or reason for his crime he s really only motivated by his art there s no vendetta or plan or higher purpose pyg doesn t follow a pattern or even build up to a punchline he s not really angling for pure chaos like the joker but he s also not systematic like victor zsasz he just wants to spread his own twisted idea of perfection in his work no matter the cost meg downey in a dc comics editorial 53 professor pyg is usually characterized in comic books as someone who is suffering from severe mental illness cocreator grant morrison envisioned him as one of the weirdest most insane characters that s ever been in batman comics and said we hear a lot about batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected professor pyg isn t from another world he s from here but he s very very sick taking inspiration from the works of david lynch morrison wanted the visuals in batman reborn illustrated by frank quitely to feel like a real world crossing over with a world of schizophrenia paranoia and the use of narcotics they ve stated that when batman and robin are facing pyg and his dollotrons they are dealing with the eerie creepy mentally ill dark corners of life 2 the character uses drugs lobotomy and doll masks permanently molded onto people s faces to turn them into genderless dollotrons which he believes are perfected human beings 54 55 the name pyg is a shortening of pygmalion george bernard shaw s play that was adapted into the musical my fair lady starring rex harrison which tells the story of a professor s attempt to convert a street urchin into an educated high society woman according to morrison movie enthusiasts will know that rex harrison also played doctor doolittle who by strange coincidence was famed for teaching barnyard animals to speak proper so our professor pyg mixes all these characteristics and influences together to create a monster who wants to make everything and everyone perfect as he sees it 4 on the dc comics website journalist meg downey notes parallels between professor pyg s view of his dollotrons and the greek mythological figure pygmalion who carved a statue of a woman out of ivory that was so realistic and beautiful he fell in love with his creation 56 morrison referred to the character s experiments to force biology to conform to his will as an attempt to dominate and redefine the feminine principle comparing it to the wire mother experiments performed by psychologist harry harlow on infant monkeys and to the proto mother mythologies of mesopotamia and ancient babylon the shattered mind of lazlo valentin has mashed all of these connections into a frightening personal mythos constructed to justify his deranged activities as professor pyg 3 morrison also said pyg s deranged rants in batman and robin must die allude to animal experimentation carried out in the us in the mid twentieth century including harlow and john b calhoun s rockville barn rat population research which collectively influenced the character s origin story 57 in the comics pyg has a makeshift mother constructed from boards and nails from which auditory hallucinations continuously compel him to improve his work 8 in batman 62 bruce wayne compares pyg s love for his work to his own fixation with vigilantism having built up his ideals and philosophies since he witnessed his parents being murdered as a boy 58 pyg was adapted differently from the comics in the television series beware the batman developer glen murakami said it s not like we re trying to change it but we only have 22 minutes to tell that story the theme that we went in with pyg and toad was kind of wind in the willows but they also became like a twisted sherlock holmes and watson it felt like it flowed it felt like it had a theme that seemed more important for that to track rather than all the backstory 59 chris sims of the journalism website comicsalliance said the changes are about as far from melting people s faces stripping in front of a wire mother and dosing gotham city with a psychotropic drug as you re likely to get 36 according to comic book resources writer kieran shiach the arkham knight iteration is a very accurate facsimile of the original comic book portrayal the major difference being the character s new enthusiasm for opera music 5 pyg s in game attributes label him a perfectionist and an amateur opera vocalist before his confrontation with batman during which pyg describes his surgical operations as fixing his victims who are unique and broken batman is warned by alfred pennyworth that pyg is unhinged even by gotham s standards after pyg s capture he claims his mutilated victims are works of art and while in a police lockup he expresses concern for how they are being treated 37 in the television series gotham lazlo valentin is portrayed as a contract killer who impersonates other serial killers he creates an elaborate persona of a murderer under the professor pyg alias to aid sofia falcone s rise to power in gotham city s criminal underworld 60 actor michael cerveris said of the faux persona professor pyg is a brilliant and chameleon like person who has a highly developed sense of what s right and wrong it just might not be a sense of right and wrong that corresponds with everybody else s executive producer john stephens said the character was chosen for the show because he hits that sweet spot of being grotesque and terrifying but also a little bit in that fairy tale esque world cerveris said pyg takes delight in his actions and sees himself as a mirror image to james gordon who also wants to end corruption in the gotham city police department pyg spells his name with a y as an homage to pygmalion and because he wants to remake gotham city in his own image he also wants to make gordon into a better version of himself according to cerveris he is almost looking at gordon as an ally like i m on your side jim and jim is saying no you re actually a sociopath so it works in many ways as a seduction on pyg s part as he tries to pull jim in 61 62 in early episodes of gotham pyg claims to have suffered at the hands of gotham city s elite implying a troubled past for the pyg persona and a vengeful motive cerveris stated pyg is aware of his actions but may not be comfortable with himself which may be partly because he is covering his true identity layers of his disguise are continuously stripped down and reapplied 63 hailing from the southern united states valentin uses implanted shifting metal plates and facial reconstruction to help him hide his true identity 64 before the pyg persona is revealed to be fake cerveris said he lacks his alter ego s trademark surgical prowess because it was intended to focus more on his relationship with the city and james gordon and that the dollotrons are not the sole purpose of his existence cerveris also said the dollotrons might be a later part of valentin s life because the show is about the origins of the batman mythos 65 design edit professor pyg s traditional pig mask was adapted into one more resembling the flesh of a pig that according to michael cerveris gave it a more disturbing and comedic quality professor pyg most commonly wears a pig mask 66 a makeshift surgical outfit 54 and a butcher s apron much of his original wardrobe in the comic books was designed by frank quitely and is a homage to the edwardian suits worn by rex harrison in my fair lady 3 the television series gotham was planned to feature a pig mask that more closely resembled the comic book version but it was deemed a little too cheery and pink executive producer danny cannon decided the mask should look like decapitated pig flesh cerveris found the change to be simultaneously comical and disturbing he had some difficulty acting in the mask due to its weight and the heat underneath and because it blocked his peripheral vision according to cerveris the mask is a really freeing aspect and i felt naked when i didn t have the mask on and couldn t really be professor pyg pyg retains his apron from the source material 61 63 67 merchandise edit professor pyg s opera suite titled ode to perfection was composed by david buckley for the batman arkham knight soundtrack 68 69 an action figure of the character was released as part of the third series of arkham knight figures from dc collectibles in february 2016 70 critical response edit meg downey said professor pyg is one of batman s most disturbing villains 56 in 2015 ign writers jesse schedeen and joshua yehl ranked professor pyg as the twenty third greatest batman villain of all time 71 and in a separate editorial schedeen called pyg one of the crazier and more unusual batman villains created by grant morrison 66 beth elderkin of io9 called the character one of the weirdest villains to come out of the batman canon while bustle referred to him as one of the comics modern masterpieces and one of its most horrifying creations 72 73 david pepose of newsarama praised the inclusion of professor pyg and jason bard in batman eternal for emphasizing elements of the dc universe that were underused following the new 52 74 comic book resources s mike fugere said the character is a bigger monster than solomon grundy an undead creature within the dc universe who fugere calls terrifying he cited the comic book cursed comics cavalcade 1 as his reason a story in which grundy tries to stop pyg from mutilating a group of children according to fugere pyg is basically hannibal lecter on steroids and is a reminder that not all superhero comics are for kids he also said grant morrison accomplished his goal of making pyg one of the weirdest and most insane characters in batman comic books 50 in 2017 john stephens said professor pyg is one of his favorite recently created batman villains for being demented grotesque and funny because the character was created recently he also said pyg is more contemporary than the classic rogues and did not have to be revitalized as much 55 when it was announced professor pyg would appear on gotham digital spy commented gotham season 4 is going to introduce its most disturbing villain ever so forget about sleeping ever again 75 charlie ridgely of comicbook com stated pyg s appearance on gotham proved he is one of the most disturbed villains who has served as an antagonist to batman 76 see also edit list of beware the batman characters list of gotham characters references edit cowsill alan irvine alex

able to recognize itself in a mirror test 3 they are particularly well known for their songs and were once popular as cagebirds in addition to other members of the genus pica corvids considered as

previous centuries was to give birds common names such as robin redbreast which now is called the robin jenny wren etc the magpie was originally variously maggie pie and mag pie 6 the term pica for the human disorder involving a compulsive desire to eat items that are not food is borrowed from the latin name of the magpie pica pica for its reputed tendency to feed on miscellaneous things 7 systematics and species edit according to some studies magpies do not form the monophyletic group they are traditionally believed to be tails have elongated or shortened independently in multiple lineages of corvid birds 8 among the traditional magpies two distinct lineages apparently exist one consists of holarctic species with black and white colouration and is probably closely related to crows and eurasian jays the other contains several species from south to east asia with vivid colouration which is predominantly green or blue the azure winged magpie and the iberian magpie formerly thought to constitute a single species with a most peculiar distribution have been shown to be two distinct species and are classified as the genus cyanopica 9 other research has cast doubt on the taxonomy of the pica magpies since p hudsonia and p nuttalli may not be different species whereas the korean race of p pica is genetically very distinct from the other eurasian as well as the north american forms either the north american korean and remaining eurasian forms are accepted as three or four separate species or else only a single species pica pica exists 10 holarctic black and white

is conspicuously pied with black and white plumage reminiscent of a eurasian magpie it is a member of the family artamidae and not a corvid the magpie robins members of the genus copsychus have a similar pied appearance but they are old world flycatchers unrelated to the corvids human interactions edit cultural references edit see also eurasian_magpie relationship_with_humans and black billed_magpie relationship_with_humans east asia edit in east asian cultures the magpie is a very popular bird and is a symbol of good luck and fortune the magpie is a common subject in chinese paintings it is also often found in traditional chinese poetry and couplets in addition in the folklore of china all the magpies of the qixi festival every year will fly to the milky way and form a bridge where the separated cowherd and weaver girl will meet in their culture the milky way is like a river and the cowherd and weaver girl refer to the famous α aquilae and α lyrae of modern astronomy respectively for this reason the magpie bridge has come to symbolize a relationship between men and women magpies have an important place in the birth myth of ai xinjue luo bukuri yushun the ancestor of the qing dynasty the magpie is a national bird of korea europe edit in european culture the magpie is reputed to collect shiny objects such as wedding rings and other valuables a well known example being rossini s opera la gazza ladra the thieving magpie a recent study conducted by exeter university found that eurasian magpies express neophobia when presented with unfamiliar objects and were less likely to approach or interact with the shiny objects metal screws foil rings and aluminium foil used in the experiments 11 however magpies are naturally curious like other members of the corvid family and may collect shiny objects but do not favour shiny objects over dull ones 12 in england a magpie s nest was a phrase used to describe something untidy and usually of little value there is also a superstitious belief associated with magpies in the uk whereby the sight of a single magpie is said to bring sorrow or bad luck the sight of two magpies is said to bring joy or good luck and viewing more than two magpies is said to determine the sex of a future child as described in the traditional nursery rhyme one for sorrow as pests edit magpies are common orchard

practice 1 the name comes from the latin for to speak from the stomach venter belly and loqui speak 2 the greeks called this gastromancy greek εγγαστριμυθία citation needed the noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist the ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead as well as foretell the future one of the earliest recorded group of prophets to use this technique was the pythia the priestess at the temple of apollo in delphi who acted as the conduit for the delphic oracle one of the most successful early gastromancers was eurykles a prophet at athens gastromancers came to be referred to as euryklides in his honour 3 other parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes historically there have been adepts of this practice among the zulu inuit and māori peoples 3 emergence as entertainment edit sadler s wells theatre in the early 19th century at a time when ventriloquist acts were becoming increasingly popular the shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at travelling funfairs and market towns an early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in england where sir john parnell is depicted in the painting an election entertainment by william hogarth as speaking via his hand 4 in 1757 the austrian baron de mengen performed with a small doll 5 by the late 18th century ventriloquist performances were an established form of entertainment in england although most performers threw their voice to make it appear that it emanated from far away known as distant ventriloquism rather than the modern method of using a puppet near ventriloquism a a well known ventriloquist of the period joseph askins who performed at the sadler s wells theatre in london in the 1790s advertised his act as curious ad libitum dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar little tommy 6 however other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance notably the irishman james burne who carries in his pocket an ill shaped doll with a broad face which he exhibits as giving utterance to his own childish jargon and thomas garbutt the entertainment came of age during the era of the music hall in the united kingdom and vaudeville in the united states george sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at nottingham in the 1830s but it is fred russell who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism in 1886 he was offered a professional engagement at the palace theatre in london and took up his stage career permanently his act based on the cheeky boy dummy coster joe that would sit in his lap and engage in a dialogue with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers a blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of russell by the british heritage society which reads fred russell the father of ventriloquism lived here 7

captive american flamingos feeding the name flamingo comes from portuguese or spanish flamengo flame colored which in turn comes from provençal flamenc a combination of flama flame and a germanic like suffix ing the word may also have been influenced by the spanish ethnonym flamenco fleming or flemish the name of the genus phoenicopterus is from the greek φοινικόπτερος phoinikopteros lit crimson red feathered 3 other genera names include phoeniconaias which means crimson red water nymph or naiad and phoenicoparrus which means crimson red bird though an unknown bird of omen taxonomy and systematics the family phoenicopteridae was introduced by the french zoologist charles lucien bonaparte in 1831 with phoenicopterus as the type genus 4 5 traditionally the long legged ciconiiformes probably a paraphyletic assemblage have been considered the flamingos closest relatives and the family was included in the order usually the ibises and spoonbills of the threskiornithidae were considered their closest relatives within this order earlier genetic studies such as those of charles sibley and colleagues also supported this relationship 6 relationships to the waterfowl were considered as well 7 especially as flamingos are parasitized by feather lice of the genus anaticola which are otherwise exclusively found on ducks and geese 8 the peculiar presbyornithids were used to argue for a close relationship between flamingos waterfowl and waders 9 a 2002 paper concluded they are waterfowl 10 but a 2014 comprehensive study of bird orders found that flamingos and grebes are not waterfowl but rather are part of columbea along with doves sandgrouse and mesites 11 relationship with grebes many molecular and morphological studies support a relationship between grebes and flamingos recent molecular studies have suggested a relation with grebes 12 13 14 while morphological evidence also strongly supports a relationship between flamingos and grebes they hold at least 11 morphological traits in common which are not found in other birds many of these characteristics have been previously identified on flamingos but not on grebes 15 the fossil palaelodids can be considered evolutionarily and ecologically intermediate between flamingos and grebes 16 for the grebe flamingo clade the taxon mirandornithes miraculous birds due to their extreme divergence and apomorphies has been proposed alternatively they could be placed in one order with phoenocopteriformes taking priority 16 phylogeny living flamingos 17 phoenicopterus p chilensis chilean flamingo p

late oligocene of south australia description flamingos usually stand on one leg with the other tucked beneath the body the reason for this behaviour is not fully understood one theory is that standing on one leg allows the birds to conserve more body heat given that they spend a significant amount of time wading in cold water 23 however the behaviour also takes place in warm water and is also observed in birds that do not typically stand in water an alternative theory is that standing on one leg reduces the energy expenditure for producing muscular effort to stand and balance on one leg a study on cadavers showed that the one legged pose could be held without any muscle activity while living flamingos demonstrate substantially less body sway in a one legged posture 24 as well as standing in the water flamingos may stamp their webbed feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom 25 flamingos are capable flyers and flamingos in captivity often require wing clipping to prevent escape a pair of african flamingos which had not yet had their wings clipped escaped from the wichita kansas zoo in 2005 one was spotted in texas 14 years later it had been seen previously by birders in texas wisconsin and louisiana 26 american and chilean flamingos in captivity flamingos in flight at río lagartos yucatán mexico young flamingos hatch with grayish red plumage but adults range from light pink to bright red due to aqueous bacteria and beta carotene obtained from their food supply a well fed healthy flamingo is more vibrantly colored thus a more desirable mate a white or pale flamingo however is usually unhealthy or malnourished captive flamingos are a notable exception they may turn a pale pink if they are not fed carotene at levels comparable to the wild 27 the greater flamingo is the tallest of the six different species of flamingos standing at 3 9 to 4 7 feet 1 2 to 1 4 m with a weight up to 7 7 pounds 3 5 kg and the shortest flamingo species the lesser has a height of 2 6 feet 0 8 m and weighs 5 5 pounds 2 5 kg flamingos can have a wingspan as small as 37 inches 94 cm to as big as 59 inches 150 cm 28 flamingos can open their bills by raising the upper jaw as well as by dropping the lower 29 behavior and ecology feeding american flamingos vocalizing at the stone zoo in massachusetts usa american flamingo and offspring the arcuate curved bill is adapted to bottom scooping flamingos filter feed on brine shrimp and blue green algae as well as insect larvae small insects mollusks and crustaceans making them omnivores their bills are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat and are uniquely used upside down the filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae which line the mandibles and the large rough surfaced tongue the pink or reddish color of flamingos comes from carotenoids in their diet of animal and plant plankton american flamingos are a brighter red color because of the beta carotene availability in their food while the lesser flamingos are a paler pink due to ingesting a smaller amount of this pigment these carotenoids are broken down into pigments by liver enzymes 30 the source of this varies by species and affects the color saturation flamingos whose sole diet is blue green algae are darker than those that get it second hand by eating animals that have digested blue green algae 31 vocalization sounds flamingos are considered very noisy birds with their noises and vocalizations ranging from grunting or growling to nasal honking vocalizations play an important role in parent chick recognition ritualized displays and keeping large flocks together variations in vocalizations exist in the voices of different species of flamingos 32 33 lifecycle chilean flamingo feeding its young colony of flamingos at lake nakuru flamingos are very social birds they live in colonies whose population can number in the thousands these large colonies are believed to serve three purposes for the flamingos avoiding predators maximizing food intake and using scarce suitable nesting sites more efficiently 34 before breeding flamingo colonies split into breeding groups of about 15 to 50 birds both males and females in these groups perform synchronized ritual displays 35 the members of a group stand together and display to each other by stretching their necks upwards then uttering calls while head flagging and then flapping their wings 36 the displays do not seem directed towards an individual but occur randomly 36 these displays stimulate synchronous nesting see below and help pair up those birds that do not already have mates 35 flamingos form strong pair bonds although in larger colonies flamingos sometimes change mates presumably because more mates are available to choose 37 flamingo pairs establish and defend nesting territories they locate a suitable spot on the mudflat to build a nest the female usually selects the place 36 copulation usually occurs during nest building which is sometimes interrupted by another flamingo pair trying to commandeer the nesting site for their use flamingos aggressively defend their nesting sites both the male and the female contribute to building the nest and to protecting the nest and egg 38 same sex pairs have been reported 39 after the chicks hatch the only parental expense is feeding 40 both the male and the female feed their chicks with a kind of crop milk produced in glands lining the whole of the upper digestive tract not just the crop the hormone prolactin stimulates production the milk contains fat protein and red and white blood cells pigeons and doves columbidae also produce crop milk just in the glands lining the crop which contains less fat and more protein than flamingo crop milk 41 for the first six days after the chicks hatch the adults and chicks stay in the nesting sites at around 7 12 days old the chicks begin to move out of their nests and explore their surroundings when they are two weeks old the chicks congregate in groups called microcrèches and their parents leave them alone after a while the microcrèches merge into crèches containing thousands of chicks chicks that do not stay in their crèches are vulnerable to predators 42 status and conservation see also list of phoenicopteriformes by population in captivity the first flamingo hatched in a european zoo was a chilean flamingo at zoo basel in switzerland in 1958 since then over 389 flamingos have grown up in basel and been distributed to other zoos around the globe 43 greater an at least 83 year old greater flamingo believed to be the oldest in the world died at the adelaide zoo in australia in january 2014 44 zoos have used mirrors to improve flamingo breeding behaviour the mirrors are thought to give the flamingos the impression that they are in a larger flock than they actually are 45 flamingos in ancient roman cuisine pink flamingo prepared for cooking bardo museum while many different kinds of birds were valued items in roman food flamingos were among the most prized in ancient roman cuisine an early reference to their consumption and especially of their tongues is found in pliny the elder who states in the natural history latin phoenicopteri linguam praecipui saporis esse apicius docuit nepotum omnium altissimus gurges translated apicius that very deepest whirlpool of all our epicures has informed us that the tongue of the phœnicopterus is of the most exquisite flavour natural history liber x chapter 67 46 47 although a few recipes for flamingos are found in apicius extant works none refer specifically to flamingo tongues the three flamingo recipes in the de re coquinaria on the subject of cooking involve the whole creature 220 roasted with an egg sauce a recipe for wood pigeons squabs fattened fowl flamingo is an afterthought 230 boiled parrot may be substituted 231 roasted with a must sauce 48 suetonius mentions flamingo tongues in his life of vitellius 49 most notorious of all was the dinner given by his brother to celebrate the emperor s arrival in rome at which two thousand of the choicest fishes and seven thousand birds are said to have been served he himself eclipsed even this at the dedication of a platter which on account of its enormous size he called the shield of minerva defender of the city in this he mingled the livers of pike the brains of pheasants and peacocks the tongues of flamingoes and the milt of lampreys brought by his captains and triremes from the whole empire from parthia to the spanish strait suetonius life of vitellius 50 martial the poet devoted an ironic epigram alluding to flamingo tongues latin dat mihi penna rubens nomen sed lingua gulosis nostra sapit quid si garrula lingua foret translated my red wing gives me my name but it is my tongue that is considered savoury by epicures what if my tongue had been able to sing epigrammata 71 book 13 51 52 there is also a mention of flamingo brains in a later highly contentious source detailing in the life of elagabalus a food item not apparently to his liking as much as camels heels and parrot tongues in the belief that the latter was a prophylactic in imitation of apicius he frequently ate camels heels and also cocks combs taken from the living birds and the tongues of peacocks and nightingales because he was told that one who ate them was immune from the plague he served to the palace attendants moreover huge platters heaped up with the viscera of mullets and flamingo brains partridge eggs thrush brains and the heads of parrots pheasants and peacocks

henchmen of sonar 10 cluemaster reappears in detective comics 647 by chuck dixon and tom lyle in this three issue story cluemaster has reformed and been released from blackgate penitentiary cured of his compulsion to leave clues cluemaster originally joins a gang and plans their heists in exchange for 10 percent of their winnings he later kills the leader by suffocating him with a strong polymer

incarceration stephanie is furious when she discovers that he has returned to crime without his need to leave clues behind making a costume for herself she calls herself the spoiler finds out her father s plans and leaves clues so that the police and batman can stop him 11 robin spots spoiler on the rooftops during a police bust of cluemaster s apartment and unmasks her though she incapacitates robin by hitting him in the face with a brick robin tracks her down and batman robin and spoiler set a plan in motion to take down cluemaster spoiler was forbidden from going to the bust

sees his friends big sir clock king and multi man die though multi man has the power to be reborn again in the resulting chaotic battle cluemaster seemingly saves major disaster s life twice though the major admits the situation was confusing cluemaster is seen shot many times through the chest he survives this incident with a year s recuperation in the hospital and many many scars he is encouraged by thoughts of his daughter 12 when he gets out and discovers that his daughter has been killed he takes on the secret identity aaron black and creates the campaign for culpability blaming batman for his involvement in stephanie s death saying that she was not the first child working with batman to die and that batman should be brought to justice it is later revealed that stephanie survived the incident that everyone believed had killed her and spent some time recuperating overseas 13 robin vol 2 177 was planned by chuck dixon intended to feature cluemaster but dixon s abrupt

villains when interrupted by his daughter stephanie brown who overhears part of the plotting by her father and his associates this is cluemaster s first full appearance in the new 52 continuity 16 he is later revealed to be the final mastermind behind the systematic attack on batman by various villains inspired by an old theory he had when talking with other lower grade villains that they could take action while batman was occupied with the bigger criminals he sent out invitations to other big league foes to take action after the fall of commissioner gordon and then all he had to do was slip a basic mind control drug into gordon s coffee to make him see a threat that wasn t there and let the other villains do what they wanted guessing correctly that batman would never think to look at a small timer when so many bigger villains were playing a part in the scheme although brown manages to capture and unmask batman bruce is able to escape his bonds and fight back but he has taken such a beating over the course of the storyline that cluemaster manages to overpower him only for lincoln march to show up behind cluemaster and slit his throat 17 revealing that he funded cluemaster s plans solely so that he could kill batman at this point in secret 18 dc rebirth edit during the war of jokes and riddles cluemaster is seen as a member of joker s team 19 after batman joins the war on the

is then gassed by the scarecrow one of riddler s allies and taken out of the conflict powers and abilities edit unlike most of batman s villains cluemaster is completely sane which gives him a unique

other media 7 reception 8 see also 9 references 10 external links character and publication history creation batman co creator bob kane was a great movie fan and his love for film provided the impetus for several batman characters among them catwoman kane s inspiration for catwoman was drawn from multiple sources to include actresses jean harlow hedy lamarr and his cousin ruth steele 10 11 12 kane and finger wanted to give their comic book sex appeal as well as a character who could appeal to female readers they thus created a friendly foe who committed crimes but was also a romantic interest in batman s rather sterile life 13 catwoman was meant to be a love interest and to engage batman in a chess game with him trying to reform her at the same time this character was meant to be different from other batman villains like the joker in that she was never a killer or evil selina kyle s first appearance as the cat in batman 1 spring 1940 as for using cat imagery with the character kane stated that he and finger saw cats as kind of the antithesis of bats 14 i felt that women were feline creatures and men were more like dogs while dogs are faithful and friendly cats are cool detached and unreliable i felt much warmer with dogs around me cats are as hard to understand as women are men feel more sure of themselves with a male friend than a woman you always need to keep women at arm s length we don t want anyone taking over our souls and women have a habit of doing that so there s a love resentment thing with women i guess women will feel that i m being chauvinistic to speak this way but i do feel that i ve had better relationships with male friends than women with women once the romance is over somehow they never remain my friends bob kane 15 golden age catwoman then called

batman 84 june 1954 and detective comics 211 september 1954 which were her two final appearances until 1966 this was mostly due to her possible violation of the developing comics code authority s

called the cat illac this usage also appeared in the 1960s batman television series in her post crisis appearances catwoman s favored weapon is a whip she wields both a standard bullwhip and a cat o nine tails with expert proficiency she uses the whip because it is a weapon that the user must be trained to use and therefore it can not be taken from her and used against her in a confrontation she can also be seen using a pistol against people if her whip is taken from her catwoman uses caltrops as an anti personnel weapon and bolas to entangle opponents at a distance catwoman has also been shown to have various items to restrain her victims such as rope for binding hands and feet and a roll of duct tape used to gag her targets as she has done with various victims during her robberies

first of the robins to be biologically related to batman the group consists of similarly minded superheroes who operate in the gotham city area and work towards achieving common goals batman is often the team leader or in some cases its dispatch various members of the group usually interact with one another and assist in each other s cases even within their respective series although some members occasionally resent batman s intrusion into their lives all respect him as a legend within the superhero community and rarely dare to challenge his authority 1 most of the members also have a strong rapport with the dark knight due to their long and close relationships with him over the years and consider him a close friend and ally and acknowledge that he most likely shares that sentiment no matter how averse he is to actually showing it 2 in a 2002 storyline in which bruce wayne is accused of murder batman s friends gather to prove his innocence 3 it has also been implied through batman

1940 as a b list actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain that he had portrayed in a horror film 2 the character only appeared twice in the golden age but was the inspiration for the shape shifting silver age version 3 in the late 1950s batman began facing a series of science fiction inspired foes including matt hagen a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by exposure to a pool of radioactive protoplasm who became the second clayface he retained the title for the next several decades of comic book history 4 in the late 1970s preston payne became the third clayface 5 a scientist suffering from hyperpituitarism preston payne used the second clayface s blood to create a cure for his condition but instead became a clay like creature that needed to pass his new condition on to others to survive sondra fuller of strike force kobra used the terrorist group s technology to become the fourth clayface also known as lady clay she formed the mud pack with the original and third clayfaces during this era the original clayface used the dna of payne and fuller to become the ultimate clayface as he now called himself sometime after the mud pack event payne and fuller had a son named cassius clay payne who as the fifth clayface also had metahuman shapeshifting powers in a 1998 storyline dr peter malloy later used a sample of cassius payne s skin to become a claything when he was introduced in batman 550 january 1998 in 2002 the todd russell version of clayface was introduced in catwoman vol 3 4 may 2002 and in 2005 the johnny williams version of clayface was introduced in batman gotham knights 60 february 2005 fictional character biography edit basil karlo edit golden age edit the original version of clayface basil karlo first appeared in detective comics 40 june 1940 6 he is a b list actor who is driven insane when he hears that a remake of the classic horror film he had starred in dread castle would be shot without him acting in the film even though he is to be one of the advising staff donning the costume of clayface a villain he once played in a different movie he begins killing the actors playing characters he killed in the order and way they die in the film along with someone who knew his identity last he plans to murder the actor playing the clayface killer he is foiled by batman and robin 7 he reappears after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff he once again dons the mask of clayface and targets bruce wayne s fiancée julie madison once again the dynamic duo foil his plans 8 a movie buff batman co creator bob kane states that the character was partially inspired by the 1925 lon chaney sr version of the phantom of the opera and that the name of the character came from a combination of boris karloff and basil rathbone 9 silver age edit while earth one s version of clayface has a similar history he was only seen in a flashback as alice chilton reminiscences about bruce wayne s growth from when her son joe chill shot thomas wayne and martha wayne to his path to becoming batman 10 imposter john carlinger edit john carlinger was a renowned actor and director of horror movies who held a film exhibition aboard the yacht varania iii basil karlo the original clayface assaulted carlinger with murderous intent because carlinger neglected to invite him to the event but carlinger killed karlo instead feeling threatened by a few actors attending the exhibition who were rumored to be demanding an audit of his production company s finances carlinger used karlo s alter ego to mask his true identity and intentions when he gunned these actors down in cold blood the batman deduced clayface s true identity by the water solubility of his makeup revealing it to be a type of makeup used by modern actors instead of the greasepaint karlo was more likely to use batman punched carlinger s lights out and exposed his murder scheme putting the corrupt movie producer s brief stint as clayface to an abrupt end 11 post crisis edit in the post crisis continuity karlo languishes in a prison hospital when the current clayface sondra fuller visits him out of curiosity karlo proposes an alliance between all living clayfaces to kill batman and did an attempt to resurrect matt hagen he even arranges for a small piece of the remains of matt hagen to be gathered to make him a post mortem member of the mud pack as the group called itself even though the mud pack is defeated karlo injects himself with blood samples from preston payne and sondra fuller gaining the abilities to shapeshift and melt with a touch he becomes the self declared ultimate clayface he is defeated by the combined efforts of batman and looker of the outsiders by overloading his abilities making him melt into the ground he literally sinks into the earth s crust when he loses control of his powers 12 13 he survives however and now his body sports crystals similar to quartz that endow him with greater power karlo escapes his underground prison when gotham city is struck by a great cataclysm he captures batman and is about to kill him but he gets into a feud with mr freeze about who has a right to kill the caped crusader using that distraction batman soundly defeats both of them 14 during the no man s land storyline karlo holds poison ivy prisoner in robinson park after she is freed from her prison by batman poison ivy battles and defeats karlo sinking him deep into the ground it appears that the ultimate clayface is destroyed in this battle 15 during the infinite crisis storyline clayface resurfaces as a member of alexander luthor jr s secret society of super villains 16 later he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing wonder woman a clay construct similar to him giving him an amount of powers that border on invulnerability while he is successful in absorbing some of the heroine s powers causing her to regress to a teenage appearance resembling donna troy he is ultimately returned to normal when wonder woman and donna were able to trick clayface into entering a train carriage with wonder woman while she was disguised as donna donna subsequently using the lasso of truth to swing the carriage around and turn it into a mystical centrifuge causing the clay clayface had taken from wonder woman to split away from him and re merge with wonder woman due to the differences between the two types of clay 17 basil karlo is among the members of the injustice league and is among the villains seen in salvation run during the final crisis storyline clayface can be seen as a member of libra s secret society of super villains he triggers an explosion at the daily planet under libra s orders when lex luthor orders libra to do something that will draw superman to them 18 black mask attempts to control karlo by implanting a device in his body he escapes black mask but is captured and imprisoned by the outsiders 19 the new 52 edit in 2011 the new 52 rebooted the dc universe as a part of the death of the family storyline poison ivy breaks basil karlo out of arkham claiming she wants to marry him 20 this turns out to be a ruse however ivy is using him as part of a larger scheme upon realizing this he seeks revenge 21 karlo later returns with a new plan to use his dna duplication abilities to impersonate bruce wayne and take control of wayne enterprises he even guesses that wayne is batman s true identity however batman plants false evidence to suggest that he anticipated karlo s attempt to take his dna and tricked him into taking a fake sample batman eventually stops karlo by trapping him in a security system that can only be deactivated with karlo s original dna reasoning that he has changed too much for his original dna to be present in his system 22 dc rebirth edit in 2016 dc comics implemented another relaunch of its books called dc rebirth which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to the new 52 basil is re imaged as a handsome young actor who was disfigured in a car accident in a desperate bid to salvage his career he began abusing an industrial make up chemical known as re nu which when combined with clay and putty warps flesh into new shapes and forms a secret he discovered from his father vincent karlo a former special effects artist however the chemical is long out of production and karlo is forced to steal more and more of it to preserve his handsome appearance batman apprehends him during one such robbery which reveals his secret to the world karlo s career is ruined and his girlfriend glory griffin dumps him batman attempts to get karlo to testify against the creator of re nu roland daggett but he refuses instead he attempts to break into the warehouse where the police are holding his stolen stash of re nu when police open fire on the vials karlo is doused in the chemical and transformed into clayface he then attacks the set of the film he was fired from batman attempts to evacuate the set but clayface flings him off into the distance and begins massacring everyone in sight as an added bit of revenge clayface disfigures glory who is working on the film as a production assistant before batman apprehends him 23 this incident leads glory to become mudface of the victim syndicate 24 in the 2016 batman story arc night of the monster

created by leaking serum 29 dr october offers to work on a means of returning clayface to human form permanently 30 she asks him to stay in his monstrous form for as long as possible so she can chart the mental degradation he undergoes the longer he remains nonhuman she also acts as his counselor when he despairs of a cure 29 dr october calls the clayface persona a fear response that occurs karlo s mind abandons empathy and embraces anger 31 batman has clayface wear a high technology forearm device later replaced with a smaller wristband with a longer lasting power source 32 that enables him to regain human form without using his powers reducing the psychotic effect being clayface has on karlo 33 the device is not a cure as the clayface dna consumes basil karlo s human dna whenever he is locked into human form 32 dr october gives him a placebo bracelet with messages from his close friend cassandra cain orphan which helps him focus on retaining his sanity after pushing past the twelve hour mark clayface loses his sanity and attacks dr october orphan intervenes saving her life by putting the real bracelet back on 34 victoria cares deeply for karlo 31 and later calls him a great friend 35 dr october expresses a desire to test her cure on a less serious case and karlo tells her of glory griffin 36 karlo also tells glory about the potential cure although she refuses to forgive

during his attack on old wayne tower karlo is accidentally doused with hundreds of gallons psychoactive mud worsening his insanity 31 b dr october attempts to cure karlo but the effect is only temporary 38 and batwoman kills karlo 38 three days later dr october cures glory griffin saying she did so only for the sake of basil karlo 35 clayface did not die however seven issues later in detective comics 981 readers discover that basil karlo is still alive and retains his clayface powers at least to some degree for reasons unstated dr october conspired with him to fake his death karlo leaves a message for cassandra cain and then allows dr october to take him out of gotham city 39 c in a flashback clayface is among the villains that protected ingrid karlsson during a riot before ingrid was killed by an inmate using a rogue batarang despite the villains getting her away from the riot she gave birth to astrid arkham who would later become the arkham knight 41 infinite frontier
