archery origins and ancient archery edit the oldest known evidence of the bow and arrow comes from south african sites such as sibudu cave where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads have been found dating approximately 72 000 to 60 000 years ago 4 5 6 7 8 9 based on indirect evidence the bow also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in eurasia near the transition from the upper paleolithic to the mesolithic the earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from europe are possible fragments from germany found at mannheim vogelstang dated 17 500 to 18 000 years ago and at stellmoor dated 11 000 years ago azilian points found in grotte du bichon switzerland alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter with flint fragments found in the bear s third vertebra suggest the use of arrows at 13 500 years ago 10 other signs of its use in europe come from the stellmoor de in the ahrensburg valley de north of hamburg germany and dates from the late paleolithic about 10 000 9000 bc the arrows were made of pine and consisted of a main shaft and a 15 20 centimetre long 5 7 8 7 7 8 in fore shaft with a flint point there are no definite earlier bows previous pointed shafts are known but may have been launched by spear throwers rather than bows the oldest bows known so far comes from the holmegård swamp in denmark at the site of nataruk in turkana county kenya obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton suggest the use of stone tipped arrows as weapons about 10 000 years ago 11 bows eventually replaced the spear thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles on every continent except australasia though spear throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the americas notably mexico and among the inuit bows and arrows have been present in egyptian and neighboring nubian culture since its respective predynastic and pre kerma origins in the levant artifacts that could be arrow shaft straighteners are known from the natufian culture c 10 800 8 300 bc onwards the khiamian and ppn a shouldered khiam points may well be arrowheads classical civilizations notably the assyrians greeks armenians persians parthians romans indians koreans chinese and japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies akkadians were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of naram sin of akkad 12 egyptians referred to nubia as ta seti or the land of the bow since the nubians were known to be expert archers and by the 16th century bc egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare 13 the bronze age aegean cultures were able to deploy a number of state owned specialized bow makers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the 15th century bc 14 the welsh longbow proved its worth for the first time in continental warfare at the battle of crécy 15 in the americas archery was widespread at european contact 16 archery was highly developed in asia the sanskrit term for archery dhanurveda came to refer to martial arts in general in east asia goguryeo one of the three kingdoms of korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers 17 18 medieval archery edit the medieval shortbow was technically identical with the classical era bows having a range of approximately one hundred yards 91 m it was the primary ranged weapon of the battlefield through the early medieval period around the tenth century the crossbow was introduced in europe crossbows generally had a longer range greater accuracy and more penetration than the shortbow but suffered from a much slower rate of fire crossbows were used in the early crusades with models having a range of 300 yards 270 m and being able to penetrate armour or kill a horse 19 during the late medieval period the english army famously relied on massed archers armed with the longbow the french army relied more on the crossbow 20 like their predecessors archers were more likely to be peasants or yeomen than men at arms the longbow had a range of up to 300 yards 270 m however its lack of accuracy at long ranges made it a mass weapon rather than an individual one significant victories attributable to the longbow such as the battle of crecy 21 and battle of agincourt resulted in the english longbow becoming part of military lore mounted archery edit main article mounted archery hunting for flying birds from the back of a galloping horse was considered the top category of archery the favourite hobby of prince maximilian engraved by dürer tribesmen of central asia after the domestication of the horse and american plains indians after gaining access to horses by europeans 22 became extremely adept at archery on horseback lightly armoured but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the central asian steppes and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of eurasia shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons 23 seljuk turks used mounted archers against the european first crusade especially at the battle of dorylaeum 1097 their tactic was to shoot at the enemy infantry and use their superior mobility to prevent the enemy from closing with them empires throughout the eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective barbarian counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow to the point where powerful states like the han dynasty referred to their neighbours the xiong nu as those who draw the bow 24 for example xiong nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the han military and their threat was at least partially responsible for chinese expansion into the ordos region to create a stronger more powerful buffer zone against them 24 it is possible that barbarian peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their civilized counterparts the xiong nu and the han being one example similarly short bows seem to have been introduced to japan by northeast asian groups 25 decline of archery edit the development of firearms rendered bows obsolete in warfare although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice in england and wales for example the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century 26 this was because it was recognized that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the hundred years war despite the high social status ongoing utility and widespread pleasure of archery in armenia china egypt england and wales the americas india japan korea turkey and elsewhere almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely to the neglect of archery early firearms were inferior in rate of fire and were very sensitive to wet weather however they had longer effective range 18 and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions they also required significantly less training to use properly in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield however the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon and archers have seen military action in the 21st century 27 28 29 traditional archery remains in use for sport and for hunting in many areas 18th century revival as a sport edit a print of the 1822 meeting of the royal british bowmen archery club early recreational archery societies included the finsbury archers and the ancient society of kilwinning archers the latter s annual papingo event was first recorded in 1483 in this event archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately 30 m or 33 yards above 30 the royal company of archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world 31 archery remained a small and scattered pastime however until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the aristocracy sir ashton lever an antiquarian and collector formed the toxophilite society in london in 1781 with the patronage of george the prince of wales archery societies were set up across the country each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility complete with flags music and 21 gun salutes for the competitors the clubs were the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class as well as its emphasis on display and status the sport was notable for its popularity with females young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so thus archery came to act as a forum for introductions flirtation and romance 32 it was often consciously styled in the manner of a medieval tournament with titles and laurel wreaths being presented as a reward to the victor general meetings were held from 1789 in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies archery was also co opted as a distinctively british tradition dating back to the lore of robin hood and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in europe the societies were also elitist and the new middle class bourgeoisie were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status after the napoleonic wars the sport became increasingly popular among all classes and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the preindustrial rural britain particularly influential was sir walter scott s 1819 novel ivanhoe that depicted the heroic character lockseley winning an archery tournament 33 an archery in the coat of arms of lieksa 34 based on the 1669 seal of the old town of brahea 35 a modern sport edit the 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport the first grand national archery society meeting was held in york in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardized as the york round a series of shoots at 60 yards 55 m 80 yards 73 m and 100 yards 91 m horace a ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques he won the grand national 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856 picture of saxton pope taken while grizzly hunting at yellowstone towards the end of the 19th century the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class by 1889 just 50 archery clubs were left in britain but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 paris olympics 36 the national archery association of the united states was organized in 1879 in part by maurice thompson 37 the author of the seminal text the witchery of archery and his brother will thompson maurice was president in its inaugural year and will was president in 1882 1903 and 1904 38 the 1910 president was frank e canfield 39 today it is known as usa archery and is recognized by united states olympic paralympic committee 40 in the united states primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century the last of the yahi indian tribe a native known as ishi came out of hiding in california in 1911 41 42 his doctor saxton pope learned many of ishi s traditional archery skills and popularized them 43 44 non primary source needed the pope and young club founded in 1961 and named in honor of pope and his friend arthur young became one of north america s leading bowhunting and conservation organizations founded as a nonprofit scientific organization the club was patterned after the prestigious boone and crockett club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality fair chase hunting and sound conservation

experts 45 they led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow these modern forms are now dominant in modern western archery traditional bows are in a minority archery returned to the olympics in 1972 in the 1980s the skills of traditional archery were revived by american enthusiasts and combined with the new scientific understanding much of this expertise is available in the traditional bowyer s bibles see further reading modern game archery owes much of its success to fred bear an american bow hunter and bow manufacturer 46 in 2021 five people were killed and three injured by an archer in norway in the kongsberg attack 47 mythology edit vishwamitra archery training from ramayana herakles the archer by émile antoine bourdelle deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers including the greek artemis and apollo the roman diana and cupid the germanic agilaz continuing in legends like those of wilhelm tell palnetoke or robin hood armenian hayk and babylonian marduk indian karna also known as radheya son of radha abhimanyu eklavya arjuna bhishma drona rama and shiva were known for their shooting skills the famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the mahabharata 48 persian arash was a famous archer earlier greek representations of heracles normally depict him as an archer archery and the bow play an important part in the epic poem the odyssey when odysseus returns home in disguise and then bests the suitors in an archery competition after hinting at his identity by stringing and drawing his great bow that only he can draw a similar motif is present in the turkic iranian heroic archeheroic poem alpamysh 49 the nymphai hyperboreioi νύμφαι ὑπερβόρειοι were worshipped on the greek island of delos as attendants of artemis presiding over aspects of archery hekaerge

features in many fictional forms jumong the first taewang of the goguryeo kingdom of the three kingdoms of korea is claimed by legend to have been a near godlike archer archery features in the story of oguz khagan similarly archery and the bow feature heavily into historical korean identity 52 in west african yoruba belief osoosi is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery equipment edit types of bows edit main article bow and arrow a pacific yew selfbow drawn by the split finger method selfbows are made from a single piece of wood while there is great variety in the construction details of bows both historic and modern all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string bows may be broadly split into two categories those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction notable examples being self bows laminated bows and composite bows bows can also be classified by the bow shape of the limbs when unstrung in contrast to traditional european straight bows a recurve bow and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung the cross section of the limb also varies the classic longbow is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are d shaped in cross section and the flatbow has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross section cable backed bows use cords as the back of the bow the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable they were widespread among inuit who lacked easy access to good bow wood one variety of cable backed bow is the penobscot bow or wabenaki bow invented by frank loring chief big thunder about 1900 53 it consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow in different cultures the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow in arab archery turkish archery and kyūdō the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow and this affects construction of the bow in western archery the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right handed archer modern takedown recurve bow compound bows are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this a typical let off is anywhere from 65 to 80 for example a 60 pound 27 kg bow with 80 let off only requires 12 pounds force 5 4 kgf 53 n to hold at full draw up to 99 let off is possible 54 the compound bow was invented by holless wilbur allen in the 1960s a us patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969 and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in north america mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting such as the crossbow crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows because of this heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow these mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn they are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as siege engines types of arrows and fletchings edit main article arrow the most common form of arrow consists of a shaft with an arrowhead at the front end and fletchings and a nock at the other end arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a quiver which can take many different forms shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid wood bamboo fiberglass aluminium alloy carbon fiber or composite materials wooden arrows are prone to warping fiberglass arrows are brittle but can be produced to uniform specifications easily aluminium shafts were a very popular high performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century due to their straightness lighter weight and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows today the most popular arrows at tournaments and olympic events are made of composite materials the arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft but separate arrowheads are far more common usually made from metal stone or other hard materials the most commonly used forms are target points field points and broadheads although there are also other types such as bodkin judo and blunt heads shield cut straight fletching here the hen feathers are barred red fletching is traditionally made from bird feathers but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet like spin vanes are used they are attached near the nock rear end of the arrow with thin double sided tape glue or traditionally sinew the most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches though as many as six have been used two makes the arrow unstable in flight when the arrow is three fletched the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string though variations are seen with modern equipment especially when using the modern spin vanes this fletch is called the index fletch or cock feather also known as the odd vane out or the nocking vane and the others are sometimes called the hen feathers commonly the cock feather is of a different color however if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material they may use same color vanes as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes resulting in less precision when an arrow is four fletched two opposing fletches are often cock feathers and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced the fletching may be either parabolic cut short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve or shield cut generally shaped like half of a narrow shield and is often attached at an angle known as helical fletching to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight whether helical or straight fletched when natural fletching bird feathers is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly these arrows are called flu flus misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow s flight path dramatically bowstring edit main article bowstring dacron and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows several modern methods of making a bowstring exist such as the endless loop and flemish twist almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring the author of arab archery suggests the hide of a young emaciated camel 55 njál s saga describes the refusal of a wife hallgerður to cut her hair to make an emergency bowstring for her husband gunnar hámundarson who is then killed protective equipment edit main articles bracer finger tab and thumb ring a right hand finger tab to protect the hand while the string is drawn most modern archers wear a bracer also known as an arm guard to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring the bracer does not brace the arm the word comes from the armoury term brassard meaning an armoured sleeve or badge the navajo people have developed highly ornamented bracers as non functional items of adornment 56 some archers nearly all female archers wear protection on their chests called chestguards or plastrons the myth of the amazons was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem 57 roger ascham mentions one archer presumably with an unusual shooting style who wore a leather guard for his face 58 the drawing digits are normally protected by a leather tab glove or thumb ring a simple tab of leather is commonly used as is a skeleton glove medieval europeans probably used a complete leather glove 59 eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or mongolian draw protected their thumbs usually with leather according to the author of arab archery 60 but also with special rings of various hard materials many surviving turkish and chinese examples are works of considerable art some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow possibly these were items of personal adornment and hence value remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time in traditional japanese archery a special glove is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string 61 release aids edit main article release aid release aid a release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow in the most commonly used the string is released by a finger operated trigger mechanism held in the archer s hand or attached to their wrist in another type known as a back tension release the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre determined tension stabilizers edit main article stabiliser archery stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow s balance stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow sights quivers rests and design of the riser the central non bending part of the bow make one side of the bow heavier one purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces a reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter in this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action a deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration these energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers gels powders and other materials used to build stabilizers stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of inertia while minimizing the weight added shooting technique and form edit historical reenactment of medieval archery chief master sgt kevin peterson demonstrates safe archery techniques while aiming an arrow at a target on the 28th force support squadron trap and skeet range at ellsworth air force base s d 11 october 2012 the standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance 62 one exception is in modern kyūdō where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand 63 therefore if one is right eye dominant they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand however not everyone agrees with this line of thought a smoother and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string either eye can be used for aiming and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use to assist with this an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye the hand that holds the bow is referred to as the bow hand and its arm the bow arm the opposite hand is called the drawing hand or string hand terms such as bow shoulder or string elbow follow the same convention if shooting according to eye dominance right eye dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand if shooting according to hand dexterity the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity regardless of eye dominance modern form edit to shoot an arrow an archer first assumes the correct stance the body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line with the feet placed shoulder width apart as an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the open stance or the closed stance may be used although many choose to stick with a neutral stance each archer has a particular preference but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot length from the other foot on the ground to load the bow is pointed toward the ground tipped slightly clockwise of vertical for a right handed shooter and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf the back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the nock a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow this step is called nocking the arrow typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane the cock feather is pointing away from the bow to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest a compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest known as a launcher and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather vane pointed either up or down depending upon the type of launcher being used the bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers or with a mechanical arrow release most commonly for finger shooters the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below although several other techniques have their adherents around the world involving three fingers below the arrow or an arrow pinching technique instinctive shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers shooters of longbows and recurves in either the split finger or three finger under case the string is usually placed in the first or second joint or else on the pads of the fingers when using a mechanical release aid the release is hooked onto the d loop 64 another type of string hold used on traditional bows is the type favoured by the mongol warriors known as the thumb release style this involves using the thumb to draw the string with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support to release the string the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb when using this type of release the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i e left hand draw arrow on left side of bow the archer then raises the bow and draws the string with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions this is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows which tend to vary from archer to archer compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback at around the last 1 1 2 inches 4 cm where the draw weight is at its maximum before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position the archer draws the string hand towards the face where it should rest lightly at a fixed anchor point this point is consistent from shot to shot and is usually at the corner of the mouth on the chin to the cheek or to the ear depending on preferred shooting style the archer holds the bow arm outwards toward the target the elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground as exemplified by the korean archer jang yong ho this keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring in modern form the archer stands erect forming a t the archer s lower trapezius muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device called a clicker which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length in contrast traditional english longbow shooters step into the bow exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously especially when using bows having draw weights from 100 lb 45 kg to over 175 lb 80 kg heavily stacked traditional bows recurves long bows and the like are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last 1 1 2 inches 4 cm dropping holding weight significantly at full draw compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy the arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand see bow draw or triggering the mechanical release aid usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid the bow hand relaxed and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles as opposed to using just arm motions an archer should also pay attention to the recoil or follow through of his or her body as it may indicate problems with form technique that affect accuracy aiming methods edit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced

sight or barebow mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming they can be as simple as a pin or may use optics with magnification they usually also have a peep sight rear sight built into the string which aids in a consistent anchor point modern compound 65 bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent barebow archers often use a sight picture which includes the target the bow the hand the arrow shaft and the arrow tip as seen at the same time by the archer with a fixed anchor point where the string is brought to or close to the face and a fully extended bow arm successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same point this lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy modern archery equipment usually includes sights instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows the two most common forms of a non mechanical release are split finger and three under split finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below three under aiming places the index middle and ring fingers under the nocked arrow this technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye and is commonly called gun barreling referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms when using short bows or shooting from horseback it is difficult to use the sight picture the archer may look at the target but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view aiming then involves hand eye coordination which includes proprioception and motor muscle memory similar to that used when throwing a ball with sufficient practice such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war 66 aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting not however increasing accuracy instinctive shooting is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind proprioception and motor muscle memory to make aiming adjustments the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight

projectile is thrown by hand the speed of the projectile is determined by the kinetic energy imparted by the thrower s muscles performing work however the energy must be imparted over a limited distance determined by arm length and therefore because the projectile is accelerating over a limited time so the limiting factor is not work but rather power which determines how much energy can be added in the limited time available power generated by muscles however is limited by force velocity relationship and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds resulting in less than 1 4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force velocity relationship when a bow is used the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly resulting in greater force and greater work done this work is stored in the bow as elastic potential energy and when the bowstring is released this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles resulting in much higher velocity and hence greater distance this same process is employed by frogs which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance in archery some energy dissipates through elastic hysteresis reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot of the remaining energy some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring depending on the arrow s elasticity some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft causing it to flex out to one side this is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer s fingers can open and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string and hence arrow nock as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism this makes the arrow oscillate in flight its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly gradually reducing as the arrow s flight proceeds this is clearly visible in high speed photography of arrows at discharge a direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when dry firing dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy almost all the energy stays in the bow some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow such as cracks and fractures and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces should never be done 68 snake indians testing bows circa 1837 by alfred jacob miller the walters art museum modern arrows are made to a specified spine or stiffness rating to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim this flexing can be a desirable feature since when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow string the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow rest and consequently the arrow and fletchings have an un impeded flight this feature is known as the archer s paradox it maintains accuracy for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge some inconsistency would be present and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved the accurate flight of an arrow depends on its fletchings the arrow s manufacturer a fletcher can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis this improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to plane on the air in a random direction after shooting even with a carefully made arrow the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow consequently rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence which overall maintains the intended direction of flight i e accuracy this rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel the innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow the huge ratio of length vs cross sectional area coupled with velocity made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented arrows can spread or concentrate force depending on the application practice arrows for instance have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration arrows designed to pierce armor in the middle ages used a very narrow and sharp tip bodkinhead to concentrate the force arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip broadhead that widens further to facilitate both penetration and a large wound further information archer s paradox hunting edit main article bow hunting a modern compound hunting bow using archery to take game animals is known as bow hunting bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill the skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey whether by still hunting stalking or waiting in a blind or tree stand in many countries including much of the united states bow hunting for large and small game is legal bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder shotgun or rifle usually compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow these compound bows may feature fiber optic sights stabilizers and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as bow fishing modern competitive

fever also referred to as pyrexia is defined as having a temperature above the normal range due to an increase in the body s temperature set point 5 6 12 7 there is not a single agreed upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between 37 2 and 38 3 c 99 0 and 100 9 f in humans 1 7 8 the increase in set point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold or chills 2 this results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat 3 when the set point temperature returns to normal a person feels hot becomes flushed and may begin to sweat 3 rarely a fever may trigger a febrile seizure with this being more common in young children 4 fevers do not typically go higher than 41 to 42 c 106 to 108 f 6 a fever can be caused by many medical conditions ranging from non serious to life threatening 13 this includes viral bacterial and parasitic infections such as influenza the common cold meningitis urinary tract infections appendicitis lassa covid 19 and malaria 13 14 non infectious causes include vasculitis deep vein thrombosis connective tissue disease side effects of medication or vaccination and cancer 13 15 it differs from hyperthermia in that hyperthermia is an increase in body temperature over the temperature set point due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss 1 treatment to reduce fever is generally not required 2 9 treatment of associated pain and inflammation however may be useful and help a person rest 9 medications such as ibuprofen or paracetamol acetaminophen may help with this as well as lower temperature 9 10 children younger than three months require medical attention as might people with serious medical problems such as a compromised immune system or people with other symptoms 16 hyperthermia requires treatment 2 fever is one of the most common medical signs 2 it is part of about 30 of healthcare visits by children 2 and occurs in up to 75 of adults who are seriously sick 11 while fever evolved as a defense mechanism treating a fever does not appear to improve or worsen outcomes 17 18 19 fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than is usually deserved a phenomenon known as fever phobia 2 20 contents 1 associated symptoms 2 diagnosis 2 1 hyperthermia 3 types 3 1 hyperpyrexia 4 differential diagnosis

which consists of lethargy depression loss of appetite sleepiness hyperalgesia dehydration 21 22 and the inability to concentrate sleeping with a fever can often cause intense or confusing nightmares commonly called fever dreams 23 mild to severe delirium which can also cause hallucinations may also present itself during high fevers 24 diagnosis edit temperature classification core rectal

normal temperatures has been found 8 central temperatures such as rectal temperatures are more accurate than peripheral temperatures 30 fever is generally agreed to be present if the elevated temperature 31 is caused by a raised set point and temperature in the anus rectum rectal is at or over 37 5 38 3 c 99 5 100 9 f 1 8 an ear tympanic or forehead temporal temperature may also be used 32 33 temperature in the mouth oral is at or over 37 2 c 99 0 f in the morning or over 37 7 c 99 9 f in the afternoon 7 34 temperature under the arm axillary is usually about 0 6 c 1 1 f below core body temperature 35 in adults the normal range of oral temperatures in healthy individuals is 35 7 37 7 c 96 3 99 9 f among men and 33 2 38 1 c 91 8 100 6 f among women while when taken rectally it is 36 7 37 5 c 98 1 99 5 f among men and 36 8 37 1 c 98 2 98 8 f among women and for ear measurement it is 35 5 37 5 c 95 9 99 5 f among men and 35 7 37 5 c 96 3 99 5 f among women 36 normal body temperatures vary depending on many factors including age sex time of day ambient temperature activity level and more 37 38 normal daily temperature variation has been described as 0 5 c 0 9 f 7 4012 a raised temperature is not always a fever 37 for example the temperature rises in healthy people when they exercise but this is not considered a fever as the set point is normal 37 on the other hand a normal temperature may be a fever if it is unusually high for that person for example medically frail elderly people have a decreased ability to generate body heat so a normal temperature of 37 3 c 99 1 f may represent a clinically significant fever 37 hyperthermia edit hyperthermia is an elevation of body temperature over the temperature set point due to either too much heat production or not enough heat loss 1 7 hyperthermia is thus not considered fever 7 103 39 hyperthermia is not to be confused with hyperpyrexia which is a very high fever 7 102 clinically it is important to distinguish between fever and hyperthermia as hyperthermia may quickly lead to death and does not respond to antipyretic medications the distinction may however be difficult to make in an emergency setting and is often established by identifying possible causes 7 103 types edit different fever patterns observed in plasmodium infections various patterns of measured patient temperatures have been observed some of which may be indicative of a particular medical diagnosis continuous fever where temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than 1 c in 24 hours 40 e g in bacterial pneumonia typhoid infective endocarditis tuberculosis or typhus 41 42 intermittent fever where the temperature elevation is present only for a certain period later cycling back to normal e g in malaria leishmaniasis pyemia sepsis 43 or african trypanosomiasis 44 remittent fever where the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 c in 24 hours 45 e g in infective endocarditis or brucellosis 46 pel ebstein fever is a cyclic fever that is rarely seen in patients with hodgkin s lymphoma undulant fever seen in brucellosis typhoid fever is an example of continuous fever and it shows a characteristic step ladder pattern a step wise increase in temperature with a high plateau 47 among the types of intermittent fever are ones specific to cases of malaria caused by different pathogens these are 48 49 quotidian fever with a 24 hour periodicity typical of malaria caused by plasmodium knowlesi p knowlesi 50 51 tertian fever with a 48 hour periodicity typical of later course malaria caused by p falciparum p vivax or p ovale 48 quartan fever with a 72 hour periodicity typical of later course malaria caused by p malariae 48 in addition there is disagreement regarding whether a specific fever pattern is associated with hodgkin s lymphoma the pel ebstein fever with patients argued to present high temperature for one week followed by low for the next week and so on where the generality of this pattern is debated 52 53 persistent fever that cannot be explained after repeated routine clinical inquiries is called fever of unknown origin 7 54 a neutropenic fever also called febrile neutropenia is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function 55 because of the lack of infection fighting neutrophils a bacterial infection can spread rapidly this fever is therefore usually considered to require urgent medical attention 56 this kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people 55 57 hyperpyrexia edit hyperpyrexia is an extreme elevation of body temperature which depending upon the source is classified as a core body temperature greater than or equal to 40 or 41 c 104 or 106 f the range of hyperpyrexias includes cases considered severe 40 c and extreme 42 c 7 58 59 it differs from hyperthermia in that one s thermoregulatory system s set point for body temperature is set above normal then heat is generated to achieve it in contrast hyperthermia involves body temperature rising above its set point due to outside factors 7 60 the high temperatures of hyperpyrexia are considered medical emergencies as they may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to severe morbidity including permanent brain damage or to death 61 a common cause of hyperpyrexia is an intracranial hemorrhage 7 other causes in emergency room settings include sepsis kawasaki syndrome 62 neuroleptic malignant syndrome drug overdose serotonin

viewing fever from an organismal and evolutionary perspective note the value to an organism of having a fever response in particular in response to infective disease 17 77 78 on the other hand while fever evolved as a defense mechanism studies have not been consistent on whether treating fever generally worsens or improves mortality risk in a modern clinical setting 17 18 79 80 81 benefits or harms may depend on the type of infection health status of the patient and other factors 17 79 80 81 studies using warm blooded vertebrates suggest that they recover more rapidly from infections or critical illness due to fever 82 other studies suggest reduced mortality in bacterial infections when fever was present 83 fever is thought to contribute to host defense 17 as the reproduction of pathogens with strict temperature requirements can be hindered and the rates of some important immunological reactions clarification needed are increased by temperature 84 fever has been described in teaching texts as assisting the healing process in various ways including increased mobility of leukocytes 85 1044 verification needed enhanced leukocyte phagocytosis 85 1044 verification needed

humans hypothalamus edit temperature is regulated in the hypothalamus the trigger of a fever called a pyrogen results in the release of prostaglandin e2 pge2 pge2 in turn acts on the hypothalamus which creates a systemic response in the body causing heat generating effects to match a new higher temperature set point there are four receptors in which pge2 can bind ep1 4 with a previous study showing the ep3 subtype is what mediates the fever response 87 hence the hypothalamus can be seen as working like a thermostat 7 when the set point is raised the body increases its temperature through both active generation of heat and retention of heat peripheral vasoconstriction both reduces heat loss through the skin and causes the person to feel cold norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and muscle contraction through shivering raises the metabolic rate 88 if these measures are insufficient to make the blood temperature in the brain match the new set point in the hypothalamus the brain orchestrates heat effector mechanisms via the autonomic nervous system or primary motor center for shivering these may be citation needed increased heat production by increased muscle tone shivering muscle movements to produce heat and release of hormones like epinephrine and prevention of heat loss e g through vasoconstriction when the hypothalamic set point moves back to baseline either spontaneously or via medication normal functions such as sweating and the reverse of the foregoing processes e g vasodilation end of shivering and nonshivering heat production are used to cool the body to the new lower setting citation needed this contrasts with hyperthermia in which the normal setting remains and the body overheats through undesirable retention of excess heat or over production of heat hyperthermia is usually the result of an excessively hot environment heat stroke or an adverse reaction to drugs fever can be differentiated from hyperthermia by the circumstances surrounding it and its response to anti pyretic medications 7 verification needed in infants the autonomic nervous system may also activate brown adipose tissue to produce heat non exercise associated thermogenesis also known as non shivering thermogenesis citation needed increased heart rate and vasoconstriction contribute to increased blood pressure in fever citation needed pyrogens edit a pyrogen is a substance that induces fever 89 in the presence of an infectious agent such as bacteria viruses viroids etc the immune response of the body is to inhibit their growth and eliminate them the most common pyrogens are endotoxins which are lipopolysaccharides lps produced by gram negative bacteria such as e coli but pyrogens include non endotoxic substances derived from microorganisms other than gram negative bacteria or from chemical substances as well 90 the types of pyrogens include internal endogenous and external exogenous to the body citation needed the pyrogenicity of given pyrogens varies in extreme cases bacterial pyrogens can act as superantigens and cause rapid and dangerous fevers 91 endogenous edit endogenous pyrogens are cytokines released from monocytes which are part of the immune system 92 in general they stimulate chemical responses often in the presence of an antigen leading to a fever whilst they can be a product of external factors like exogenous pyrogens they can also be induced by internal factors like damage associated molecular patterns such as cases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus 93 major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 α and β 94 1237 1248 and interleukin 6 il 6 95 minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin 8 tumor necrosis factor β macrophage inflammatory protein α and macrophage inflammatory protein β as well as interferon α interferon β and interferon γ 94 1237 1248 tumor necrosis factor α tnf also acts as a pyrogen mediated by interleukin 1 il 1 release 96 these cytokine factors are released into general circulation where they migrate to the brain s circumventricular organs where they are more easily absorbed than in areas protected by the blood brain barrier citation needed the cytokines then bind to endothelial receptors on vessel walls to receptors on microglial cells resulting in activation of the arachidonic acid pathway citation needed of these il 1β tnf and il 6 are able to raise the temperature setpoint of an organism and cause fever these proteins produce a cyclooxygenase which induces the hypothalamic production of pge2 which then stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate and increases body temperature 97 exogenous edit exogenous pyrogens are external to the body and are of microbial origin in general these pyrogens including bacterial cell wall products may act on toll like receptors in the hypothalamus and elevate the thermoregulatory setpoint 98 an example of a class of exogenous pyrogens are bacterial lipopolysaccharides lps present in the cell wall of gram negative bacteria according to one mechanism of pyrogen action an immune system protein lipopolysaccharide binding protein lbp binds to lps and the lbp lps complex then binds to a cd14 receptor on a macrophage the lbp lps binding to cd14 results in cellular synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokines e g interleukin 1 il 1 interleukin 6 il 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfα a further downstream event is activation of the arachidonic acid pathway 99 pge2 release edit pge2 release comes from the arachidonic acid pathway this pathway as it relates to fever is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase a2 pla2 cyclooxygenase 2 cox 2 and prostaglandin e2 synthase these enzymes ultimately mediate the synthesis and release of pge2 citation needed pge2 is the ultimate mediator of the febrile response the setpoint temperature of the body will remain elevated until pge2 is no longer present pge2 acts on neurons in the preoptic area poa through the prostaglandin e receptor 3 ep3 ep3 expressing neurons in the poa innervate the dorsomedial hypothalamus dmh the rostral raphe pallidus nucleus in the medulla oblongata rrpa and the paraventricular nucleus pvn of the hypothalamus fever signals sent to the dmh and rrpa lead to stimulation of the sympathetic output system which evokes non shivering thermogenesis to produce body heat and skin vasoconstriction to decrease heat loss from the body surface it is presumed that the innervation from the poa to the pvn mediates the neuroendocrine effects of fever through the pathway involving pituitary gland and various endocrine organs citation needed management edit fever does not necessarily need to be treated 100 and most people with a fever recover without specific medical attention 101 although it is unpleasant fever rarely rises to a dangerous level even if untreated 102 damage to the brain generally does not occur until temperatures reach 42 0 c 107 6 f and it is rare for an untreated fever to exceed 40 6 c 105 1 f 103 treating fever in people with sepsis does not affect outcomes 104 small trials have shown no benefit of treating fevers of 38 5 c 101 3 f or higher of critical ill patients in icus and one trial was terminated early because patients receiving aggressive fever treatment were dying more often 19 according to the nih the two assumptions which are generally used to argue in favor of treating fevers have not been experimentally validated these are that 1 a fever is noxious and 2 suppression of a fever will reduce its noxious effect most of the other studies supporting the association of fever with poorer outcomes have been observational in nature in theory these critically ill patients and those faced with additional physiologic stress may benefit from fever reduction but the evidence on both sides of the argument appears to be mostly equivocal 19 conservative measures edit limited evidence supports sponging or bathing feverish children with tepid water 105 the use of a fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort if the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia aggressive cooling is required generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water 61 in general people are advised to keep adequately hydrated 106 whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known 107 medications edit medications that lower fevers are called antipyretics 108 the antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fevers in children 109 it is more effective than acetaminophen paracetamol in children 109 ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be safely used together in children with fevers 110 111 the efficacy of acetaminophen by itself in children with fevers has been questioned 112 ibuprofen is also superior to aspirin in children with fevers 113 additionally aspirin is not recommended in children and young adults those under the age of 16 or 19 depending on the country due to the risk of reye s syndrome 114 using both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time or alternating between the two is more effective at decreasing fever than using only paracetamol or ibuprofen 115 it is not clear if it increases child comfort 115 response or nonresponse to medications does not predict whether or not a child has a serious illness 116 with respect to the effect of antipyretics on the risk of death in those with infection studies have found mixed results as of 2019 117 animal models have found worsened outcomes with the use of antipyretics in influenza as of 2010 but they have not been studied for this use in humans 118 epidemiology edit fever is one of the most common medical signs 2 it is part of about 30 of healthcare visits by children 2 and occurs in up to 75 of adults who are seriously sick 11 about 5 of people who go to an emergency room have a fever 119 history edit a number of types of fever were known as early as 460 bc to 370 bc when hippocrates was practicing medicine including that due to malaria tertian or every 2 days and quartan or every 3 days 120 it also became clear around this time that fever was a symptom of disease rather than a disease in and of itself 120 infections presenting with fever were a major source of mortality in humans for about 200 000 years until the late nineteenth century approximately half of all humans died from infections before the age of fifteen 121 an older term febricula a diminutive form of the latin word for fever was once used to refer to a low grade fever lasting only a few days this term fell out of use in the early 20th century and the symptoms it referred to are now thought to have been caused mainly by various minor viral respiratory infections 122 society and culture edit mythology edit febris febris fever in latin is the goddess of fever and malaria in roman mythology people with fevers would visit her temples jvarasura fever demon in hindi is the god of fever and disease in hindu and buddhist mythology paediatrics edit fever is often viewed with greater concern by parents and healthcare professionals than might be deserved a phenomenon known as fever phobia 2 123 which is based in both caregiver s and parents misconceptions about fever in children among them many parents incorrectly believe that fever is a disease rather than a medical sign that even low fevers are harmful and that any temperature even briefly or slightly above the oversimplified normal number marked on a thermometer is a clinically significant fever 123 they are also afraid of harmless side effects like febrile seizures and dramatically overestimate the likelihood of permanent damage from typical fevers 123 the underlying problem according to professor of pediatrics barton d schmitt is that as parents we tend to suspect that our children s brains may melt 124 as a result of these misconceptions parents are anxious give the child fever reducing medicine when the temperature is technically normal or only slightly elevated and interfere with the child s sleep to give the child more medicine 123 other species edit main article thermoregulation fever is an important metric for the diagnosis of disease in domestic animals the body temperature of animals which is taken rectally is different from one species to another for example a horse is said to have a fever above 101 f 38 3 c 125 in species that allow the body to have a wide range of normal temperatures such as camels 126 whose body temperature varies as the environmental temperature varies 127 the body temperature which constitutes a febrile state differs depending on the environmental temperature 128 fever can also be behaviorally induced by invertebrates that do not have immune system based fever for instance some species of grasshopper will thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures that are 2 5 c higher than normal in order to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens such as beauveria bassiana and metarhizium acridum 129 honeybee colonies are also able to induce a fever in response to a fungal parasite ascosphaera apis 129 references edit a b c d e f g h i axelrod yk diringer mn may 2008 temperature

is a fictional character a dc comics supervillain he has also been known to be called the forever soldier or the forever general 1 contents 1 publication history 2 fictional character biography 3 powers and abilities 4 in other media 4 1 television 4 2 miscellaneous 5 references 6 external links publication history edit he first appeared in my greatest adventure 80 the first story in the doom patrol series and was created by arnold drake bob haney bruno premiani and murray boltinoff 2 fictional character biography edit general immortus is perhaps centuries old and his origins are shrouded in mystery 3 at some points it has even been implied that immortus origins lie in ancient history he once owned a diamond mine the source of much of his current day wealth and he killed many of the slave workers to keep the location a secret 4 which even remains today however little beyond this information has ever been revealed about immortus past his real name has never been revealed nor his country of origin although it is implied to be somewhere in europe until coming into contact with the doom patrol immortus had sustained his unnatural long life indefinitely with a highly secretive and life extending alchemical potion but immortus eventually lost the precious formula and was unable to reproduce it and as his previous stocks began to run out he began to once again age this time rapidly immortus hired a young scientist named niles caulder to recreate the potion when caulder discovered immortus s identity and plan he sabotaged the life extending ray that he had been developing 1 caulder as the chief later formed the doom patrol specifically to combat one of immortus later schemes 5 thereafter most of general immortus schemes were to sustain his longevity by finding a substitute for the elixir of life he had lost thus he funded and became the leader of a highly secretive criminal syndicate to steal ancient tomes and mystical artifacts for the purpose of sustaining immortus unnatural long life this syndicate is militaristic hence immortus title of general and not unlike the thule society in its philosophy and dabbling in the occult from time to time thereafter immortus sparred with the doom patrol usually in an effort to obtain the results of the chief s life extension research or the doom patrol intercepted immortus as he attempted to steal ancient mystical artifacts immortus was a one time member of the brotherhood of evil a group formed largely to combat the doom patrol a second doom patrol was initiated by an indian woman named arani claiming to be mrs niles caulder and calling herself celsius in showcase 95 the general submitted her to a mind scan to find the secret to immortality and managed to become young for the briefest moment on his moon base until the doom patrol got free and started to destroy the base as he began regressing to his former senescence it turned out the immortality treatment failed because it had been prepared specifically for arani s physiology 1 in 2004 dc writer john byrne restarted the doom patrol series and declared that the previous history had never happened though this revision did not tamper with the history of all its villains since their history had also been chronicled in various teen titans books since infinite crisis all doom patrol continuity byrne attempted to wipe out is now largely restored including that of general immortus he was seen in salvation run where he was killed by parademons in the final issue immortus reappeared alive and well in final crisis aftermath run 2 and referred to the events of salvation run as having been an eye opening experience for him he is now recruiting followers into his army of the endangered general immortus has professor milo operate upon them to give them powers including established non powered villains sportsmaster mr polka dot condiment king and the human flame as well as new villains brown recluse miss army knife n emy phoney baloney and seductress he ensures that use of these abilities causes pain until the villains have proved themselves unconditionally 6 the human flame however is able to overcome both the pain and an additional failsafe installed by professor milo a wireless remote wired to his implants and granting to immortus and milo the ability to shut down his powers at will grievously burning immortus with his powers and killing all of his new followers save for his lover seductress who stays at his side 7 as the human flame goes away in a quest for gaining new powers a wounded immortus asks milo to rethink their strategy 8 powers and abilities edit immortus is a cunning criminal mastermind and has lived for centuries as a result of his life extending potion in other media edit television edit general immortus appears in teen titans voiced by xander berkeley he appears much older than he was in the comic books there are scenes of immortus commanding troops in various battles going back to phaeronic egypt and upon quoting the art of war immortus claims that sun tzu was one of his best students he is a master tactician as a result of his millennia of combat experience in virtually every major world conflict his uniform and the uniforms of his foot soldiers resemble those of the wehrmacht implying that he may have been a nazi party member while his overall appearance is similar to karl dönitz it is not clear if the animated series immortus is actually immortal or has just been using his life extending potion for thousands of years immortus commanded his robots to bring in argent during the final battle in titans together he and his army was washed away by aqualad and tramm and were soon flash frozen general immortus appears in the doom patrol segments of dc nation shorts voiced by clancy brown miscellaneous edit general immortus appears in teen titans go 32 later in issue 35 with private h i v e as his temporary foot soldier and a robot army of sladebots as his followers he attempts to infiltrate titans tower and use their giant defense robot against them betraying private h i v e in the process but is quickly defeated general immortus appears in the sixth issue of batman the brave and the bold s tie in comic he uses a stolen time machine to summon various soldiers from the past only for them to rebel against his command after batman and kid eternity team up to stop them immortus returns having obtained the spear of destiny from history but is defeated when kid eternity gets around the spear s no man of woman born clause by summoning g i robot

rotates about its center the direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball according to the right hand rule while its length is twice the ball s angular velocity mathematically the vorticity is defined as the curl or rotational of the velocity field of the fluid usually denoted by ω displaystyle vec omega and expressed by the vector analysis formula u displaystyle nabla times vec mathit u where displaystyle nabla is the nabla operator and u displaystyle vec mathit u is the local flow velocity 5 the local rotation measured by the vorticity ω displaystyle vec omega must not be confused with the angular velocity vector of that portion of the fluid with respect to the external environment or to any fixed axis in a vortex in particular ω displaystyle vec omega may be opposite to the mean angular velocity vector of the fluid relative to the vortex s axis vortex types edit in theory the speed u of the particles and therefore the vorticity in a vortex may vary with the distance r from the axis in many ways there are two important special cases however a rigid body vortex if the fluid rotates like a rigid body that is if the angular rotational velocity ω is uniform so that u increases proportionally to the distance r from the axis a tiny ball carried by the flow would also rotate about its center as if it were part of that rigid body in such a flow the vorticity is the same everywhere its direction is parallel to the rotation axis and its magnitude is equal to twice the uniform angular velocity ω of the fluid around the center of rotation ω 0 0 ω r x y 0 displaystyle vec omega 0 0 omega quad vec r x y 0 u ω r ω y ω x 0 displaystyle vec u vec omega times vec r omega y omega x 0 ω u 0 0 2 ω 2 ω displaystyle vec omega nabla times vec u 0 0 2 omega 2 vec omega an irrotational vortex if the particle speed u is inversely proportional to the distance r from the axis then the imaginary test ball would not rotate over itself it would maintain the same orientation while moving in a circle around the vortex axis in this case the vorticity ω displaystyle vec omega is zero at any point not on that axis and the flow is said to be irrotational ω 0 0 α r 2 r x y 0 displaystyle vec omega 0 0 alpha r 2 quad vec r x y 0 u ω r α y r 2 α x r 2 0 displaystyle vec u vec omega times vec r alpha yr 2 alpha

of external forces a vortex usually evolves fairly quickly toward the irrotational flow pattern citation needed where the flow velocity u is inversely proportional to the distance r irrotational vortices are also called free vortices for an irrotational vortex the circulation is zero along any closed contour that does not enclose the vortex axis and has a fixed value γ for any contour that does enclose the axis once 6 the tangential component of the particle velocity is then u θ γ 2 π r displaystyle u_ theta tfrac gamma 2 pi r the angular momentum per unit mass relative to the vortex axis is therefore constant r u θ γ 2 π displaystyle ru_ theta tfrac gamma 2 pi the ideal irrotational vortex flow in free space is not physically realizable since it would imply that the particle speed and hence the force needed to keep particles in their circular paths would grow without bound as one approaches the vortex axis indeed in real vortices there is always a core region surrounding the axis where the particle velocity stops increasing and then decreases to zero as r goes to zero within that region the flow is no longer irrotational the vorticity ω displaystyle vec omega becomes non zero with direction roughly parallel to the vortex axis the rankine vortex is a model that assumes a rigid body rotational flow where r is less than a fixed distance r0 and irrotational flow outside that core regions in a viscous fluid irrotational flow contains viscous dissipation everywhere yet there are no net viscous forces only viscous stresses 7 due to the dissipation this means that sustaining an irrotational viscous vortex requires continuous input of work at the core for example by steadily turning a cylinder at the core in free space there is no energy input at the core and thus the compact vorticity held in the core will naturally diffuse outwards converting the core to a gradually slowing and gradually growing rigid body flow surrounded by the original irrotational flow such a decaying irrotational vortex has an exact solution of the viscous navier stokes equations known as a lamb oseen vortex rotational vortices edit saturn s north polar vortex a rotational vortex a vortex that rotates in the same way as a rigid body cannot exist indefinitely in that state except through the application of some extra force that is not generated by the fluid motion itself it has non zero vorticity everywhere outside the core rotational vortices are also called rigid body vortices or forced vortices for example if a water bucket is spun at constant angular speed w about its vertical axis the water will eventually rotate in rigid body fashion the particles will then move along circles with velocity u equal to wr 6 in that case the free surface of the water will assume a parabolic shape in this situation the rigid rotating enclosure provides an extra force namely an extra pressure gradient in the water directed inwards that prevents transition of the rigid body flow to the irrotational state vortex formation on boundaries edit vortex structures are defined by their vorticity the local rotation rate of fluid particles they can be formed via the phenomenon known as boundary layer separation which can occur when a fluid moves over a surface and experiences a rapid acceleration from the fluid velocity to zero due to the no slip condition this rapid negative acceleration creates a boundary layer which causes a local rotation of fluid at the wall i e vorticity which is referred to as the wall shear rate the thickness of this boundary layer is proportional to v t displaystyle surd vt where v is the free stream fluid velocity and t is time if the diameter or thickness of the vessel or fluid is less than the boundary layer thickness then the boundary layer will not separate and vortices will not form however when the boundary layer does grow beyond this critical boundary layer thickness then separation will occur which will generate vortices this boundary layer separation can also occur in the presence of combatting pressure gradients i e a pressure that develops downstream this is present in curved surfaces and general geometry changes like a convex surface a unique example of severe geometric changes is at the trailing edge of a bluff body where the fluid flow deceleration and therefore boundary layer and vortex formation is located another form of vortex formation on a boundary is when fluid flows perpendicularly into a wall and creates a splash effect the velocity streamlines are immediately deflected and decelerated so that the boundary layer separates and forms a toroidal vortex ring 8 vortex geometry edit in a stationary vortex the typical streamline a line that is everywhere tangent to the flow velocity vector is a closed loop surrounding the axis and each vortex line a line that is everywhere tangent to the vorticity vector is roughly parallel to the axis a surface that is everywhere tangent to both flow velocity and vorticity is called a vortex tube in general vortex tubes are nested around the axis of rotation the axis itself is one of the vortex lines a limiting case of a vortex tube with zero diameter according to helmholtz s theorems a vortex line cannot start or end in the fluid except momentarily in non steady flow while the vortex is forming or dissipating in general vortex lines in particular the axis line are either closed loops or end at the boundary of the fluid a whirlpool is an example of the latter namely a vortex in a body of water whose axis ends at the free surface a vortex tube whose vortex lines are all closed will be a closed torus like surface a newly created vortex will promptly extend and bend so as to eliminate any open ended vortex lines for example when an airplane engine is started a vortex usually forms ahead of each propeller or the turbofan of each jet engine one end of the vortex line is attached to the engine while the other end usually stretches out and bends until it reaches the ground when vortices are made visible by smoke or ink trails they may seem to have spiral pathlines or streamlines however this appearance is often an illusion and the fluid particles are moving in closed paths the spiral streaks that are taken to be streamlines are in fact clouds of the marker fluid that originally spanned several vortex tubes and were stretched into spiral shapes by the non uniform flow velocity distribution pressure in a vortex edit a plughole vortex the fluid motion in a vortex creates a dynamic pressure in addition to any hydrostatic pressure that is lowest in the core region closest to the axis and increases as one moves away from it in accordance with bernoulli s principle one can say that it is the gradient of this pressure that forces the fluid to follow a curved path around the axis in a rigid body vortex flow of a fluid with constant density the dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the distance r from the axis in a constant gravity field the free surface of the liquid if present is a concave paraboloid in an irrotational vortex flow with constant fluid density and cylindrical symmetry the dynamic pressure varies as p k r2 where p is the limiting pressure infinitely far from the axis this formula provides another constraint for the extent of the core since the pressure cannot be negative the free surface if present dips sharply near the axis line with depth inversely proportional to r2 the shape formed by the free surface is called a hyperboloid or gabriel s horn by evangelista torricelli the core of a vortex in air is sometimes visible because water vapor condenses as the low pressure of the core causes adiabatic cooling the funnel of a tornado is an example when a vortex line ends at a boundary surface the reduced pressure may also draw matter from that surface into the core for example a dust devil is a column of dust picked up by the core of an air vortex attached to the ground a vortex that ends at the free surface of a body of water like the whirlpool that often forms over a bathtub drain may draw a column of air down the core the forward vortex extending from a jet engine of a parked airplane can suck water and small stones into the core and then into the engine evolution edit vortices need not be steady state features they can move and change shape in a moving vortex the particle paths are not closed but are open loopy curves like helices and cycloids a vortex flow might also be combined with a radial or axial flow pattern in that case the streamlines and pathlines are not closed curves but spirals or helices respectively this is the case in tornadoes and in drain whirlpools a vortex with helical streamlines is said to be solenoidal as long as the effects of viscosity and diffusion are negligible the fluid in a moving vortex is carried along with it in particular the fluid in the core and matter trapped by it tends to remain in the core as the vortex moves about this is a consequence of helmholtz s second theorem thus vortices unlike surface waves and pressure waves can transport mass energy and momentum over considerable distances compared to their size with surprisingly little dispersion this effect is demonstrated by smoke rings and exploited in vortex ring toys and guns two or more vortices that are approximately parallel and circulating in the same direction will attract and eventually merge to form a single vortex whose circulation will equal the sum of the circulations of the constituent vortices for example an airplane wing that is developing lift will create a sheet of small vortices at its trailing edge these small vortices merge to form a single wingtip vortex less than one wing chord downstream of that edge this phenomenon also occurs with other active airfoils such as propeller blades on the other hand two parallel vortices with opposite circulations such as the two wingtip vortices of an airplane tend to remain separate vortices contain substantial energy in the circular motion of the fluid in an ideal fluid this energy can never be dissipated and the vortex would persist forever however real fluids exhibit viscosity and this dissipates energy very slowly from the core of the vortex it is only through dissipation of a vortex due to viscosity that a vortex line can end in the fluid rather than at the boundary of the fluid further examples edit the visible core of a vortex formed when a c 17 uses high engine power at slow speed on a wet runway kármán vortex streets formed off the island of tristan da cunha in the hydrodynamic interpretation of the behaviour of electromagnetic fields the acceleration of electric fluid in a particular direction creates a positive vortex of magnetic fluid this in turn creates around itself a corresponding negative vortex of electric fluid exact solutions to classical nonlinear magnetic equations include the landau lifshitz equation the continuum heisenberg model the ishimori equation and the nonlinear schrödinger equation vortex rings are torus shaped vortices where the axis of rotation is a continuous closed curve smoke rings and bubble rings are two well known examples the lifting force of aircraft wings propeller blades sails and other airfoils can be explained by the creation of a vortex superimposed on the flow of air past the wing aerodynamic drag can be explained in large part by the formation of vortices in the surrounding fluid that carry away energy from the moving body large whirlpools can be produced by ocean tides in certain straits or bays examples are charybdis of classical mythology in the straits of messina italy the naruto whirlpools of nankaido japan and the maelstrom at lofoten norway vortices in the earth s atmosphere are important phenomena for meteorology they include mesocyclones on the scale of a few miles tornadoes waterspouts and hurricanes these vortices are often driven by temperature and humidity variations with altitude the sense of rotation of hurricanes is influenced by the earth s rotation another example is the polar vortex a persistent large scale cyclone centered near the earth s poles in the middle and upper troposphere and the stratosphere vortices are prominent features of the atmospheres of other planets they include the permanent great red spot on jupiter the intermittent great dark spot on neptune the polar vortices of venus the martian dust devils and the north polar hexagon of saturn sunspots are dark regions on the sun s visible surface photosphere marked by a lower temperature than its surroundings and intense magnetic activity the accretion disks of black holes and other massive gravitational sources taylor couette flow occurs in a fluid between two nested cylinders one rotating the other fixed summary edit in the dynamics of fluid a vortex is fluid that revolves around the axis line this fluid might be curved or straight vortices form from stirred fluids they might be observed in smoke rings whirlpools in the wake of a boat or the winds around a tornado or dust devil vortices are an important part of turbulent flow vortices can otherwise be known as a circular motion of a liquid in the cases of the absence of forces the liquid settles this makes the water stay still instead of moving when they are created vortices can move stretch twist and interact in complicated ways when a vortex is moving sometimes it can affect an angular position for an example if a water bucket is rotated or spun constantly it will rotate around an invisible line called the axis line the rotation moves around in circles in this example the rotation of the bucket creates extra force the reason that the vortices can change shape is the fact that they have open particle paths this can create a moving vortex examples of this fact are the shapes of tornadoes and drain whirlpools when two or more vortices are close together they can merge to make a vortex vortices also hold energy in its rotation of the fluid if the energy is never removed it would consist of circular motion forever see also edit physics

arnold drake and bruno premiani she first appeared in my greatest adventure 80 june 1963 2 according to drake the issue s co writer bob haney was not brought on to the project until after elasti girl was created 3 fictional character biography edit rita farr is an olympic swimming gold medalist turned hollywood actress 4 who is exposed to unusual volcanic gases while shooting a film in africa when farr recovers she discovers that she can expand or shrink her body at will from hundreds of feet tall to mere inches in height 5 when she gains greater control of her powers she discovers that she can enlarge one limb at a time 1 although not physically disfigured rita initially has no control over her size changes is considered a freak and a menace and becomes a recluse leaving her hollywood career in ruins 6 however rita is approached by dr niles caulder also known as the chief who offers her a place among fellow freaks attempting to use their powers for good as elasti girl she joins caulder s team the doom patrol 7 rita falls in love with and marries steve dayton the hero mento 8 later on the couple adopts young gar logan who would become the teen titans beast boy 1 in the jla year one storyline the martian manhunter tells rita that he was something of a fan of her chiller pictures and that he was disappointed that she did not continue making films flattered she kisses him on the cheek and later tells him that she has met alien actress sigourney weaver and that she is sure he would approve of her tragedy strikes when the doom patrol s enemies the brotherhood of evil threaten a small new england fishing village the patrol members elect to sacrifice themselves to save the innocents and are killed in an explosion it is later revealed that several members of the team actually cheated death to appear in doom patrol revivals although elasti girl would remain dead until infinite crisis 1 infinite crisis edit i remember the explosion on the island and then nothing but darkness am i supposed to be dead elasti girl teen titans 32 march 2006 when writer artist john byrne revived the doom patrol in 2004 elasti girl was among the team members reintroduced as if none of the events in prior doom patrol continuity had ever happened this situation was explained as an after effect of superboy prime s pounding on the barrier to reality which created ripples that changed reality for several characters including the original doom patrol the patrol members retain no memories of their previous lives until superboy prime breaks the phantom zone barrier during his battle with the teen titans and their allies at that moment their minds discern visions of the previous doom patrols and rita remembers everything her husband her son and her own death rita is seen in issue 7 of the 2005 storyline infinite crisis as one of the many heroes defending the city of metropolis from the army calling themselves the secret society of super villains she personally battles the giant villain giganta rita makes a cameo in issue 50 of the 2006 07 series 52 she is seen on a monitoring screen fighting black adam next to the leaning tower of pisa infinite crisis ultimately retconned byrne s reboot out of continuity one year later edit following the one year later storyline the doom patrol changes considerably losing several members and gaining beast boy bumblebee and vox 9 the explanation for rita s resurrection is that chief salvaged a piece of elasti girl s skull and used his technology to regrow her entire body due to its malleable form consequently elasti girl is very docile and is reluctant to question the chief the chief hints that her malleable form hampers her thinking abilities leading to her lack of personal initiative which makes her dependent upon caulder a k a the chief as he observes her interaction with the chief robin suspects that the chief has brainwashed rita and the other patrol members rita s husband mento is under the control of his mento helmet and believes that his wife would never love him without it following their battle against the brotherhood the titans and the doom patrol witness the chief working to convince kid devil that he is a freak and that the titans actually dislike him this pushes the teams to confront the chief mento finally removes his helmet and pointedly tells the chief that he is no longer the leader of the patrol and if he ever again insults his wife and son he will use his powers to destroy the chief s intellect rita firmly stands behind her husband breaking out of the chief s control in the most recent doom patrol series rita changed her codename to elasti woman 10 it was revealed that when the chief regrew her he did so using protoplasm to eliminate weaknesses such as bones and internal organs and therefore rita is no longer human when she sleeps rita loses her human shape and reverts to a puddle of goo having to reshape herself when she wakes up every morning powers and abilities edit rita has the ability to expand and shrink her body her powers of expansion allow her to become as large as a skyscraper she has the ability to shrink to mere inches during one adventure she was exposed to a gas that caused her to reduce to a microscopic scale and enter a sub atomic universe that experience has not been repeated rita can selectively shrink or expand parts of her body as depicted in john byrne s doom patrol retconned out of existence elasti girl could change the size of objects and people by touching them when she d release them they d revert to their normal size because of her protoplasmic physiology rita can regenerate any part of her body she can reconstruct a half blown off face or a torn leg and regrow severed limbs in doom patrol 95 may 1965 elasti girl

values and ethical code most commonly stressing a combination of sincerity frugality loyalty martial arts mastery and honour until death 7 born from neo confucianism during times of peace in the edo period 1603 1868 and following confucian texts while also being influenced by shinto and zen buddhism it allowed the violent existence of the samurai to be tempered by wisdom patience and serenity 3 bushido developed between the 16th and 20th centuries debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century although the term bushido itself is rarely attested in pre modern literature 8 this ethical code took shape with the rise of the warrior caste to power at the end of the heian period 794 1185 and the establishment of the first shogunate of the kamakura period 1185 1333 it was developed further during the muromachi period 1336 1573 and formally defined and applied in law by tokugawa shogunates in the edo period 9 10 there is no strict definition and interpretations of the code have varied over time 11 bushido has undergone many changes throughout japanese history and various japanese clans interpreted it in their own way the earliest use of the written term is in the kōyō gunkan in 1616 by kōsaka masanobu 1 12 13 14 in 1685 the ukiyo e book kokon bushidō ezukushi 古今武士道絵つくし images of bushidō through the ages by artist hishikawa moronobu included the term and artwork of samurai with simple descriptions meant for children 1 in 1642 the kashoki 可笑記 amusing notes was written by samurai saito chikamori and included moral precepts which explained the theoretical aspects of bushido 1 15 it was written with accessible kana and intended for commoners not warriors 1 it was very popular demonstrating that the idea of bushido had spread among the population 1 the kashoki shows that moral values were present in bushido by 1642 1 the term bushido came into common international usage with the 1899 publication of nitobe inazō s bushido the soul of japan which was read by many influential western people 16 in bushido 1899 nitobe wrote bushidō then is the code of moral principles which the samurai were required or instructed to observe more frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten it was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career in order to become a samurai this code has to be mastered 6 nitobe was the first to document japanese chivalry in this way 6 in feudal and modern japan 1896 historian arthur may knapp wrote the samurai of thirty years ago had behind him a thousand years of training in the law of honor obedience duty and self sacrifice it was not needed to create or establish them as a child he had but to be instructed as indeed he was from his earliest years in the etiquette of self immolation 17 chinese politician dai jitao acknowledged the historical legitimacy of bushido and said it originated as a theory of a social order but it had evolved considerably 18 14 15 in the tokugawa period bushido was used to describe an ethical theory and it became a religious concept based on shinto 18 14 15 in the meiji period bushido absorbed european ideals and formed the foundation of japan s political ethics 18 14 15 chinese writer zhou zuoren supported the historical legitimacy although it was thought to be altered and corrupted in the modern period etymology edit bushidō the way of the warrior written in japanese kanji bushidō 武士道 is a japanese word that literally means warrior way it is first attested in the 1616 work kōyō gunkan 甲陽軍鑑 a military chronicle recording the exploits of the takeda clan 19 the term is a compound of bushi 武士 warrior literally military man a chinese derived word first attested in japanese in 712 with the on yomi sino japanese reading and dō 道 road way 19 20 21 in modern usage bushi is often used as a synonym for samurai 19 20 21 however historical sources make it clear that bushi and samurai were distinct concepts with the former referring to soldiers or warriors and the latter referring instead to a kind of hereditary nobility 22 23 in the early 17th century the term bushidō 武士道 with its on yomi reading was used alongside the synonymous alternative form 武士の道 read using native japanese vocabulary kun yomi as mono no fu no michi 19 20 another important term is bushi katagi 武士気質 literally warrior temperament 24 usage edit for centuries the samurai adhered to multiple types of the code of which the interpretations varied per samurai clan and per member of the military nobility 5 1 2 this encompassed morality their role in society how to live a life with honor and virtue the samurai had some common values but they did not have a singular definition or path that all samurai were required to abide the samurai were as practical on the battlefield as any other warriors 25 these concepts codes and ideals were ingrained in the samurai since they rose to power in the kamakura period 1185 1333 26 27 9 at certain eras there were prevalent rules and unwritten customs such as the way of the bow and the horse 弓馬の道 kyūba no michi since the 12th century and in the edo period the code of the samurai was formalized with specific virtues and laws by the ruling tokugawa shogunate 1 notable samurai wrote extensively about their interpretations of bushido such as miyamoto musashi 1584 1645 and yamamoto tsunetomo 1659 1719 28 in the 1870s the meiji restoration abolished the samurai class and they were transferred to professional military and business classes 29 however the former samurai and their descendants continued to be influential in japanese society because they occupied important positions bushido has continued to exist in various types additional concepts and ideas were added to bushido so that it could evolve with the times it was used in the armed forces of the empire of japan and symbolically by the successor japan self defense forces in the taisho period bushido was advocated as the way of the merchant 30 it can be dormant for years and revived during geopolitical instability centuries of rule by the samurai class has left a deep impact on japanese society thus various forms are still used today in e g japanese culture business martial arts and communication 1 31 32 11 33 myth and reality edit bushido is often described as a specific moral code that all members of the samurai class were obligated to follow however historically the samurai adhered to multiple warrior codes and the interpretations varied per samurai clan individuals and eras 1 2 4 34 5 these codes and philosophies changed drastically during the different eras the earliest proto bushido type existed since the kamakura period 1185 26 27 9 the degrees of devoutness and interpretations varied between individuals 5 since at least the sengoku period samurai didn t have compunction to use certain weapons 5 retreating from battles did occur if it was unwinnable while others chose to fight till the end 5 samurai did not actively seek an honorable death 5 however it was honorable to die in the service of a daimyo only while furthering the daimyo s cause 5 samurai had dark customs the most notable kiri sute gomen was the right to strike lower class who dishonored them 5 seppuku was ritual suicide to die honorably or restore ones honor 5 35 tsujigiri crossroads killing to attack a human opponent to test a weapon or skill became rampant in the early edo period until a ban was issued 5 36 the exact frequency of tsujigiri is unknown and it was never condoned by any samurai clan 37 samurai did head collection with a ritual to beautify severed heads of worthy rivals and put on display 38 the samurai applied various cruel punishments on criminals the most common capital punishments up until the meiji restoration were in order of severity decapitation decapitation with disgraceful exposure of head post death crucifixion for e g parricide and death by burning with incendiaries 35 members of the samurai class had the privilege to perform hara kiri suicide disemboweling 35 if it was not lethal then a friend or relation performed decapitation seppuku 35 in 1597 toyotomi hideyoshi ordered the prosecution of 26 martyrs of japan 39 they were tortured mutilated paraded through villages and executed by crucifixion tied to crosses on a hill and impaled by lances spears 40 in the 17th century the tokugawa shogunate executed over 400 christians martyrs of japan for being more loyal to their faith than the shogunate 39 the capital punishments were beheading crucifixion death by burning and ana tsurushi 穴吊るし lit hole hanging bushido has been described as japanese chivalry 5 there are notable similarities and differences depending on which bushido type is compared with chivalry christianity had a modifying influence on the virtues of chivalry 41 whereas bushido was influenced by zen buddhism shinto and confucianism 7 1 42 bushido is commonly associated with the moral norms of nitobe inazō s bushido the soul of japan 1900 because his book popularized the term bushido internationally however it is a romanticized interpretation of bushido which differs from other historical literature by samurai thus the morals defined by nitobe do not represent all of bushido some researchers claim that chivalric bushido as defined by nitobe a k a meiji bushido was invented in the 19th century however there is a plethora of historical literature about japanese warrior codes practices philosophies since the kamakura period these types can be categorized by era into sengoku edo meiji and contemporary bushido 1 43 28 4 7 44 11 31 therefore the term bushido can be used as an overarching term for all the codes practices philosophies and principles of samurai culture 5 historical development edit the values that became bushido evolved significantly over the centuries to the present 1 18 14 15 42 45 these first appeared as unwritten customs in the 12th century with shogun minamoto yoritomo 46 the written term bushido first appears in the koyo gunkan of roughly circa 1616 an account of the military exploits of the takeda clan 1 bushido evolved from being totally devoted to valor in battle into refined types that were more related to moral integrity 1 42 the samurai had different types of bushido in each era in history reflecting changing requirements on the battlefield and in society 1 42 the era name should be used to describe the type of bushido heian kamakura 794 1333 edit koyo gunkan by kosaka masanobu 1616 shogun minamoto no yoritomo 1147 1199 the first proper japanese central government was established around the year 700 japan was ruled by the emperor tennō with bureaucratic support of the aristocracy they gradually lost control of their armed servants the samurai the samurai is similar to the old english cniht knecht knight guards or attendants 47 by the mid 12th century the samurai class had seized control the samurai bushi ruled japan with the shogun 将軍 as the overlord until the mid 19th century the shogun was originally the emperor s military deputy after the genpei war 1180 1185 minamoto no yoritomo usurped power from the civil aristocracy by establishing a military government called the bakufu situated in kamakura since 1192 48 the emperor and his court became figureheads 48 49 the appearance of bushido is linked to that of feudal japan and the first shogun at the time of minamoto no yoritomo 1147 1199 in the 12th century the own moral dimension bushido gradually appears in the warrior culture and landmark in stories and military treaties only from the 14th and 15th century 46 thus is noted a permanence of the modern representation of its antiquity in japanese culture and its diffusion in the 10th and 11th century there was the way of the man at arms tsuwamon no michi and the way of the bow and arrows kyûsen kyûya no michi citation needed at the time of the genpei war 1180 1185 it was called way of the bow and the horse 弓馬の道 kyūba no michi 1 because of the major importance of this style of combat for the warriors of the time and because it was considered a traditional method that of the oldest samurai heroes such as prince shōtoku minamoto no yorimitsu and minamoto no yoshiie hachimantarō according to louis frédéric the kyūba no michi appeared around the 10th century as a set of rules and unwritten customs that samurai were expected to comply 50 there was also yumiya toru mi no narai customs for those who draw the bow 1 this shows there was an emerging sense of ideal warrior behavior that evolved from daily training and warfare experience 42 towards the 10th and 11th centuries we began to use expressions such as the way of the man at arms tsuwamon no michi the way of the bow and arrows kyûsen kyûya no michi the way of the bow and the horse kyûba no michi these expressions refer to practices which are the ancestors of the way of the warrior bushidô but they did not then imply any relation whatsoever to a morality these were only practices focused on training for real combat and which therefore had to do with the samurai ways of life in the broad sense citation needed the world of warriors which developed in the medieval period 12th 16th century was placed under the domination of the buddhist religion buddhism makes the prohibition of killing living beings one of its main principles faced with death some samurai thought they had inherited bad karma others knew they were doing evil the buddhist notion of impermanence mujo tended to express a certain meaning to the fragility of existence beliefs in the pure land of buddha amida allowed some warriors to hope for an amidist paradise zen buddhism with its doctrine of the oneness between life and death was also appreciated by many samurai the world of medieval warriors remained a universe still largely dominated by the supernatural and the belief in particular in the tormented souls of warriors fallen in combat who returned almost obsessively in the dreams of the living this idea also ensured the success of the noh theater citation needed the tale of the heike depicts an idealized story of the genpei war 1180 1185 with a struggle between two powerful samurai clans the minamoto and the taira clearly depicted throughout the epic is the ideal of the cultivated warrior 51 during the early modern era these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the japanese man of arms citation needed the influence of shinto buddhism taoism and confucianism on bushido s early development instilled among those who live by the code a religious respect for it citation needed many early literary works of japan talk of warriors but the term bushidō does not appear in text until the edo period 52 the code which would become bushido was conceptualized during the late kamakura period 1185 1333 in japan 26 since the days of the kamakura shogunate the way of the warrior has been an integral part of japanese culture 27 9 scholars generally regard pre modern japan as a warrior nation since the medieval period 53 the samurai were role models for society since medieval times in accordance with confucianism one of their duties was to serve as a role model for society they balanced their martial arts skills with peaceful accomplishments such as literature poetry and the tea ceremony 54 such as the medieval japanese proverb hana wa sakuragi hito wa bushi japanese 花は桜木人は武士 literally the best blossom is the cherry blossom the best man is the warrior 55 in 1843 nakamura said our nation is a nation of arms the land to the west china is a nation of letters nations of letters value the pen nations of arms value the sword that s the way it has been from the beginning our country and theirs are separated from one another by hundreds of miles our customs are completely different the temperaments of our people are dissimilar so how could we possibly share the same way nakamura 1843 cited in watanabe 2012 285 56 57 muromachi azuchi 1336 1603 edit during the muromachi period 1336 1573 the way of the warrior began to refine by inserting in their daily activities alongside martial training zen meditation painting monochrome style ikebana the tea ceremony poetry such as the death poem written by samurai before suicidal missions or battles 58 and literature 9 carl steenstrup noted that 13th and 14th century writings gunki monogatari portrayed the bushi in their natural element war eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery fierce family pride and selfless at times senseless devotion of master and man 59 every farmer was basically also a warrior until hideyoshi confiscated weapons through a nation wide sword hunt in 1588 every ashigaru had his first lessons on the mentality of war from the biwa hōshi on the other hand the heike recitations also propagated civic virtues loyalty steadfastness in adversity and pride of family honor carl steenstrup 59 daimyo katō kiyomasa the sayings of sengoku period retainers and warlords such as katō kiyomasa 1562 1611 and nabeshima naoshige were generally recorded or passed down to posterity around the turn of the 16th century when japan had entered a period of relative peace in a handbook addressed to all samurai regardless of rank katō states if a man does not investigate into the matter of bushidō daily it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death thus it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one s mind well katō kiyomasa 60 katō was a ferocious warrior who banned even recitation of poetry stating one should put forth great effort in matters of learning one should read books concerning military matters and direct his attention exclusively to the virtues of loyalty and filial piety having been born into the house of a warrior one s intentions should be to grasp the long and the short swords and to die katō kiyomasa 60 clarification needed nabeshima naoshige 1538 1618 says similarly that it is shameful for any man to die without having risked his life in battle regardless of rank and that bushidō is in being crazy to die fifty or more could not kill one such a man however naoshige also suggests that everyone should personally know exertion as it is known in the lower classes 60 by the mid 16th century several of japan s most powerful warlords began to vie for supremacy over territories amidst the kyoto government s waning power with kyoto s capture by the warlord oda nobunaga in 1573 the muromachi period concluded 26 in 1551 ce one of the first western people to visit japan was the roman catholic missionary francis xavier the description of francis shows that honor weaponry and warfare were valued of utmost importance in japanese culture 43 the japanese are very ambitious of honors and distinctions and think themselves superior to all nations in military glory and valor they prize and honor all that has to do with war and all such things and there is nothing of which they are so proud as of weapons adorned with gold and silver they always wear swords and daggers both in and out of the house and when they go to sleep they hang them at the bed s head in short they value arms more than any people i have ever seen they are excellent archers and usually fight on foot though there is no lack of horses in the country they are very polite to each other but not to foreigners whom they utterly despise they spend their means on arms bodily adornment and on a number of attendants and do not in the least care to save money they are in short a very warlike people and engaged in continual wars among themselves the most powerful in arms bearing the most extensive sway they have all one sovereign although for one hundred and fifty years past the princes have ceased to obey him and this is the cause of their perpetual feuds 61 62 the practice of decapitating and collecting enemy heads is an example of honor in samurai culture 38 63 the decapitated heads were shown to a general as evidence that they killed wanted opponents and to collect rewards 63 more heads meant higher prestige honor and rewards 63 a beautification ritual of the decapitated heads called ohaguro was performed 64 38 prestigious heads were arranged on a table and presented in front of the warriors 38 63 all heads were identified and marked to prevent mistakes 63 the guards were left and right of the general and cited spells to transfix demonic spirits of the enemy 63 then a samurai said his own name lifted a box to show and describe the decapitated head 63 the general inspected the trophy heads while holding a fan so that the dead could not recognize his face 63 if the claimed head was correct then the samurai received a payment otherwise he was dismissed 63 38 despite the war torn culmination of this era and the birth of the edo period samurai codes of conduct continued to extend beyond the realms of warfare forms of bushido related zen buddhism and confucianism also emerged during this period 65 a samurai adhering to bushido like codes was expected to live a just and ethical social life honoring the practices of the gentry in the absence of military campaigns 65 edo 1603 1868 edit miyamoto musashi killing a giant creature from the book

japan enjoyed two and a half centuries of relative peace during the edo period 1600 to the mid 19th century japan didn t have domestic or international conflict these peaceful times in tokugawa society enabled bushido to be refined from a focus on valor in battle to more moral integrity 1 the tokugawa shogunate 1603 1867 codified aspects of the samurai warrior values and formalized them into parts of the japanese feudal law 10 in addition to the house codes issued in the context of the fiefdoms han and texts that described the right behavior of a warrior such as the hagakure the first buke shohatto laws for the military houses 武家諸法度 was issued by the government in 1615 which prescribed to the lords of the fiefdoms daimyo and the samurai warrior aristocracy responsibilities and activities the rules of conduct simple and decent clothing the correct supply in case of official visits etc 9 the edicts were reissued in 1629 and in 1635 by the third shogun tokugawa iemitsu the new edicts made clear the shogunate s authority and its desire to assert control 66 the swordsmanship skills of the samurai developed into character building martial arts 11 during this period the samurai class played a central role in the policing and administration of the country citation needed the bushidō literature of this time contains much thought relevant to a warrior class seeking more general

musashi the first mention of the term bushido is in the scriptures koyo gunkan 甲陽軍鑑 from takeda ryū martial arts school written around 1616 by samurai kōsaka masanobu 1527 1578 1 it consists of 20 scrolls that mention bushido over 30 times 1 it contains the history of the takeda family and their military tactics 67 the koyo gunkan describes valor and exploits in battle 1 for example it is a waste of talent when a bushido practitioner takes on administrative roles in government or financial affairs e g dealings in rice money timber or forest land it emphasis that bushido lies only in becoming as a spear on the battlefield 1 the scrolls were widely disseminated as a martial arts instruction manual by the samurai class and helped to popularize the term 1 in koyo gunkan 1616 bushido is a survival technique for individual fighters and it aims to make the development of the self and the clan troupe advantageous by raising the samurai name he also affirms that he seeks a lord who praises himself for wandering as reflected in tōdō takatora 1556 1630 s deceased memoir that a samurai cannot be called a samurai until he has changed his lords seven times also as symbolized by asakura norikage 1477 1555 the warrior may be called a beast or a dog the main thing is winning as symbolized by asakura norikage it is essential to win the battle even with the slander of cowardice the feature is that it also contains the cold hearted philosophy these are mainly related to the way of life as a samurai and they are the teachings of each family and they are also equivalent to the treatment of vassals dr hiroko willcock senior lecturer at griffith university australia explained koyo gunkan is the earliest comprehensive extant work that provides a notion of bushido as a samurai ethos and the value system of the samurai tradition 12 however it does not have a set of principles regarded as true or false but rather varying perceptions widely regarded as formidable throughout different centuries emphasized by thomas cleary confucianism buddhism and shinto were each represented by a variety of schools and elements of all three were commonly combined in japanese culture and customs as the embodiment of samurai culture bushido is correspondingly diverse drawing selectively on elements of all these traditions to articulate the ethos and discipline of the warrior 68 during the genna era 1615 1624 of the edo period and later the concept of the way of the gentleman shidō was newly established by the philosopher and strategist yamaga sokō 1622 1685 and others who tried to explain this value in the morality of the confucian cheng zhu school for the first time confucian ethics such as honor and humanity filial piety became the norm required by samurai 69 yamaga sokō was widely viewed as the sage of bushidō in early twentieth century japan 18 8 9 12 31 32 86 martial arts scholar ogasawara sakuun compiled 20 scrolls called shoke no hyōjō about the military arts in 1621 1 therein bushido is described as iji willpower 1 the scrolls describe the essence of bushido as the strength to not yield to rewards or power but adhere to personal convictions that dominate one s inner principles 1 in 1642 the kashoki 可笑記 amusing notes was written by samurai saitō chikamori 斎藤親盛 1603 1674 ex vassal of the mogami clan from yamagata domain and published 1 15 chikamori s pen name was nyoraishi 如儡子 the kashoki are 5 scrolls with wide ranging content including samurai knowledge with moral precepts 1 the knowledge of ordinary people the teachings of confucian buddhism and narrative ones it has moral precepts which explain theoretical aspects of bushido 1 the 5th scroll has an important definition that was made by a samurai 1 thus the first known description of morality in bushido and the bushido spirit was the kashoki 1 the essence of bushidō is do not lie do not be insincere do not be obsequious do not be superficial do not be greedy do not be rude do not be boastful do not be arrogant do not slander do not be unfaithful be on good terms with comrades do not be overly concerned with events show concern for one another be compassionate with a strong sense of duty being a good samurai takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one s life 5th scroll of the kashoki by saitō chikamori 1642 1 the kashoki was important with promulgating the bushido spirit among the common population 1 thus it was written for commoners not warriors 1 its accessibility made it very popular because it was written in kana hiragana and katakana rather than kanji which can be read by people with elementary school reading skills 1 there were many editions which had major influence on the behavior of commoners such as adults adolescents women and generations 1 master swordsman miyamoto musashi s life exemplifies bushido 28 musashi 1584 1645 wrote the book of five rings gorin no sho around 1643 28 it consists of five volumes earth water fire wind and void the book of earth describes the general framework of bushidō 28 for example apply skills in any situation always carry two swords learn how to effectively use the lance naginata bow and arrow and guns a daimyo should know the strength of his troops and how to properly deploy them devote yourself to training to master a way avoid evil acts and thoughts broaden perspectives with arts and knowledge about different professions make objective judgments etc 28 in 1685 the ukiyo e book kokon bushidō ezukushi 古今武士道絵つくし images of bushidō through the ages by artist hishikawa moronobu 1618 1694 was published 1 it features heroic popular tales of samurai warriors with simple descriptions per artwork 1 the title includes the word bushido and it was meant for children which shows that it had spread among the general population 1 the chinese politician dai jitao 1891 1949 attended nihon university s law program in 1907 he was fluent in japanese and learned about bushido dai criticized the supposedly violent nature of the traditional japanese feudal class structure before the meiji period dai said the samurai brutally exploited the class structure to abuse and kill people below them in the social order and biasedly claimed the opposite for chinese society as peace loving according to dai after confucianism became influential in the 17th century it brought ideas of benevolence and humanity that pacified the cruel samurai and set japan upon the course to become a modern and civilized society dai also appreciated aspects of the samurai for example dai said japan continued to benefit from their spirit of self sacrifice selfless loyalty and after confucianism was introduced compassion dai blamed the problems of modern japan post meiji restoration due to the loss of samurai virtues when the former merchant class gained power and large corporations started to steer government policy 70 dai said after the samurai class was heavily influenced by confucian ideals of compassion their bushido became essentially a life of blood and tears because they selflessly shed blood for their lords and cried tears of compassion for farmers and other lower class people 18 16 the hagakure contains many sayings attributed to sengoku period retainer nabeshima naoshige 1537 1619 regarding bushidō related philosophy early in the 18th century by yamamoto tsunetomo 1659 1719 a former retainer to naoshige s grandson nabeshima mitsushige the hagakure was compiled in the early 18th century but was kept as a kind of secret teaching of the nabeshima clan until the end of the tokugawa bakufu 1867 44 his saying i have found the way of the warrior is death was a summation of the focus on honour and reputation over all else that bushidō codified 71 this is occasionally misinterpreted that bushido is a code of death the true meaning is by having a constant consciousness of death people can achieve a state of freedom that transcends life and death whereby it is possible to perfectly fulfill one s calling as a warrior 1 tokugawa era rōnin scholar and strategist yamaga sokō 1622 1685 wrote extensively on matters relating to bushidō bukyō a warrior s creed and a more general shidō a way of gentlemen intended for application to all stations of society sokō attempts to codify a kind of universal bushidō with a special emphasis on pure confucian values rejecting the mystical influences of tao and buddhism in neo confucian orthodoxy while at the same time calling for recognition of the singular and divine nature of japan and japanese culture these radical concepts including ultimate devotion to the emperor regardless of rank or clan put him at odds with the reigning shogunate he was exiled to the akō domain the future setting of the 47 rōnin incident and his works were not widely read until the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century citation needed painting of ōishi yoshio committing seppuku 1703 the aging yamamoto tsunetomo s interpretation of bushidō is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience at once dutiful and defiant ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society of the 47 rōnin to this day generally regarded as exemplars of bushidō tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily delayed plot for revenge and had been over concerned with the success of their undertaking instead tsunetomo felt true samurai should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties without regard for success or failure citation needed this romantic sentiment is of course expressed by warriors throughout history though it may run counter to the art of war itself this ambivalence is found in the heart of bushidō and perhaps all such warrior codes some combination of traditional bushidō s organic contradictions and more universal or progressive formulations like those of yamaga sokō would inform japan s disastrous military ambitions in the 20th century citation needed according to the social psychologist toshio yamagishi ja 山岸俊男 1948 2018 bushido is the ideal human image formed mainly in the edo period in other words a virtue in the groupism

samurai 73 samurai originally fought for personal matters and the honor of their family and clan when japan was unified the role of samurai included public administrative responsibilities such as public order preservation judicial responsibility infrastructure maintenance disaster recovery farmland development healthcare administration and industrial promotion 1 the samurai class was abolished in the 1870s and the role of those in it grew more bureaucratic focusing on the formation of a modern nation state with the diminishing of social classes some values were transferred to the whole population such as loyalty to the emperor 9 the author yukio mishima asserted that invasionism or militarism had nothing to do with bushidō from the outset according to mishima a man of bushido is someone who has a firm sense of self respect takes responsibility for his actions and sacrifices himself to embody that responsibility dai jitao credited the samurai with sole responsibility for the meiji restoration which enabled japan s modernization while the populace merely allowed it to happen 18 dai argued that japanese combative tendency and militarism were purely founded in japan s socio religious superstitions centered on the notion of divine authority 18 33 it did not exist in chinese or indian thought 18 33 bushido was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military who doctored it to suit their needs 74 the original imperial rescript to soldiers and sailors of 1882 uses the word hōkoku 報国 signifying the idea of indebtedness to one s nation because of one s birth such debt must be repaid through physical or mental exertion this idea did not exist in earlier bushido chinese writer zhou zuoren regarded the bushido promoted by the military as a corruption of a noble and ancient tradition 75 he discussed the act of seppuku and the importance of old samurai practices in his 1935 essay series riben guankui he named the story of the forty seven rōnin of the akō domain who were sentenced to seppuku after avenging their daimyo and their legacy in the story chūshingura a treasury of loyal retainers he discussed the sakai incident in which 20 samurai from tosa domain committed seppuku in 1868 for attacking french sailors these examples were compared with the soft punishment given to the soldiers who assassinated prime minister inukai tsuyoshi in 1932 zhou condemned them for not taking responsibility by committing suicide like traditional samurai 75 in 1936 zhou wrote about the loss of humanity and empathy of traditional bushido during the deterioration of the second world war he pointed to the samurai novel specify by jun ichirō tanizaki as an example where victors of a battle treated enemy corpses with dignity 70 227 bushido regained popularity and became intertwined with japan s nationalist expression in the mid 1800s in response to britain s invasion of china in the first opium war xenophobia toward westerners rose in japan during the 1850s and 1860s which contributed to the perceived legitimacy of the imperial restoration use of bushido in text increased during this period and its concept was viewed with more positivity while it disappeared during the 1870s it reappeared in the 1880s to express the loss of traditional values during the rapid introduction of western civilization and a renewed sense of urgency to defend japanese traditions 76 the victory of japan over china in 1895 restored a feeling of pride in bushido which was considered the origin of military success 77 the researcher oleg benesch argued that the concept of modern bushido changed throughout the modern era as a response to foreign stimuli in the 1880s such as the english concept of the gentleman nitobe inazō s bushido interpretations followed a similar trajectory though he was following earlier trends this relatively pacifistic bushido was hijacked and adapted by militarists and the government from the early 1900s as nationalism increased around the time of the russo japanese war 78 the entrepreneur fukuzawa yukichi appreciated bushido and emphasized that maintaining the morale of scholars is the essence of eternal life 79 80 nitoto inazuke submitted his book bushido to emperor meiji and stated bushido is prosperous here assists komo and promotes the national style so that the public will return to the patriotic virtues of loyal ministers he wrote that bushido has slightly different requirements for men and women for women bushido means guarding their chastity educating their children supporting their husbands and maintaining their families 81 the junshi suicide of general nogi maresuke and his wife on the death of emperor meiji earned praise as an example of opposition to the trend of decaying morals in japan it also earned criticism from those who believed that aspect of bushido should not be revived 82 after the meiji restoration the martial arts etiquette represented by ogasawara ryū 小笠原流 popularized training 83 bushido influenced martial arts and education corresponded with nationalistic ideals prevalent prior to 1941 honoring tradition through bushido inspired martial skills enabled society to remain interconnected harnessing society s reverence of ancestral practices for national strength 84 according to researcher william r patterson the martial arts were seen as a way not to maintain ancient martial techniques but instead to preserve a traditional value system bushido that could be used to nurture national spirit in the midst of modernization the japanese were struggling to hold onto some traditions that were uniquely japanese and that could unify them as countrymen 84 for example kanō jigorō argued because judo developed based on the martial arts of the past if the martial arts practitioners of the past had things that are of value those who practice judo should pass all those things on among these the samurai spirit should be celebrated even in today s society citation needed during interbellum and second world war shōwa japan bushido was pressed into use for militarism 85 to present war as purifying and death a duty 86 bushido was pitched as revitalizing traditional values and transcending the modern 87 bushido would provide a spiritual shield to let soldiers fight to the end 88 when giving orders general hideki tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command saying face slapping was a means of training men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste and for whom bushido was not second nature 89 tojo wrote a chapter in the book hijōji kokumin zenshū essays in time of national emergency which the army ministry published in march 1934 it called for japan to become a totalitarian national defense state 90 it included 15 essays by senior generals and argued japan defeated russia in the russo japanese war because bushido gave the japanese superior willpower they did not fear death unlike the russians who wanted to live 91 when the aircraft carrier uss bunker hill was hit by two kamikazes on 11 may 1945 there were 389 personnel killed or officially listed as missing and 264 were wounded 92 as the second world war turned the spirit of bushido was invoked to urge that all depended on the firm and united soul of the nation 93 when japan lost the battle of attu the government attempted to paint the more than two thousand japanese deaths as an inspirational epic for the fighting spirit of the nation 94 arguments that the plans for the battle of leyte gulf involving all japanese ships would expose japan to serious danger if they failed were countered with the plea that the navy be permitted to bloom as flowers of death 95 the japanese believed that indoctrination in bushido would give them the edge as the japanese longed to die for the emperor while the americans were afraid to die however superior american pilot training and airplanes meant the japanese were outclassed by the americans 96 the first proposals of organized suicide attacks met resistance while bushido called for a warrior to be always aware of death they were not to view it as the sole end however desperation brought about acceptance 97 and such attacks were acclaimed as the true spirit of bushido 98 bushido regarded surrender as cowardly those who did forfeited their honor and lost dignity and respect 99 as japan continued its modernization in the early 20th century her armed forces became convinced that success in battle would be assured if japanese soldiers sailors and airmen had the spirit of bushido the result was that the bushido code of behavior was inculcated into the japanese soldier as part of his basic training each soldier was indoctrinated to accept that it was the greatest honor to die for the emperor and it was cowardly to surrender to the enemy bushido therefore explains why the japanese in the nei so mistreated pows in their custody those who had surrendered to the japanese regardless of how courageously or honorably they had fought merited nothing but contempt they had forfeited all honor and literally deserved nothing consequently when the japanese murdered pows by shooting beheading and drowning these acts were excused since they involved the killing of men who had forfeited all rights to be treated with dignity or respect while civilian internees were certainly in a different category from pows it is reasonable to think that there was a spill over effect from the tenets of bushido fred borch military trials of war criminals in the netherlands east indies 1946 1949 the practice of beheading captured soldiers and prisoners originates from samurai culture in the 14th century or earlier 38 63 japanese propaganda claimed prisoners of war captured during the second world war denied mistreatment and declared they were treated well by virtue of bushido generosity 100 broadcast interviews with prisoners were described as not propaganda and voluntarily given based on such sympathy for the enemy that only bushido could inspire 101 during the second world war many japanese infantry were trapped on guam surrounded by allied forces and low on supplies 102 despite being outnumbered and in horrific conditions many soldiers refused to surrender nitobe inazō wrote they continued to honor the bushido code believing that to rush into the thick of battle and to be slain in it is easy enough but it is true courage to live when it is right to live and to die only when it is right to die 103 104 contemporary bushido edit bushido is still present in the social and economic organization of japan 1 the samurai spirit and the virtues can still be found in japanese society 1 notable japanese consider bushido an important part of their culture 105 certain people use aspects of bushido as a way of life 105 31 business edit bushido affects myriad aspects in japanese society and culture in addition to impacts on military performance media entertainment martial arts medicine and social work the bushido code has catalyzed corporate behavior it is the mode of thought which historically structured the capitalist activity in the 20th century business relations the close relationship between the individual and the group to which he or she belongs the notions of trust respect and harmony within the japanese business world are based on bushido therefore this is at the origin of the industrial harmony ja 労使協調 ideology of modern japan it allowed the country to become with the japanese economic miracle the economic leader of asia in the post war years of the 1950 1960s the industrialist eiichi shibusawa preached bushido as necessary for future times and the spirit of japanese business from the meiji era to the taishō democracy was advocated which became the backbone necessary for japanese management 106 shinya fujimura examines samurai ethics in the academic article the samurai ethics a paradigm for corporate behavior bushido principles indicate that rapid economic growth does not have to be a goal of modern existence 107 relatedly economic contentment is attainable regardless of hegemonic gross domestic product statistics 108 in fujimura s words the tradition permeates the country s corporate culture and has informed many of its social developments 109 fujimura states egalitarian principles practiced by the samurai have permeated through modern business society and culture principles like honorable poverty seihin encourage those with power and resources to share their wealth directly influencing national success 109 bushido also provides enterprises with social meaning eloquently described by fujimura the moral purpose that bushido articulates transcends booms and busts it is often said that a japanese company is like a family with executives caring about employees and employees showing respect to executives bushido then is part of the basis for a sense of national identity and belonging an ideal that says the japanese are one people in it together 110 in taiwan there continued to be positive views of bushido 111 such as late roc president lee teng hui 1923 2020 admired traditional japanese values and bushido influenced him 31 in japanese taiwan teng hui learned kendo in school and he was deeply influenced by bushido and the japanese bushido spirit which had a significant impact on his future life 112 he wrote the 2003 japanese book bushido precis what is noblesse oblige which strived to boost japan s morale during the economic stagnation by appealing to japan s warrior spirit 111 communication edit in utilization of bushido s seven virtues the samurai code has been renewed to contribute towards development of communication skills between adult japanese couples composed in 2012 the empirical document the bushido matrix for couple communication identifies a methodology which can be employed by counseling agents to guide adults in self reflection and share emotions with their partner this activity centers on the bushido matrix worksheet bmw 113 the authors accentuate practicing bushido virtues can ultimately enhance intra and interpersonal relationship beginning with personal awareness and extending to couple awareness 32 when utilizing the matrix a couple is asked to identify one of the seven virtues and apply it to their past and current perceptions surrounding its prevalence in their lives 32 if individuals identify their relationship to be absent that specific virtue they may now ponder of its inclusion for their benevolence 114 martial arts edit iaido sensei haruna matsuo the bushido spirit exists in japanese martial arts 11 modern bushido focuses more on self defense fighting sports tournaments and just physical fitness training while all of these things are important to the martial arts a much more important thing is missing which is personal development bushido s art taught soldiers the important secrets of life how to raise children how to dress how to treat family and other people how to cultivate personality things related to finances all of these things are important to be a respected soldier although modern bushido is guided by eight virtues citation needed that alone is not enough bushido not only taught one how to become a soldier but all the stages of life the warrior described by bushido is not a profession but a way of life it is not necessary to be in the army to be a soldier the term warrior refers to a person who is fighting for something not necessarily physically man is a true warrior because of what is in his heart mind and soul everything else is just tools in the creation to make it perfect bushido is a way of life that means living in every moment honorably and honestly all this is of great importance in the life of a soldier both now and in the past 115 in the book kata the true essence of budo martial arts simon dodd and david brown state that bushido spiritualism led the martial art bujutsu to evolve into modern budō 武道 45 for their analysis they review the kamakura period to reiterate the influence bushido held in martial arts evolution 45 they distinctly state for clarity any reference to bushido is in relation to bujutsu within the kamakura to pre meiji restoration period pre 1868 and any links to budo are referring to the modern form of the martial arts 45 to supplement this affirmation dodd and brown discuss the variance between the meaning behind bujutsu and budo according to todd and brown budo is a redevelopment of traditional kamakura period martial arts principles budo defines the way of the warrior through roots in religious ethics and philosophy the martial art form s translation binds it to confucian and buddhist concepts of bushido 45 respected karate ka kousaku yokota explains how bujutsu could be considered the art of fighting or killing and encompasses a win at all costs mentality required for battlefield survival yokota 2010 p 185 conversely budo could be considered the art of living or life and enables a practitioner to live honestly and righteously or at least with principles expanding on both these points deshimaru 1982 p 11 p 46 reports that the ideogram for bu means to the cease the struggle and that in budo the point is to find peace and mastery of the self 45 the iaidō in its transmission and its practice is the martial art which takes up in its entirety bushido by the etiquette the code of honor the dress the carrying of the sword and the fight against oneself rather than against the opponent modern combat sports like kendo derive their philosophy from bushido unlike other martial arts prolonged contact or multiple hits tend to be disadvantaged in favor of simple clean attacks on the body bushido has also inspired the code of honor for disciplines such as aikijutsu aikido aikibudo judo jujitsu kyudo or the chanbara kendo has the bushido spirit such as epitomized by the motto ken zen ichi nyo lit the sword and zen are one 剣 禅 一 如 11 the philosopher tetsuro watsuji 1889 1960 wrote that kendo involves raising a struggle to a life transcending level by freeing oneself from an attachment to life 11 kendo inculcates moral instruction through strict adherence to a code of etiquette 11 there are kamidana miniature shinto shrine in the dojo 11 the basic attitude in kendo is noble by shunning base feelings and the aim is conquering the self 11 way of life edit there are people who use bushido as a way of life for example the japanese music artist gackt said that his philosophical way of life is similar to bushido 33 105 in 2011 during interviews about his martial arts action movie bunraku 2010 he said being japanese bushido is my roots and is an important part of my country s culture i believe it is my role to share this beautiful culture with the world bushido is a big part of me personally as well as in my professional career 105 bushido is also the core of how i think feel and live so i felt this was a great opportunity for me to express to the world what bushido really means 33 gackt other notable people who use bushido in life are for example former roc president lee teng hui 1923 2020 31 in october 2011 spain s prince of asturias award for concord was given to the heroes of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster aka the fukushima 50 11 they were praised for their conduct which embodied the values most deeply rooted in japanese society and courage and exemplary behaviour with self sacrifice 11 this was described by the media as samurai spirit 11 japan self defense forces edit jsdf soldiers during a training exercise the japan self defense forces jsdf are the successor of the armed forces of the empire of japan which existed from 1868 till 1947 116 the jsdf was officially established with the self defense forces act in 1954 act no 165 of 1954 117 it is primarily used for national defense due to limitations of article 9 of the japanese constitution bushido is only used symbolically for example with names for combat exercises such as exercise bushido guardian 2019 118 there are supporters and opposition for introducing bushido to the jsdf supporters edit since 2000 numerous general officers proclaimed the importance of bushido with lectures 119 bushido is useful for uniting troops with slogans such as bravery discipline and honesty 119 takashi araya is an author martial artist and jgsdf veteran 1982 2008 who established the first special forces of the jsdf 119 araya wrote the 2015 book to those who fight japan s cause and bushido 120 he describes the essence of bushido which was created over a thousand years and stresses the importance of training soldiers with bushido 120 he argues the purpose of japanese martial arts is not to kill other people but to cleanse their evil spirits and open the way for coexistence and co prosperity 120 he says by training soldiers with bushido they can become the strongest fighting special forces 120 he wants jsdf members to inherit bushido to be brave and live dignifiedly 120 by using the action philosophy of bushido they can become not only strong technologically but also spiritually 120 opposition edit some critics say that excessive praise of bushido could repeat the mistakes of the former imperial armed forces 119 the old japanese military officer training of the ija emphasized courage under fire assault instead of scientific ability 119 this created close solidarity between the soldiers and officers but the officers lacked skills that the soldiers did not have 119 japanese troops put high significance on dying bravely and spiritual value instead of long term endurance 119 this resulted in an inclination toward spirituality that ignores reality 119 this ethos exists in the jsdf by having officers act like soldiers to earn their loyalty with the courage of bushido it causes sleep deprivation 119 it s disputed whether it has significance for modern warfare such as space warfare and cyberwarfare 119 there was a case of a national police reserve 1950 1954 member who committed seppuku to apologize for being unable to become an ideal soldier 119 this was a wasteful loss of life another example was a young squadron commander who failed an exercise due to repeating to attack rather than change tactics 119 the pre war imperial japanese navy researcher alexander chiralfi said the japanese mindset was subjective and had no interest to academically analyze unrelated maritime issues 119 subjective and short sighted discussions don t yield wise strategies 119 the ideal image of executives should change according to the times and strategic environment 119 thus the feudal bushido may not fit in a modern strategic environment and culture 119 critics argue the meiji army defeated the qing and the imperial russian army not because of bushido but because it was a professional military organization 119 therefore bushido should not become the values of the whole jsdf 119 rather the ideal image of jsdf executives should be defined to achieve national interests 119 bushido types and tenets edit multiple bushido types have existed through history the code varied due to influences such as zen buddhism shinto confucianism as well as changes in society and on the battlefield 7 1 42 the consistent ideal is martial spirit including athletic military skills and valor fearlessness toward the enemy in battle 7 1 bushido is a path that the samurai of each era pursued for their entire existence sengoku bushido edit period muromachi azuchi sengoku period 1336 1603 representative and important figures takeda shingen uesugi kenshin oda nobunaga tokugawa ieyasu katō kiyomasa nabeshima naoshige during this era the daimyo expanded their territory by force and strategy battles occurred frequently in various places the purpose was to expand one s power the killing of the enemy in a battle led to evaluation certain daimyos wrote about moral codes with influence from zen buddhism and confucianism there was not yet a strong attachment to moral values apart from honor in samurai society honor weaponry and warfare were valued of utmost importance in japanese culture 43 low priority was placed on monetary savings 43 tenets edit honor 43 warfare 43 weapon mastery 43 28 martial arts 7 1 valor in battle 1 early moral codes edo bushido edit period early to late edo 1603 1868 representative and important figures kōsaka masanobu saito chikamori yamaga soko daidoji tomoyama yagyu munenori yamaoka tesshu miyamoto musashi yamamoto tsunetomo hishikawa moronobu after the chaotic sengoku period politics were carried out in orderly fashion and peace was maintained the samurai could no longer obtain merit on the battlefield they found more significance of the samurai s existence in areas other than battle as per confucianism it was valued to work for morals and the public not for personal reasons in addition there were many martial arts who included religious boundaries such as buddhism and shinto a famous example is a passage in the hagakure bushido is realised in the presence of death in the case of having to choose between life and death you should choose death there is no other reasoning move on with determination it can be difficult to interpret but it was radical at the time that appeared in the taihei era of the edo period the oral tradition of the saga domain feudal lord nabeshima mitsushige yamamoto tsunetomo is the main subject there are many expressions that criticize the samurai who are associated with confucianism and buddhism that were popular at the time there are many works that guide the art of treatment while describing the spirit of the samurai of the sengoku period tenets edit bushidō expanded and formalized the earlier code of the samurai and stressed sincerity frugality loyalty mastery of martial arts and honour to the death under the bushidō ideal if a samurai failed to uphold his honor he could only regain it by performing seppuku ritual suicide 7 the core of bushido consists of a combination of teachings from japan s three main philosophical traditions 1 buddhist precepts of serenity stoicism and non attachment to life 2 shinto notions of fidelity and patriotism and 3 confucian morality 11 people imbued with bushi katagi 武士気質 lit samurai spirit can serenely carry out their work in the face of any adversity and have the willpower to master themselves 11 taira shigesuke daidōji yūzan wrote bushido shoshinshu 武道初心集 pre 1730 which provides practical and moral instructions for samurai to improve personal social and professional standards 4 in an excerpt from his book samurai the world of the warrior 121 historian stephen turnbull describes the role of seppuku in feudal japan in the world of the warrior seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated disgraced or mortally wounded it meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced the cutting of the abdomen released the samurai s spirit in the most dramatic fashion but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony bushidō varied dramatically over time and across the geographic and socio economic backgrounds of the samurai who represented somewhere between 5 and 10 of the japanese population 2 the first meiji era census at the end of the 19th century counted 1 282 000 members of the high samurai allowed to ride a horse and 492 000 members of the low samurai allowed to wear two swords but not to ride a horse in a country of about 25 million 122 some versions of bushidō include compassion for those of lower station and for the preservation of one s name 60 early bushidō literature further enforces the requirement to conduct oneself with calmness fairness justice and propriety 60 the relationship between learning and the way of the warrior is clearly articulated one being a natural partner to the other 60 other pundits pontificating on the warrior philosophy covered methods of raising children appearance and grooming but all of this may be seen as part of one s constant preparation for death to die a good death with one s honor intact the ultimate aim in a life lived according to bushidō indeed a good death is its own reward and by no means assurance of future rewards in the afterlife some samurai though certainly not all e g amakusa shirō have throughout history held such aims or beliefs in disdain or expressed the awareness that their station as it involves killing precludes such reward especially in buddhism japanese beliefs surrounding the samurai and the afterlife are complex and often contradictory while the soul of a noble warrior suffering in hell or as a lingering spirit occasionally appears in japanese art and literature so does the idea of a warrior being reborn upon a lotus throne in paradise 123 the essence of bushido was defined by saitō chikamori as 1 7 sincerity do not lie do not be insincere do not be superficial responsibility do not be obsequious frugality do not be greedy 1 politeness do not be rude do not slander modesty do not be boastful do not be arrogant loyalty do not be unfaithful harmony be on good terms with comrades tranquility do not be overly concerned with events compassion show concern for one another be compassionate with a strong sense of duty meiji bushido edit period

the will of the emperor 5 with an emphasis on loyalty and self sacrifice 34 the book bushido the soul of japan by nitobe inazō popularized bushido internationally during the meiji era however the morals that he described are romanticized interpretations and do not represent all of bushido through history in the taishō era bushido as the way of the merchant was advocated by industrialist shibusawa eiichi 1840 1931 known as the father of japanese capitalism 30 shibusawa was also a warrior who learned shindō munen ryū and hokushin ittō ryū he spent some time as a vassal of tokugawa yoshinobu and since the meiji era he was a businessman and involved in the establishment of hundreds of corporations in his book theory and arithmetic 論語と算盤 he advocated the word samurai business talent 士魂商才 he linked the spirit of the samurai bushido with the influence of confucianism to economic activity and denied immoral merchants for self interest eight virtues of bushido as defined by nitobe inazō edit the bushidō code is typified by eight virtues according to nitobe inazō in the meiji period 1900 6 nitobe defined bushido as the ways which fighting nobles should observe in their

research into bushidō was later conducted by william scott wilson in his 1982 text ideals of the samurai writings of japanese warriors the writings span hundreds of years family lineage geography

mercenary until a conflict with the doom patrol forced him into retirement due to the conflict he was forced to wear a neck and back brace later zahl now calling himself general zahl assisted madame rouge in apparently killing the doom patrol madame rouge had previously succeeded also apparently in destroying the other members of the brotherhood of evil 1 years later changeling robotman and the teen titans tracked down zahl and rouge near the conflict s end zahl determined to not be taken alive fired upon robotman knowing the bullets would ricochet and strike zahl which they did as zahl lay

woman at gunpoint though zahl was defeated the woman was killed general zahl planted two detonators on two nearby islands with the doom patrol deciding on which island to save with the choice being televised around the world when batman breaks free enough for the doom patrol to escape he assembles the villains he had gathered when general zahl mentions that the actual detonator control is on his hat and activates it the doom patrol are caught in the explosion while batman used a knock out gas on the other villains he even mourned the doom patrol s sacrifice namely because he failed to reveal

clone of jon lane kent and finally tells red robin that his future self entrusted on him as garfield was able to know his name a thing that no other titan knew and that was all part of future tim s plan to use garfield as the source of this information for his past self so he might be able to change the course of the future after that garfield with rose s help rescue an injured and unconscious jon lane due to a clash with kon now with jon lane treated but still unconscious even though gar and rose express their desire to kill him for all the things he has done they put in action a plan that involves changing the places of kon and jon lane as the superboy dressing the latter in a copy of kon s costume as another attempt to avoid those terrible events from happening again with the return

reflect recent events or newly available information may 2018 beast boy once again joins the teen titans led by damian wayne along with starfire raven and kid flash following dark nights metal and justice league no justice the breaching of the source wall causes the powers of many of earth s metahuman population to become erratic in beast boy s case he occasionally transforms into a monstrous hulking version of himself often going on rampages until he can regain his senses wanting to assist other metahumans affected by the source wall like himself he joins nightwing s new incarnation of the titan s joining with raven miss martian donna troy and steel following a confrontation between the titans and mother blood beast boy gains control over his new transformation 31 powers and abilities edit beast boy has the ability to morph and transform into any animal that he has seen himself or has seen in an illustration as is the case when he shapeshifts into an animal such as an extinct dinosaur 6 7 these transformations take only 1 second and beast boy has demonstrated that he is capable of rapidly changing his form with little or no effort expended as a corollary to this power he can transform back into his default form if an external force like magic transforms him into an animal his power enables him to completely alter his body mass being able to take the shape of animals far larger and heavier than himself such as an elephant a hippopotamus or a tyrannosaurus rex though until recent stories such larger forms would physically exhaust him or smaller and lighter animals such as mice arachnids and insects as a result of his rapidly changing genetic structure and mass beast boy has an increased healing factor comparable to that of the creeper and deathstroke allowing him to heal from bullet wounds burns and broken bones in a matter of seconds and in some story lines regrow entire limbs he cannot change or return to a form if the space he occupies is too small and he cannot normally break through confines as seen when he attempts to transform into a tyrannosaurus rex underneath a bridge and hits his head instantly aborting the transformation his power also enables him to radically alter his body structure and take forms of animals without limbs like snakes or those without skeletons like a jellyfish in two notable instances he has even taken the form of multiple individuals simultaneously once as a swarm of fireflies and again as a mass of barnacles in another comic he was seen to take on the form of what appeared to be a green version of beast from x men beast boy s transformations have not been limited to earth life forms when on a rescue mission in the vegan system to free starfire he easily transformed into a gordanian one of the green skinned alien warriors native to the system in order to sneak robin and cyborg onto a warship in the who is wonder girl story arc he was able to infiltrate another alien world after being shown a green skinned creature native to the planet he had some difficulty with this change claiming that earth animal forms he knew instinctively but was successful in the transformation when he pursued madame rouge in revenge for her role in killing his foster mother rita farr he began transforming into creatures that do not even exist products of his subconscious rage against the villainess while an animal he gains all of the physical abilities attributes and characteristics of said animal such as greatly enhanced superhuman strength a gorilla superhuman speed a cheetah and enhanced durability a turtle and abilities such as flight various birds and aquatic breathing various fish he can even gain the specific poisons and toxins produced by specific snakes he also gains the ability to survive or otherwise live in the same hostile environments some animals can as seen in one comic where he morphs into a parasitic worm to become resistant to the stomach acid and immune system of brother blood when he dived into the villain s intestinal tract to retrieve raven s chakra while in animal form beast boy retains his human intellect memories and the ability to speak no matter what form he takes his skin hair and eyes remain green making most of his animal forms easy to distinguish from real animals of that species in the dc marvel crossover with the x men his attempt to infiltrate darkseid s forces and stop him from recreating dark phoenix was frustrated by the fact that darkseid s minions are not green in the early comics his coloration would change to that appropriate to the animal form he had taken with only his head remaining green when raven implanted garfield with an evil seed of her father trigon he began to transform into more demon like creatures eventually he found himself more comfortable in these horrific shapes than as a human and stayed shifted after becoming completely corrupted by the evil seed he was used by raven and trigon but eventually returned to normal titans vol 4 4 reveals that a small part of that seed still remains within him which trigon s sons manipulate using the demonic energies to open the portal to trigon s realm volume issue needed according to marv wolfman and george pérez the reason garfield is never seen shapeshifting into other humans although his powers should allow it is because any human he turns into would be green and there would be no point for him to use that ability unless he was turning into someone like the hulk 32 in the series tales of the teen titans it s implied that garfield also has unexplored psionic abilities although mento s psionic helmet is only capable of amplifying its user s psionic abilities citation needed garfield was shown to successfully use it to trick the teen titans into perceiving him as slade 33 he maintains great proficiency in hand to hand combat and is capable of defeating well trained hand to hand fighters though he s not considered to be at a level comparable to batman or deathstroke volume issue needed at one point he has displayed an ability to read lips which he used to discover an assassination plot that galtry devised against him 7 other versions edit a character called changeling is first seen in action comics 400 in the story my son is he man or beast written by leo dorfman and illustrated by curt swan and murphy anderson cover by neal adams gregor nagy a late friend s son gained the power to temporarily metamorphosize his body into other forms primarily animal forms from a failed experiment of his father s superman is named gregor s guardian and he teaches changeling to use his powers for good gregor is killed when he manages to imitate superman s powers and goes on a deep sea rescue mission only to be crushed by the underwater pressure when his temporary powers start to fade in the titans tomorrow storyline beast boy calls himself animal man in this storyline he has the power to use more than one animal power at a time such as using an amoeba s power to split to create copies of himself while in the form of another creature he also demonstrates the ability to become mythical animals and is much more feral than his more fun loving former self in teen titans earth one gar logan changeling is re introduced as a founding member of the titans here portrayed a group of children as part of star lab s experiments with the meta gene 34 in the possible future seen in the 1996 miniseries kingdom come beast boy has changed his name to menagerie and for unspecified reasons can only transform into mythical creatures in the mash up storyline seen in issues 60 61 of superman batman the two heroes were sent to an alternate dimension by doctor destiny this world was home to the justice titans and amalgamation of the justice league and the teen titans this world s version of beast boy was known as hawkbeast a combination of beast boy and hawkman in the alternate timeline of the 2011 flashpoint storyline changeling was

transforming rex mason into the metamorphae known as metamorpho the element man after java knocked out rex mason in the presence of it 1 for years java lusted after simon s daughter sapphire stagg but was unable to win her heart because she was in love with metamorpho this bred a bitter rivalry between the two one that persisted for many years java even risked his life once to save sapphire from a melting skyscraper and was transformed into a petrified fossil for his actions stagg s scientific prowess saved his life and returned him to normal 1 during a time when metamorpho was believed to be dead sapphire relented to java s persistent advances and married him java became the father figure to sapphire and rex s mutant son joey java was not an inherently evil individual but his moral base had been compromised due to his constant exposure to the unscrupulous simon stagg he was also extremely selfish when it came to his wants and desires when rex abducted joey from stagg mansion java flew into a rage and was determined to kill him even simon s command over him could not quell java s emotions frustrated by the neanderthal s rare act of defiance simon stagg shot him in the head seemingly killing him 2 java did not remain dead for long however the means behind his resurrection are unknown but he was seen once again several years later attending the funeral of metamorpho who at the time was believed to be dead 3 during the brightest day storyline java was with simon stagg at his canadian estate at the time when metamorpho persuaded him to help him and the outsiders get back into the united states later that night java pays metamorpho a visit while he was sleeping for some reason java still had the orb of ra in his possession java uses the orb to knock metamorpho around until metamorpho becomes unconscious 4 java then takes metamorpho s body down to simon stagg s lab where he plans to merge him with chemo it doesn t go well as java calls in simon stagg s

luggage compartment citing regulations one of the vials broke damaging the carriage and causing it to derail until the train was stopped by green lantern stagg reprimanded java for this failure as it drew unwarranted attention to his operations true enough stagg hadn t finished when rex mason inquired about java s presence on the train this and the fact that mason was seeing stagg s daughter sapphire led him to test out the metamorpho project on mason the morning after java accompanied stagg to mason s hospital room after learning what had happened rex went mad but java could not stop him and was knocked out with a bed pan following mason s trail stagg was eager to get pictures of everything using them to pit mason against his old friend john stewart after reviewing the success of his designs in battle he sat back to consider the military applications but mason caught on to him and easily dispatched java down but not out java reached for a canister of liquid nitrogen and froze him java oversaw stagg s attempts to refine the metamorpho mutagen when metamorpho barged into the lab this time mason went straight for the nitrogen knocking java into a cabinet in mason s fight with

put into a coma that would last until halfway into the series while in the hospital she was kidnapped by the butterfly collector known as red jack who claimed to be god jack the ripper and many others he sought to make rhea his bride the new doom patrol followed jack into his house which our world is a room in as he battled the doom patrol rhea awoke from her coma and stabbed jack in the back then immediately became comatose again brought back to the doom patrol s new mountainside headquarters niles caulder the chief did experiments on rhea showing that her coma wasn t normal she was instead going through a form of metamorphosis and her human form is the chrysalis rhea awoke from her coma in issue 36 during the orthodoxy geomancer war it was revealed that she was the pupa a weapon sought by the aliens orthodoxy and geomancers rhea s original body shattered and out emerged a magnetic butterfly explaining why she was sought out by red jack after awaking her facial features disappeared and her eyes were now on her chest and back her ears had also become two twinkling lights she no longer wears clothes and seems to think nothing of it rhea was actually what some call a lodestone a

wikidata a brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals it is located in the head usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision it is the most complex organ in a vertebrate s body in a human the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14 16 billion neurons 1 and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55 70 billion 2 each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons these neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells physiologically brains exert centralized control over a body s other organs they act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones this centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain the operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved 3 recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer very different in mechanism from an electronic computer but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world stores it and processes it in a variety of ways this article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species with the greatest attention to vertebrates it deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains the ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context the most important that are

external links anatomy cross section of the olfactory bulb of a rat stained in two different ways at the same time one stain shows neuron cell bodies the other shows receptors for the neurotransmitter gaba the shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species and identifying common features is often difficult 4 nevertheless there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species 5 some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species 6 others distinguish advanced brains from more primitive ones or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates 4 the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives and then sliced apart for examination of the interior visually the interior of the brain consists of areas of so called grey matter with a dark color separated by areas of white matter with a lighter color further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another 7 cellular structure neurons generate electrical signals that travel along their axons when a pulse of electricity reaches a junction called a synapse it causes a neurotransmitter chemical to be released which binds to receptors on other cells and thereby alters their electrical activity the brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells neurons and glial cells glial cells also known as glia or neuroglia come in several types and perform a number of critical functions including structural support metabolic support insulation and guidance of development neurons however are usually considered the most important cells in the brain 8 the property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances 8 they send these signals by means of an axon which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects usually with numerous branches to other areas sometimes nearby sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body the length of an axon can be extraordinary for example if a pyramidal cell an excitatory neuron of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body its axon equally magnified would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter extending more than a kilometer 9 these axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1 100 meters per second some neurons emit action potentials constantly at rates of 10 100 per second usually in irregular patterns other neurons are quiet most of the time but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials 10 axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called synapses a single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells 8 when an action potential traveling along an axon arrives at a synapse it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released the neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell 8 synapses are the key functional elements of the brain 11 the essential function of the brain is cell to cell communication and synapses are the points at which communication occurs the human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses 12 even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million 13 the functions of these synapses are very diverse some are excitatory exciting the target cell others are inhibitory others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways 11 a large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable that is they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them it is widely believed that activity dependent modification of synapses is the brain s primary mechanism for learning and memory 11 most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons which are often bundled together in what are called nerve fiber tracts a myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of myelin which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation there are also unmyelinated axons myelin is white making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light colored white matter in contrast to the darker colored grey matter that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies 8 evolution main article evolution of the brain generic bilaterian nervous system nervous system of a generic bilaterian animal in the form of a nerve cord with segmental enlargements and a brain at the front except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges which have no nervous system 14 and cnidarians which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net 14 all living multicellular animals are bilaterians meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape that is left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other 15 all bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared late in the cryogenian period 700 650 million years ago and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body 15 at a schematic level that basic worm shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians including vertebrates 16 the fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus and a nerve cord with an enlargement a ganglion for each body segment with an especially large ganglion at the front called the brain the brain is small and simple in some species such as nematode worms in other species including vertebrates it is the most complex organ in the body 4 some types of worms such as leeches also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord known as a tail brain 17 there are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain including echinoderms and tunicates it has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest bilaterians lacked a brain or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure invertebrates fruit flies drosophila have been extensively studied to gain insight into the role of genes in brain development this category includes tardigrades arthropods molluscs and numerous types of worms the diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures 18 two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains arthropods insects crustaceans arachnids and others and cephalopods octopuses squids and similar molluscs 19 the brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal arthropods have a central brain the supraesophageal ganglion with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing 19 cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates 20 there are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work fruit flies drosophila because of the large array of techniques available for studying their genetics have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development 21 in spite of the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals many aspects of drosophila neurogenetics have been shown to be relevant to humans the first biological clock genes for example were identified by examining drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles 22 a search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well 23 studies done on drosophila also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions 24 the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans like drosophila has been studied largely because of its importance in genetics 25 in the early 1970s sydney brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development one of the advantages of working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons always in the same places making identical synaptic connections in every worm 26 brenner s team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope then visually matched fibers from section to section to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body 27 the complete neuronal wiring diagram of c elegans its connectome was achieved 28 nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible 29 the sea slug aplysia californica was chosen by nobel prize winning neurophysiologist eric kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory because of the simplicity and accessibility of its nervous system and it has been examined in hundreds of experiments 30 vertebrates the brain of a shark the first vertebrates appeared over 500 million years ago mya during the cambrian period and may have resembled the modern hagfish in form 31 jawed fish appeared by 445 mya amphibians by 350 mya reptiles by 310 mya and mammals by 200 mya approximately each species has an equally long evolutionary history but the brains of modern hagfishes lampreys sharks amphibians reptiles and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence all of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components but many are rudimentary in the hagfish whereas in mammals the foremost part the telencephalon is greatly elaborated and expanded 32 brains are most simply compared in terms of their size the relationship between brain size body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species as a rule brain size increases with body size but not in a simple linear proportion in general smaller animals tend to have larger brains measured as a fraction of body size for mammals the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a power law with an exponent of about 0 75 33 this formula describes the central tendency but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior for example primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts predators tend to have larger brains than their prey relative to body size 34 the main subdivisions of the embryonic vertebrate brain left which later differentiate into structures of the adult brain right all vertebrate brains share a common underlying form which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development in its earliest form the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the neural tube these swellings eventually become the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain the prosencephalon mesencephalon and rhombencephalon respectively at the earliest stages of brain development the three areas are roughly equal in size in many classes of vertebrates such as fish and amphibians the three parts remain similar in size in the adult but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts and the midbrain becomes very small 8 the brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue 8 living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside with subtle variations in color vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers the cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another forming the blood brain barrier which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens 35 though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain 36 neuroanatomists usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions the telencephalon cerebral hemispheres diencephalon thalamus and hypothalamus mesencephalon midbrain cerebellum pons and medulla oblongata each of these areas has a complex internal structure some parts such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space other parts such as the thalamus and hypothalamus consist of clusters of many small nuclei thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure chemistry and connectivity 8 the main anatomical regions of the vertebrate brain shown for shark and human the same parts are present but they differ greatly in size and shape although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry especially in the forebrain area the brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way but in teleost fishes the great majority of existing fish species the forebrain has become everted like a sock turned inside out in birds there are also major changes in forebrain structure 37 these distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species 38 here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood see also list of regions in the human brain the medulla along with the spinal cord contains many small nuclei involved in a wide variety of sensory and involuntary motor functions such as vomiting heart rate and digestive processes 8 the pons lies in the brainstem directly above the medulla among other things it contains nuclei that control often voluntary but simple acts such as sleep respiration swallowing bladder function equilibrium eye movement facial expressions and posture 39 the hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain whose complexity and importance belies its size it is composed of numerous small nuclei each with distinct connections and neurochemistry the hypothalamus is engaged in additional involuntary or partially voluntary acts such as sleep and wake cycles eating and drinking and the release of some hormones 40 the thalamus is a collection of nuclei with diverse functions some are involved in relaying information to and from the cerebral hemispheres while others are involved in motivation the subthalamic area zona incerta seems to contain action generating systems for several types of consummatory behaviors such as eating drinking defecation and copulation 41 the cerebellum modulates the outputs of other brain systems whether motor related or thought related to make them certain and precise removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy this precision is not built in but learned by trial and error the muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle is an example of a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum 8 10 of the brain s total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50 of all neurons are held within its structure 42 the optic tectum allows actions to be directed toward points in space most commonly in response to visual input in mammals it is usually referred to as the superior colliculus and its best studied function is to direct eye movements it also directs reaching movements and other object directed actions it receives strong visual inputs but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes in some primitive fishes such as lampreys this region is the largest part of the brain 43 the superior colliculus is part of the midbrain the pallium is a layer of grey matter that lies on the surface of the forebrain and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ 44 in reptiles and mammals it is called the cerebral cortex multiple functions involve the pallium including smell and spatial memory in mammals where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain it takes over functions from many other brain areas in many mammals the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci the folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed 45 the hippocampus strictly speaking is found only in mammals however the area it derives from the medial pallium has counterparts in all vertebrates there is evidence that this part of the brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes birds reptiles and mammals 46 the basal ganglia are a group of interconnected structures in the forebrain the primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection they send inhibitory signals to all parts of the brain that can generate motor behaviors and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition so that the action generating systems are able to execute their actions reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia 47 the olfactory bulb is a special structure that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium it is a major brain component in many vertebrates but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell 48 reptiles birds main article avian brain mammals the most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size on average a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size 49 size however is not the only difference there are also substantial differences in shape the hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure 50 the cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals in non mammalian vertebrates the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three layered structure called the pallium in mammals the pallium evolves into a complex six layered structure called neocortex or isocortex 51 several areas at the edge of the neocortex including the hippocampus and amygdala are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates 50 the elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas the superior colliculus which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates shrinks to a small size in mammals and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex 49 the cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion the neocerebellum dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex which has no counterpart in other vertebrates 52 primates encephalization quotient species eq 53 human 7 4 7 8 common chimpanzee 2 2 2 5 rhesus monkey 2 1 bottlenose dolphin 4 14 54 elephant 1 13 2 36 55 dog 1 2 horse 0 9 rat 0 4 see also human brain the brains of humans and other primates contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals but are generally larger in proportion to body size 56 the encephalization quotient eq is used to compare brain sizes across species it takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain to body relationship 53 humans have an average eq in the 7 to 8 range while most other primates have an eq in the 2 to 3 range dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans 54 but nearly all other mammals have eq values that are substantially lower most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision 57 the visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas with a complex web of interconnections it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex 58 the prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning working memory motivation attention and executive control it takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species and an especially large fraction of the human brain 59 development main article neural development brain of a human embryo in the sixth week of development the brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages 60 it changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages to a complex array of areas and connections neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations once neurons have positioned themselves their axons sprout and navigate through the brain branching and extending as they go until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections in a number of parts of the nervous system neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages and then the unneeded ones are pruned away 60 for vertebrates the early stages of neural development are similar across all species 60 as the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate the precursor of the nervous system the neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube a hollow cord of cells with a fluid filled ventricle at the center at the front end the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the prosencephalon forebrain mesencephalon midbrain and rhombencephalon hindbrain at the next stage the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon which will contain the cerebral cortex basal ganglia and related structures and the diencephalon which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus at about the same time the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon which will contain the cerebellum and pons and the myelencephalon which will contain the medulla oblongata each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated the resulting cells then migrate sometimes for long distances to their final positions 60 once a neuron is in place it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it axons because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets grow in a particularly complex way the tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone studded with chemical receptors these receptors sense the local environment causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path the result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses considering the entire brain thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding 60 the synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes though in many parts of the brain axons initially overgrow and then are pruned by mechanisms that depend on neural activity 60 in the projection from the eye to the midbrain for example the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer in the first stages of development each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons the retina before birth contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer these waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time that is they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons this information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken and eventually vanish if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell the result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map leaving it finally in its precise adult form 61 similar things happen in other brain areas an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance but then gradually refined by activity dependent mechanisms partly driven by internal dynamics partly by external sensory inputs in some cases as with the retina midbrain system activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain and apparently exist solely to guide development 61 in humans and many other mammals new neurons are created mainly before birth and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain 60 there are however a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life the two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the olfactory bulb which is involved in the sense of smell and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories with these exceptions however the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life glial cells are different as with most types of cells in the body they are generated throughout the lifespan 62 there has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind personality and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing this is the nature and nurture controversy 63 although many details remain to be settled neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important genes determine the general form of the brain and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience experience however is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does in some respects all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development 64 in other respects the quantity and quality of experience are important for example there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices indicating a higher density of synaptic connections than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted 65 physiology the functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells the electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses 8 neurotransmitters and receptors neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when the local membrane is depolarised and ca2 enters into the cell typically when an action potential arrives at the synapse neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse s target cell or cells and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules with few exceptions each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter or combination of neurotransmitters at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons this rule is known as dale s principle 8 thus a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases the great majority of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems this applies to drugs such as cannabinoids nicotine heroin cocaine alcohol fluoxetine chlorpromazine and many others 66 the two neurotransmitters that are most widely found in the vertebrate brain are glutamate which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons and gamma aminobutyric acid gaba which is almost always inhibitory neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain 67 because of their ubiquity drugs that act on glutamate or gaba tend to have broad and powerful effects some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of gaba 68 there are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain often areas dedicated to a particular function serotonin for example the primary target of many antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the raphe nuclei 69 norepinephrine which is involved in arousal comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the locus coeruleus 70 other neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine have multiple sources in the brain but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and gaba 71 electrical activity brain electrical activity recorded from a human patient during an epileptic seizure as a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active when large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull using electroencephalography eeg 72 or magnetoencephalography meg eeg recordings along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active even during sleep 73 each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity which may vary according to behavioral state in mammals the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive and chaotic looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task called beta and gamma waves during an epileptic seizure the brain s inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels producing eeg traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain relating these population level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology 73 metabolism all vertebrates have a blood brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons including levels of ions and nutrients 74 brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals the need to limit body weight in order for example to fly has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species such as bats 75 most of the brain s energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge membrane potential of neurons 74 most vertebrate species devote between 2 and 8 of basal metabolism to the brain in primates however the percentage is much higher in humans it rises to 20 25 76 the energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods of pet fmri 77 and nirs 78 the brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen dependent metabolism of glucose i e blood sugar 74 but ketones provide a major alternative source together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids caprylic and heptanoic acids 79 80 lactate 81 acetate 82 and possibly amino acids 83 function model of a neural circuit in the cerebellum as proposed by james s albus information from the sense organs is collected in the brain there it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take the brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances finally on the basis of the results it generates motor response patterns these signal processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems 84 the function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal a centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co activated in complex patterns it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross purposes to each other 84 perception diagram of signal processing in the auditory system the human brain is provided with information about light sound the chemical composition of the atmosphere temperature the position of the body in space proprioception the chemical composition of the bloodstream and more in other animals additional senses are present such as the infrared heat sense of snakes the magnetic field sense of some birds or the electric field sense mainly seen in aquatic animals each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells 8 such as photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye or vibration sensitive hair cells in the cochlea of the ear the axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain where they transmit their signals to a first order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality this primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality eventually via a way station in the thalamus the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex where they are processed to extract the relevant features and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems 8 motor control motor systems are areas of the brain that are involved in initiating body movements that is in activating muscles except for the muscles that control the eye which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain 8 spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord and by inputs that descend from the brain the intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming the descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control 8 the brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord at the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons which control stereotyped movements such as walking breathing or swallowing at a higher level are areas in the midbrain such as the red nucleus which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs at a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe the primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord through the pyramidal tract this direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements other motor related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex supplementary motor area basal ganglia and cerebellum 8 in addition to all of the above the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the autonomic nervous system which controls the movement of the smooth muscle of the body 8 major areas involved in controlling movement area location function ventral horn spinal cord contains motor neurons that directly activate muscles 85 oculomotor nuclei midbrain contains motor neurons that directly activate the eye muscles 86 cerebellum hindbrain calibrates precision and timing of movements 8 basal ganglia forebrain action selection on the basis of motivation 87 motor cortex frontal lobe direct cortical activation of spinal motor circuits 88 premotor cortex frontal lobe groups elementary movements into coordinated patterns 8 supplementary motor area frontal lobe sequences movements into temporal patterns 89 prefrontal cortex frontal lobe planning and other executive functions 90 sleep main article sleep see also arousal many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas 8 a key component of the sleep system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the optic nerves from the two eyes cross the scn contains the body s central biological clock neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours circadian rhythms these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of clock genes the scn continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves through the retinohypothalamic tract rht that allows daily light dark cycles to calibrate the clock 91 the scn projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus brainstem and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep wake cycles an important component of the system is the reticular formation a group of neuron clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus which in turn sends activity level controlling signals to every part of the cortex damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma 8 sleep involves great changes in brain activity 8 until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep 92 but this is now known to be far from true activity continues but patterns become very different there are two types of sleep rem sleep with dreaming and nrem non rem usually without dreaming sleep which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured rem light nrem and deep nrem during deep nrem sleep also called slow wave sleep activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep and fall almost to zero during rem sleep levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern 8 homeostasis cross section of a human head showing location of the hypothalamus for any animal survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation these include temperature water content salt concentration in the bloodstream blood glucose levels blood oxygen level and others 93 the ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body the milieu intérieur as the pioneering physiologist claude bernard called it is known as homeostasis greek for standing still 94 maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain the basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback any time a parameter diverges from its set point sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value 93 this principle is widely used in engineering for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat in vertebrates the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the hypothalamus a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function 93 the hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei most of which are involved in basic biological functions some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality aggression or maternal behaviors but many of them relate to homeostasis several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels conveying information about temperature sodium level glucose level blood oxygen level and other parameters these hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus the pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity 95 motivation components of the basal ganglia shown in two cross sections of the human brain blue caudate nucleus and putamen green globus pallidus red subthalamic nucleus black substantia nigra the individual animals need to express survival promoting behaviors such as seeking food water shelter and a mate 96 the motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise the motivational system works largely by a reward punishment mechanism when a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences the reward mechanism in the brain is activated which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later whenever a similar situation arises conversely when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences the brain s punishment mechanism is activated inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future 97 most organisms studied to date utilize a reward punishment mechanism for instance worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers 98 in vertebrates the reward punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain 47 the basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain when this inhibition is released a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision signals that are emitted the reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role addictive drugs such as cocaine amphetamine and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced 99 learning and memory almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience even the most primitive types of worms because behavior is driven by brain activity changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain already in the late 19th century theorists like santiago ramón y cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons 100 until 1970 however experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking in 1971 tim bliss and terje lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long term potentiation the paper showed clear evidence of activity induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days 101 since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change and uncovered other types of activity driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas including the cerebral cortex hippocampus basal ganglia and cerebellum 102 brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process 103 neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways working memory is the ability of the brain to maintain a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in this sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another 104 episodic memory is the ability to remember the details of specific events this sort of memory can last for a lifetime much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia that is inability to form new long lasting episodic memories 105 semantic memory is the ability to learn facts and relationships this sort of memory is probably stored largely in the cerebral cortex mediated by changes in connections between cells that represent specific types of information 106 instrumental learning is the ability for rewards and punishments to modify behavior it is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the basal ganglia 107 motor learning is the ability to refine patterns of body movement by practicing or more generally by repetition a number of brain areas are involved including the premotor cortex basal ganglia and especially the cerebellum which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement 108 research main article neuroscience brain research redirects here for the scientific journal see brain research the human brain project is a large scientific research project starting in 2013 which aims to simulate the complete human brain the field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system 8 psychology seeks to understand mind and behavior and neurology is the medical discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system the brain is also the most important organ studied in psychiatry the branch of medicine that works to study prevent and treat mental disorders 109 cognitive science seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain such as computer science artificial intelligence and similar fields and philosophy 110 the oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical and until the middle of the 20th century much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes neuroanatomists study the large scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components especially synapses among other tools they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure chemistry and connectivity in recent years the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes also functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior 111 neurophysiologists study the chemical pharmacological and electrical properties of the brain their primary tools are drugs and recording devices thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system some in highly specific ways recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes either glued to the scalp as in eeg studies or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons 112 because the brain does not contain pain receptors it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress the same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients with intractable epilepsy in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures 113 functional imaging techniques such as fmri are also used to study brain activity these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive 114 design of an experiment in which brain activity from a monkey was used to control a robotic arm 115 another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas even though it is protected by the skull and meninges surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood brain barrier the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage in humans the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage however this information is often difficult to interpret in animal studies most commonly involving rats it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior 116 computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches first the use of computers to study the brain second the study of how brains perform computation on one hand it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity such simulations are known as biologically realistic neural networks on the other hand it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating or mathematically analyzing the operations of simplified units that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity the computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists 117 computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain 118 and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in neuroplasticity 103 the most common subjects are mice because of the availability of technical tools it is now possible with relative ease to knock out or mutate a wide variety of genes and then examine the effects on brain function more sophisticated approaches are also being used for example using cre lox recombination it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain at specific times 118 history illustration by rené descartes of how the brain implements a reflex response see also history of neuroscience the oldest brain to have been discovered was in armenia in the areni 1 cave complex the brain estimated to be over 5 000 years old was found in the skull of a 12 to 14 year old girl although the brains were shriveled they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave 119 early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart aristotle favored the heart and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood democritus the inventor of the atomic theory of matter argued for a three part soul with intellect in the head emotion in the heart and lust near the liver 120 the unknown author of on the sacred disease a medical treatise in the hippocratic corpus came down unequivocally in favor of the brain writing men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys delights laughter and sports and sorrows griefs despondency and lamentations and by the same organ we become mad and delirious and fears and terrors assail us some by night and some by day and dreams and untimely wanderings and cares that are not suitable and ignorance of present circumstances desuetude and unskillfulness all these things we endure from the brain when it is not healthy on the sacred disease attributed to hippocrates 121 andreas vesalius fabrica published in 1543 showing the base of the human brain including optic chiasma cerebellum olfactory bulbs etc the roman physician galen also argued for the importance of the brain and theorized in some depth about how it might work galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain nerves and muscles demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves he postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon usually translated as animal spirits 120 galen s ideas were widely known during the middle ages but not much further progress came until the renaissance when detailed anatomical study resumed combined with the theoretical speculations of rené descartes and those who followed him descartes like galen thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms he believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non physical res cogitans but that the majority of behaviors of humans and all behaviors of animals could be explained mechanistically 120 the first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function though came from the investigations of luigi galvani 1737 1798 who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract since that time each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation until the early years of the 20th century the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells 122 particularly critical was the invention of the golgi stain which when correctly used stains only a small fraction of neurons but stains them in their entirety including cell body dendrites and axon without such a stain brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers in which it is impossible to determine any structure in the hands of camillo golgi and especially of the spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramón y cajal the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity 123 drawing by santiago ramón y cajal of two types of golgi stained neurons from the cerebellum of a pigeon in the first half of the 20th century advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells culminating in work by alan hodgkin andrew huxley and others on the biophysics of the action potential and the work of bernard katz and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse 124 these studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity reflecting the new understanding in 1942 charles sherrington visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep the great topmost sheet of the mass that where hardly a light had twinkled or moved becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither the brain is waking and with it the mind is returning it is as if the milky way entered upon some cosmic dance swiftly the head mass becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one a shifting harmony of subpatterns sherrington 1942 man on his nature 125 the invention of electronic computers in the 1940s along with the development of mathematical information theory led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems this concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience 126 the earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise as for example in john von neumann s 1958 book the computer and the brain 127 over the years though accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism 126 one of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled what the frog s eye tells the frog s brain the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the retina and optic tectum of frogs and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as bug perceivers 128 a few years later david hubel and torsten wiesel discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view a discovery for which they won a nobel prize 129 follow up studies in higher order visual areas found cells that detect binocular disparity color movement and aspects of shape with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses 130 other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates some related to memory some to abstract types of cognition such as space 131 theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical models of neurons and neural networks which can be simulated using computers 126 some useful models are abstract focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons 132 no model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function though the essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time 133 furthermore even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations 134 so brain models that don t reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources however the human brain project is trying to build a realistic detailed computational model of the entire human brain the wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested with high profile scientists on both sides of the argument in the second half of the 20th century developments in chemistry electron microscopy genetics computer science functional brain imaging and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function in the united states the 1990s were officially designated as the decade of the brain to commemorate advances made in brain research and to promote funding for such research 135 in the 21st century these trends have continued and several new approaches have come into prominence including multielectrode recording which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time 136 genetic engineering which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally 118 genomics which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in dna properties and neuroimaging 137 society and culture as food main article brain as food gulai otak beef brain curry from indonesia animal brains are used as food in numerous cuisines in rituals some archaeological evidence suggests that the mourning rituals of european neanderthals also involved the consumption of the brain 138 the fore people of papua new guinea are known to eat human brains in funerary rituals those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality a prion

or humble bee is any of over 250 species in the genus bombus part of apidae one of the bee families this genus is the only extant group in the tribe bombini though a few extinct related genera e g calyptapis are known from fossils they are found primarily in higher altitudes or latitudes in the northern hemisphere although they are also found in south america where a few lowland tropical species have been identified european bumblebees have also been introduced to new zealand and tasmania female bumblebees can sting repeatedly but generally ignore humans and other animals most bumblebees are social insects that form colonies with a single queen the colonies are smaller than those of honey bees growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest cuckoo bumblebees are brood parasitic and do not make nests or form colonies their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs which are cared for by the resident workers cuckoo bumblebees were previously classified as a separate genus but are now usually treated as members of bombus bumblebees have round bodies covered in soft hair long branched setae called pile making them appear and feel fuzzy they have aposematic warning coloration often consisting of contrasting bands of colour and different species of bumblebee in a region often resemble each other in mutually protective müllerian mimicry harmless insects such as hoverflies often derive protection from resembling bumblebees in batesian mimicry and may be confused with them nest making bumblebees can be distinguished from similarly large fuzzy cuckoo bees by the form of the female hind leg in nesting bumblebees it is modified to form a pollen basket a bare shiny area surrounded by a fringe of hairs used to transport pollen whereas in cuckoo bees the hind leg is hairy all round and they never carry pollen like their relatives the honeybees bumblebees feed on nectar using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid the proboscis is folded under the head during flight bumblebees gather nectar to add to the stores in the nest and pollen to feed their young they forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from some bumblebees steal nectar making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators so their decline in europe north america and asia is a cause for concern the decline has been caused by habitat loss the mechanisation of agriculture and

10 notes 11 references 12 sources 13 external links etymology and common names beatrix potter s 1910 story the tale of mrs tittlemouse features a bumble bee called babbity bumble the word bumblebee is a compound of bumble and bee bumble meaning to hum buzz drone or move ineptly or flounderingly 1 the generic name bombus assigned by pierre andré latreille in 1802 is derived from the latin word for a buzzing or humming sound borrowed from ancient greek βόμβος bómbos 2 according to the oxford english dictionary oed the term bumblebee was first recorded as having been used in the english language in the 1530 work lesclarcissement by john palsgrave i bomme as a bombyll bee dothe 3 however the oed also states that the term humblebee predates it having first been used in 1450 in fysshynge wyth angle in juyll the greshop the humbylbee in the medow 4 the latter term was used in a midsummer night s dream c 1600 by william shakespeare the honie bags steale from the humble bees 5 similar terms are used in other germanic languages such as the german hummel old high german humbala 6 dutch hommel or swedish humla an old provincial name dumbledor also denoted a buzzing insect such as a bumblebee or cockchafer dumble probably imitating the sound of these insects while dor meant beetle 7 in on the origin of species 1859 charles darwin speculated about humble bees and their interactions with other species 8 i have reason to believe that humble bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease viola tricolor for other bees do not visit this flower from experiments which i have tried i have found that the visits of bees if not indispensable are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers but humble bees alone visit the common red clover trifolium pratense as other bees cannot reach the nectar however bumblebee remained in use for example in the tale of mrs tittlemouse 1910 by beatrix potter suddenly round a corner she met babbitty bumble zizz bizz bizzz said the bumble bee since world war ii humblebee has fallen into near total disuse 9 phylogeny the bumblebee tribe bombini is one of four groups of corbiculate bees those with pollen baskets in the apidae the others being the apini honey bees euglossini orchid bees and meliponini stingless bees the corbiculate bees are a monophyletic group advanced eusocial behaviour appears to have evolved twice in the group giving rise to controversy now largely settled as to the phylogenetic origins of the four tribes it had been supposed that eusocial behaviour had evolved only once requiring the apini to be close to the meliponini which they do not resemble it is now thought that the apini with advanced societies and euglossini are closely related while the primitively eusocial bombini are close to the meliponini which have somewhat more advanced eusocial behaviour sophie cardinal and bryan danforth comment that while remarkable a hypothesis of dual origins of advanced eusociality is congruent with early studies on corbiculate morphology and social behavior 10 their analysis combining molecular morphological and behavioural data gives the following cladogram 10 corbiculate bees apini honeybees euglossini orchid bees bombini bumblebees meliponini stingless bees bombus pristinus described in 1867 calyptapis florissantensis eocene florissant formation on this hypothesis the molecular data suggest that the bombini are 25 to 40 million years old while the meliponini and thus the clade that includes the bombini and meliponini are 81 to 96 million years old about the same age as the corbiculate group 10 however a more recent phylogeny using transcriptome data from 3 647 genes of ten corbiculate bee species supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis in the corbiculate bees 11 they find that bombini is in fact sister to meliponini corroborating that previous finding from sophie cardinal and bryan danforth 2011 however romiguier et al 2015 shows that bombini meliponini and apini form a monophyletic group where apini shares a most recent common ancestor with the bombini and meliponini clade while euglossini is most distantly related to all three since it does not share the same most recent common ancestor as bombini meliponini and apini thus their analysis supports the single origin of eusociality hypothesis within the corbiculate bees where eusociality evolved in the common ancestor of bombini apini and meliponini the fossil record for bees is limited with around 14 species that might possibly be bombini having been described by 2019 the only bombus relatives in bombini are the late eocene calyptapis florissantensis from the florissant formation usa and oligobombus cuspidatus from the bembridge marls of the isle of wight 12 13 two species of bombus have been described from the oligocene of beşkonak bucak turkey bombus mendacibombus beskonakensis 14 and bombus paraelectrobombus patriciae both species were originally placed in genera considered at the time of description as outside of bombus being initially named oligoapis beskonakensis and paraelectrobombus patriciae respectively however reexaminiation of the fore wings lead to both being considered as bombus species 15 in 2012 a fossil bumblebee from the miocene was found in germany s randeck maar and classified as bombus bombus randeckensis 14 in 2014 another species bombus cerdanyensis was described from late miocene lacustrine beds of la cerdanya spain but not initially placed into any subgenus 16 the species bombus trophonius was described in october 2017 and placed in bombus subgenus cullumanobombus 17 a redescription of the bombini fossil record by dehon et al 2019 resulted in the synonymization of the genus oligoapis with bombus subgenus mendacibombus and the placement of genus paraelectrobombus as bombus subgenus paraelectrobombus rather than as a genus in electrobombini the subgenus cullumanobombus was expanded to include not only bombus trophonius but also bombus randeckensis which was moved from subgenus bombus and bombus pristinus first described by unger 1867 within the subgenus melanobombus only bombus cerdanyensis is present from the fossil record an additional three species bombus luianus bombus anacolus and bombus dilectus have been attributed to bombus from the middle miocene shanwang formation of china by zhang 1990 and zhang et al 1994 due to not being able to study zhang s type specimens but only illustrations of the fossils dehon et al did not place the three species within any specific subgenera and considered all three as species inquirenda needing fuller re examination two other species were not examined at all by dehon et al bombus crassipes of the late miocene krottensee deposits in the czech republic and bombus proavus from the middle miocene latah formation usa 15 taxonomy further information list of bumblebee species the genus bombus the only one extant genus in the tribe bombini comprises over 250 species 18 for an overview of the differences between bumblebees and other bees and wasps see characteristics of common wasps and bees the genus has been divided variously into up to 49 subgenera a degree of complexity criticised by williams 2008 19 the cuckoo bumblebees psithyrus have sometimes been treated as a separate genus but are now considered to be part of bombus in one or more subgenera 19 examples of bombus species include bombus pauloensis bombus dahlbomii bombus fervidus bombus lapidarius bombus ruderatus and bombus rupestris bombus genus mendacibombus 12 species bombias 3 species kallobombus 1 species orientalibombus 3 species subterraneobombus 10 species megabombus 22 species thoracobombus 50 species psithyrus 30 species pyrobombus 50 species alpinobombus 5 species bombus subgenus 5 species alpigenobombus 7 species melanobombus 17 species sibiricobombus 7 species cullumanobombus 23 species subgenera of the genus bombus general description further information characteristics of common wasps and bees bumblebees vary in appearance but are generally plump and densely furry they are larger broader and stouter bodied than honeybees and their abdomen tip is more rounded many species have broad bands of colour the patterns helping to distinguish different species whereas honeybees have short tongues and therefore mainly pollinate open flowers some bumblebee species have long tongues and collect nectar from flowers that are closed into a tube 20 bumblebees have fewer stripes or none and usually have part of the body covered in black fur while honeybees have many stripes including several grey stripes on the abdomen 21 sizes are very variable even within species the largest british species b terrestris has queens up to 22 mm 0 9 in long males up to 16 mm 0 6 in long and workers between 11 and 17 mm 0 4 0 7 in long 22 the largest bumblebee species in the world is b dahlbomii of chile up to about 40 mm 1 6 in long and described as flying mice and a monstrous fluffy ginger beast 23 distribution and habitat bumblebees are typically found in temperate climates and are often found at higher latitudes and altitudes than other bees although a few lowland tropical species exist 24 a few species b polaris and b alpinus range into very cold climates where other bees might not be found b polaris occurs in northern ellesmere island in the high arctic along with another bumblebee b hyperboreus which parasitises its nest this is the northernmost occurrence of any eusocial insect 25 one reason for their presence in cold places is that bumblebees can regulate their body temperature via solar radiation internal mechanisms of shivering and radiative cooling from the abdomen called heterothermy other bees have similar physiology but the mechanisms seem best developed and have been most studied in bumblebees 26 they adapt to higher elevations by extending their wing stroke amplitude 27 bumblebees have a largely cosmopolitan distribution but are absent from australia apart from tasmania where they have been introduced and are found in africa only north of the sahara 28 more than a hundred years ago they were also introduced to new zealand where they play an important role as efficient pollinators citation needed biology a common carder bumblebee bombus pascuorum extending its tongue towards a heuchera inflorescence feeding the bumblebee tongue the proboscis is a long hairy structure that extends from a sheath like modified maxilla the primary action of the tongue is lapping that is repeated dipping of the tongue into liquid 29 the tip of the tongue probably acts as a suction cup and during lapping nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action when at rest or flying the proboscis is kept folded under the head the longer the tongue the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn from experience which flower source is best suited to their tongue length 30 bees with shorter proboscides like bombus bifarius have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides to overcome this disadvantage b bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct which resulted in a small reward 31 wax production the exoskeleton of the abdomen is divided into plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff it is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers it is scraped from the abdomen by the legs moulded until malleable and used in the construction of honeypots to cover the eggs to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest 32 coloration cuckoo bumblebees like this bombus barbutellus have similar aposematic warning coloration to nest making bumblebees and may also mimic their host species further information aposematism and mimicry the brightly coloured pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic warning signal given that females can inflict a painful sting depending on the species and morph the warning colours range from entirely black to bright yellow red orange white and pink 33 dipteran flies in the families syrphidae hoverflies asilidae robber flies tabanidae horseflies oestridae bot or warble flies and bombyliidae bee flies such as bombylius major all include batesian mimics of bumblebees resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators 34 many species of bombus including the group sometimes called psithyrus cuckoo bumblebees have evolved müllerian mimicry where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once for example in california a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including b californicus b caliginosus b vandykei b vosnesenskii b insularis and b fernaldae other bees in california include a group of species all banded black and yellow in each case müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage 34 in addition parasitic cuckoo bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance at least in areas like europe where parasite host co speciation is common but this too may be explained as müllerian mimicry rather than requiring the parasite s coloration to deceive the host aggressive mimicry 35 temperature control bumblebees are active under conditions during which honeybees stay at home and can readily absorb heat from even weak sunshine 36 the thick pile created by long setae bristles acts as insulation to keep bumblebees warm in cold weather species from cold climates have longer setae and thus thicker insulation than those from the tropics 37 the temperature of the flight muscles which occupy much of the thorax needs to be at least 30 c 86 f before flight can take place the muscle temperature can be raised by shivering it takes about five minutes for the muscles to reach this temperature at an air temperature of 13 c 55 f 38 chill coma temperature the chill coma temperature in relation to flying insects is the temperature at which flight muscles cannot be activated compared to honey bees and carpenter bees bumblebees have the lowest chill coma temperature of the bumblebees bombus bimaculatus has the lowest at 7 c 45 f however bumblebees have been seen to fly in colder ambient temperatures this discrepancy is likely because the chill coma temperature was determined by tests done in a laboratory setting however bumblebees live in insulated shelters and can shiver to warm up before venturing into the cold 39 communication and social learning bumblebees do not have ears and it is not known whether or how well they can hear however they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials 32 bumblebees do not exhibit the bee dances used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources instead when they return from a successful foraging expedition they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more these bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings which may stimulate other bees to start foraging 40 another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots and when little is left or when high quality food is added they are more likely to go out to forage 41 bumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning in a 2017 study involving bombus terrestris bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward bees who first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees who observed the same action performed by a magnet indicating the importance of social information the bees did not copy one another exactly in fact the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate one another s goals 42 43 reproduction and nesting nest of red tailed bumblebee bombus lapidarius showing wax pots full of honey further information haplodiploidy and worker policing nest size depends on species of bumblebee most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals 44 but colonies have been documented as small as 20 individuals and as large as 1700 45 these nests are small compared to honeybee hives which hold about 50 000 bees many species nest underground choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating other species make nests above ground whether in thick grass or in holes in trees a bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee the cells are instead clustered together untidily the workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance helping to prevent disease nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter 44 in the early spring the queen comes out of diapause and finds a suitable place to create her colony then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year the eggs that hatch develop into female workers and in time the queen populates the colony with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers in temperate zones young queens gynes leave the nest in the autumn and mate often more than once with males drones that are forcibly driven out of the colony 46 the drones and workers die as the weather turns colder the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter they survive in a resting state diapause generally below ground until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is among the first to emerge 46 47 48 many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle 49 for this species the cycle begins in february reproduction starts in july or august and ends in the winter months the queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest 50 bumblebee life cycle showing adults and larvae in nest of b terrestris engraved in 1840 by william home lizars after drawing probably by james hope stewart 51 in fertilised queens the ovaries only become active when the queen starts to lay an egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca in which the sperm from the mating is stored depending on need she may allow her egg to be fertilised unfertilised eggs become haploid males fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens 52 the hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees while the queen remains dominant 46 to develop the larvae must be fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein bumblebees feed nectar to the larvae by chewing a small hole in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar larvae are fed pollen in one of two ways depending on the bumblebee species pocket making bumblebees create pockets of pollen at the base of the brood cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves pollen storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae 53 an above ground nest hidden in grass and moss of the common carder bee bombus pascuorum the wax canopy or involucrum has been removed to show winged workers and pupae in irregularly placed wax cells after the emergence of the first or second group of offspring workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring for larvae the colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens 46 bumblebee workers can lay unfertilised haploid eggs with only a single set of chromosomes that develop into viable male bumblebees only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs one set of chromosomes from a drone one from the queen that mature into workers and new queens 54 in a young colony the queen minimises reproductive competition from workers by suppressing their egg laying through physical aggression and pheromones 55 worker policing leads to nearly all eggs laid by workers being eaten 56 thus the queen is usually the mother of all of the first males laid workers eventually begin to lay male eggs later in the season when the queen s ability to suppress their reproduction diminishes 57 because of the reproductive competition between workers and the queen bumblebees are considered primitively eusocial 10 56 although a large majority of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen some select bombus species such as bombus pauloensis will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny 58 foraging behaviour further information bumblebee communication and nectar robbing a bumblebee loaded with pollen in its pollen baskets bumblebees generally visit flowers that exhibit the bee pollination syndrome and these patches of flowers may be up to 1 2 km from their colony 59 they tend to visit the same patches of flowers every day as long as they continue to find nectar and pollen there 60 a habit known as pollinator or flower constancy while foraging bumblebees can reach ground speeds of up to 15 m s 54 km h 61 bumblebees use a combination of colour and spatial relationships to learn which flowers to forage from 62 they can also detect both the presence and the pattern of electric fields on flowers which occur due to atmospheric electricity and take a while to leak away into the ground they use this information to find out if a flower has been recently visited by another bee 63 bumblebees can detect the temperature of flowers 64 as well as which parts of the flower are hotter or cooler 65 and use this information to recognise flowers after arriving at a flower they extract nectar using their long tongues glossae and store it in their crops many species of bumblebees also exhibit nectar robbing instead of inserting the mouthparts into the flower in the normal way these bees bite directly through the base of the corolla to extract nectar avoiding pollen transfer 66 biting open the stem of a flower and using its tongue to drink the nectar a bumblebee nectar robbing a flower pollen is removed from flowers deliberately or incidentally by bumblebees incidental removal occurs when bumblebees come in contact with the anthers of a flower while collecting nectar when it enters a flower the bumblebee s body hairs receive a dusting of pollen from the anthers in queens and workers this is then groomed into the corbiculae pollen baskets on the hind legs where it can be seen as bulging masses that may contain as many as a million pollen grains male bumblebees do not have corbiculae and do not purposively collect pollen 67 bumblebees are also capable of buzz pollination in which they dislodge pollen from the anthers by creating a resonant vibration with their flight muscles 68 in at least some species once a bumblebee has visited a flower it leaves a scent mark on it this scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades 69 this scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations e g nest neutral and food sites 70 and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers 71 and may be able to identify who else has visited a flower 72 bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time that is where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower 73 once they have collected nectar and pollen female workers return to the nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells or into wax cells for storage unlike honeybees bumblebees only store a few days worth of food so are much more vulnerable to food shortages 74 male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves they may visit quite different flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs 75 asynchronous flight muscles bees beat their wings about 200 times a second their thorax muscles do not contract on each nerve firing but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band this is efficient since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency leading to low energy consumption further it is necessary since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second 76 these types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles 77 and are found in the insect wing systems in families such as hymenoptera diptera coleoptera and hemiptera 76 bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures bumblebees can reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30 c 86 f using this method 26 78 cuckoo bumblebees the cuckoo bumblebee b vestalis a parasite of b terrestris main article psithyrus bumblebees of the subgenus psithyrus known as cuckoo bumblebees and formerly considered a separate genus are brood parasites 79 sometimes called kleptoparasites 80 in the colonies of other bumblebees and have lost the ability to collect pollen before finding and invading a host colony a psithyrus female such as that of the psithyrus species of b sylvestris 81 feeds directly from flowers once she has infiltrated a host colony the psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young 82 usually cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen intolerant inquilines since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring 79 though some species such as b bohemicus actually enjoy increased success when they leave the host queen alive 83 the female psithyrus has a number of morphological adaptations for combat such as larger mandibles a tough cuticle and a larger venom sac that increase her chances of taking over a nest 84 upon emerging from their cocoons the psithyrus males and females disperse and mate the males do not survive the winter but like nonparasitic bumblebee queens psithyrus females find suitable locations to spend the winter and enter diapause after mating they usually emerge from hibernation later than their host species each species of cuckoo bee has a specific host species which it may physically resemble 85 in the case of the parasitism of b terrestris by b psithyrus vestalis genetic analysis of individuals captured in the wild showed that about 42 of the host species nests at a single location a had lost their fight against their parasite 79 sting queen and worker bumblebees can sting unlike in honeybees a bumblebee s stinger lacks barbs so the bee can sting repeatedly without leaving the stinger in the wound and thereby injuring itself 86 87 bumblebee species are not normally aggressive but may sting in defence of their nest or if harmed female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members and sting the host queen but ignore other animals unless disturbed 88 the sting is painful to humans and not medically significant in most cases although it may trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals citation needed predators parasites and pathogens bumblebee nest dug up and destroyed by a predator probably a badger bumblebees despite their ability to sting are eaten by certain predators nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole including any adults present 89 adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in north america 90 in europe birds including bee eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers 91 bumblebee stored as food by a great grey shrike the great grey shrike is able to detect flying bumblebees up to 100 m 330 ft away once captured the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch 92 the european honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest digs out the nest with its feet and eats larvae pupae and adults as it finds them 93 bumblebees are parasitised by tracheal mites locustacarus buchneri protozoans including crithidia bombi and apicystis bombi and microsporidians including nosema bombi and nosema ceranae the tree bumblebee b hypnorum has spread into the united kingdom despite hosting high levels of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees attempts to establish colonies 94 deformed wing virus has been found to affect 11 of bumblebees in great britain 95 female bee moths aphomia sociella prefer to lay their eggs in bumblebee nests the a sociella larvae will then feed on the eggs larvae and pupae left unprotected by the bumblebees sometimes destroying large parts of the nest 96 relationship to humans bumblebees and human culture bombus anachoreta on a russian postage stamp 2005 agricultural use further information list of crop plants pollinated by bees bumblebees are important pollinators of both crops and wildflowers 97 because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony they do not stockpile honey and therefore are not useful as honey producers bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot 98 commercial production began in 1987 when roland de jonghe founded the biobest company in 1988 they produced enough nests to pollinate 40 hectares of tomatoes the industry grew quickly starting with other companies in the netherlands bumblebee nests mainly of buff tailed bumblebees are produced in at least 30 factories around the world over a million nests are grown annually in europe turkey is a major producer 99 bumblebees are northern hemisphere animals when red clover was introduced as a crop to new zealand in the nineteenth century it was found to have no local pollinators and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year four species of bumblebee from the united kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators in 1885 and 1886 the canterbury acclimatization society brought in 442 queens of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied as planned red clover was soon being produced from locally grown seed 36 bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses 52 the new zealand population of buff tailed bumblebees began colonising tasmania 1 500 miles 2 400 km away after being introduced there in 1992 under unclear circumstances 100 some concerns exist about the impact of the international trade in mass produced bumblebee colonies evidence from japan 101 and south america 102 indicates bumblebees can escape and naturalise in new environments causing damage to native pollinators greater use of native pollinators such as bombus ignitus in china and japan has occurred as a result 103 in addition mounting evidence indicates mass produced bumblebees may also carry diseases harmful to wild bumblebees 104 105 and honeybees 105 in canada and sweden it has been shown that growing a mosaic of different crops encourages bumblebees and provides higher yields than does a monoculture of oilseed rape despite the fact that the bees were attracted to the crop 106 population decline bumblebee species are declining in europe north america and asia due to a number of factors including land use change that reduces their food plants in north america pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus bombus 107 a major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the second world war small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts the horses were fed on clover and hay both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm little artificial fertiliser was used farms thus provided flowering clover and flower rich meadows favouring bumblebees mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses outcompeting the meadow flowers most of the flowers and the bumblebees that fed on them disappeared from britain by the early 1980s the last native british short haired bumblebee was captured near dungeness in 1988 108 this significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the genus bombus the bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers the species bombus hortorum in particular has been found to be affected by the pesticides their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected additionally pesticide use negatively affects colony development and size 109 bumblebees are in danger in many developed countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage the european food safety authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam presented a high risk for bees 110 while most work on neonicotinoid toxicity has looked at honeybees a study on b terrestris showed that field realistic levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85 implying a considerable negative effect on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world 111 however in another study following chronic exposure to field realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam colony weight gain was not affected nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced 112 low levels of neonicotinoids can reduce the number of bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55 and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees brains the bumblebee conservation trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks 113 a study on b terrestris had results that suggests that use of neonicotinoid pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with neonicotinoid 114 although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen they took a longer amount of time doing so 115 of 19 species of native nestmaking bumblebees and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in britain 116 three have been extirpated 117 118 eight are in serious decline and only six remain widespread 119 similar declines have been reported in ireland with four species designated endangered and another two considered vulnerable to extinction 120 a decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large scale changes to the countryside resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants 121 some bumblebees native to north america are also vanishing such as bombus balteatus 122 bombus terricola 123 bombus affinis 124 125 and bombus occidentalis and one bombus franklini may be extinct 126 in south america bombus bellicosus was extirpated in the northern limit of its distribution range probably due to intense land use and climate change effects 127 conservation efforts drone short haired bumblebee bombus subterraneus the species was successfully reintroduced to england from sweden in 2006 the bumblebee researcher dave goulson founded a registered charity the bumblebee conservation trust to prevent the extinction of any of the uk s bumblebees 128 129 in 2009 and 2010 the trust attempted to reintroduce the short haired bumblebee bombus subterraneus which had become extinct in britain from the british derived populations surviving in new zealand from their introduction there a century earlier 130 from 2011 the trust in partnership with natural england hymettus and the rspb has reintroduced short haired bumblebee queens from skåne in southern sweden to restored flower rich meadows at dungeness in kent the queens were checked for mites and american foulbrood disease agri environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of romney marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower rich habitat for the bees by the summer of 2013 workers of the species were found near the release zone proving that nests had been established the restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five schedule 41 priority species the ruderal bumblebee bombus ruderatus the red shanked carder bee bombus ruderarius the shrill carder bee bombus sylvarum the brown banded carder bee bombus humilis and the moss carder bee bombus muscorum 131 the world s first bumblebee sanctuary was established at vane farm in the loch leven national nature reserve in scotland in 2008 121 in 2011 london s natural history museum led the establishment of an international union for conservation of nature bumblebee specialist group chaired by dr paul h williams 132 to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using red list criteria 133 bumblebee conservation is in its infancy in many parts of the world but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops efforts are being made to manage farmland better enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips and in new zealand bee nesting boxes have achieved some success perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country 106 misconception about flight a widely believed falsehood holds that scientists proved bumblebees to be incapable of flight 134 further information insect flight according to 20th century folklore the laws of aerodynamics prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight as it does not have the capacity in terms of wing size or beats per second to achieve flight with the degree of wing loading necessary 135 supposedly someone did a back of the envelope calculation taking the weight of a bumblebee and its wing area into account and worked out that if it only flies at a couple of metres per second the wings wouldn t produce enough lift to hold the bee up explains charlie ellington professor of animal mechanics at cambridge university 135 the origin of this claim has been difficult to pin down with any certainty john h mcmasters recounted an anecdote about an unnamed swiss aerodynamicist at a dinner party who performed some rough calculations and concluded presumably in jest that according to the equations bumblebees cannot fly 136 in later years mcmasters backed away from this origin suggesting there could be multiple sources and the earliest he has found was a reference in the 1934 book le vol des insectes by french entomologist antoine magnan 1881 1938 they had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found their flight was impossible but one shouldn t be surprised that the results of the calculations don t square with reality 137 the following passage appears in the introduction to le vol des insectes 138 tout d abord poussé par ce qui se fait en aviation j ai appliqué aux insectes les lois de la résistance de l air et je suis arrivé avec m sainte laguë à cette conclusion que leur vol est impossible first prompted by what is done in aviation i applied the laws of air resistance to insects and i arrived with mr sainte laguë at this conclusion that their flight is impossible magnan refers to his assistant andré sainte laguë 139 some credit physicist ludwig prandtl 1875 1953 of the university of göttingen in germany with popularizing the idea others say swiss gas dynamicist jakob ackeret 1898 1981 did the calculations 140 bumblebee in flight it has its tongue extended and a laden pollen basket the calculations that purported to show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils the method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation this ignores the effect of dynamic stall an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight more sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle 141 additionally john maynard smith a noted biologist with a strong background in aeronautics has pointed out that bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area however in aerodynamics experiments with other insects he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude 142 in music and literature flight of the bumblebee flight of the bumblebee performed by the us army band problems playing this file see media help the russian composer nikolai rimsky korsakov wrote the flight of the bumblebee c 1900 the orchestral interlude flight of the bumblebee was composed c 1900 by nikolai rimsky korsakov it represents the turning of prince guidon into a bumblebee so he can fly away to visit his father tsar saltan in the opera the tale of tsar saltan 143 although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee 144 the music inspired walt disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical fantasia and have it sound as if it were flying in all parts of the theater 145 this early attempt at surround sound was excluded from the film in later showings in 1599 during the reign of queen elizabeth i someone possibly tailboys dymoke published caltha poetarum or the bumble bee under the pseudonym t cutwode 146 this was one of nine books censored under the bishop s ban issued by the archbishop of canterbury john whitgift and the bishop of london richard bancroft 147 emily dickinson wrote the bumble bee s religion 1881 emily dickinson made a bumblebee the subject of her parody of isaac watts s well known poem about honeybees how doth the little busy bee 1715 where watts wrote how skilfully she builds her cell how neat she spreads the wax 148 dickinson s poem the bumble bee s religion 1881 begins his little hearse like figure unto

149 150 in 1847 ralph waldo emerson published his poem the humble bee the entomologist otto plath wrote bumblebees and their ways in 1934 151 his daughter the poet sylvia plath wrote a group of poems about bees late in 1962 within four months of her suicide 152 transforming her father s interest into her poetry 153 bumblebees of different species illustrated by moses harris in his 1782 exposition of english insects the scientist and illustrator moses harris 1731 1785 painted accurate watercolour drawings of bumblebees in his an exposition of english insects including the several classes of neuroptera hymenoptera diptera or bees flies libellulae 1776 80 154 bumblebees appear as characters often eponymously in children s books the surname dumbledore in the harry potter series 1997 2007 is an old name for bumblebee 7 j k rowling said the name seemed to suit the headmaster because one of his passions is music and i imagined him walking around humming to himself 155 j r r tolkien in his

oncoming attacks against her and to counter them accordingly she currently wields twin energy katanas that can cut through anything except flesh and briefly merge into an energy shield she also carries with her a small stash of adrenaline both because clock king had briefly managed to make her addicted to the substance and also because while high on adrenaline her precognitive sense evolves

designationsheavenly bodymoon neptune jewelpearl in heraldry argent ˈɑːrdʒənt is the tincture of silver and belongs to the class of light tinctures called metals it is very frequently depicted as white and usually considered interchangeable with it in engravings and line drawings regions to be tinctured argent are either left blank or indicated with the abbreviation ar the name derives from latin argentum translated as silver or white metal the word argent had the same meaning in old french blazon whence it passed into the english language in some historical depictions of coats of arms a kind of silver leaf was applied to those parts of the device that were argent over time the silver content of these depictions has tarnished and darkened as a result it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish regions that were intended as argent from those that were sable this leaves a false impression that the rule of tincture has been violated in cases where when applied next to a dark colour argent now appears to be sable due to tarnish contents 1 argent versus white 2 meaning 3 gallery 4 references argent versus white edit arthur charles fox davies argued extensively in his book the art of heraldry an encyclopaedia of armory that though extremely rare the colour white existed as an independent tincture in heraldry separate from argent he bases this in part on the white labels used to differentiate the arms of members of the british royal family however it has been argued that these could be regarded as white labels proper thus rendering white not a heraldic tincture 1 white does seem to be regarded as a different tincture from argent in portuguese heraldry as evidenced by the arms of municipal de santiago do cacém in portugal in which the white of the fallen moor s clothing and the knight s horse is distinguished from the argent of the distant castle and in the arms of the logistical and administrative command of the portuguese air force meaning edit sometimes the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues and represent certain elements and precious stones even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries 2 it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are since the information is so often sought after many sources give different meanings but argent is often said to

negative man first appeared in my greatest adventure 80 and was created by bob haney arnold drake and bruno premiani 2 drake recalled i left editor murray boltinoff s office and bumped into bob haney in the hall bob was a real good friend of mine i asked him if he got an assignment from bob kanigher he had this routine where he d come up from woodstock once a week and stay for two nights and get a couple of assignments from kanigher and then go back home and write them he said he didn t get an assignment from kanigher and i told him i had this assignment that i was about two thirds through with but i needed another character and maybe between us we could come up with something we sat down and came up with this notion of a guy who has gone through a cloud of radioactivity and is bandaged from head to toe with these specially treated bandages that keep the radioactivity within him so he isn t injurious to others the most novel aspect was negative man the character who lives inside him who can only be outside of him for 60 seconds and don t ask me why 60 seconds 3 fictional character biography edit larry trainor edit the original negative man larry trainor is a founding member of the doom patrol along with elasti girl robotman and chief 4 like the rest of the doom patrol trainor sees himself as a victim as much as a hero and his superpower as an affliction rather than a blessing trainor s career as a superhero begins when he is accidentally exposed to a radioactive field in the atmosphere while piloting a test plane this experience leaves him radioactive but also gives him a strange superpower the ability to release a negatively charged energy being from his body the being also referred to as negative man or later as the negative spirit 5 can fly at high speed cause solid objects to explode and pass through solid materials it resembles a shadowy silhouette of a human being surrounded by a bright glow the being is under trainor s control and appears at first to have no mind of its own but trainor is weak and defenseless while the being is separated from his body he can only send it forth for 60 seconds at a time without risking death after his accident trainor resembles the invisible man he is forced to wear specially treated bandages over his entire body to protect bystanders from his radioactivity sales of doom patrol had waned and the creative team chose to kill off the entire team including negative man in the final issue doom patrol vol 2 121 september october 1968 the doom patrol sacrificed their lives to madame rouge and general zahl who pushed the actual kill button to save the small fishing village of codsville maine later it was revealed that larry trainor somehow never explained survived the explosion he turned up alive permanently separated from the radio energy being but still radioactive bandaged and weak in its absence larry trainor and valentina vostok edit in showcase 94 september 1977 the negative spirit reappears when it possesses a russian cosmonaut colonel valentina vostok who becomes negative woman initially vostok could transform herself into a radio energy form possessing the same capabilities as trainor s partner later as with trainor it would emerge from her leaving her physically weak but in control of it and requiring her to wear special bandages just as trainor had after trainor s return he gains strength from being in vostok s presence and pleads with her to return the negative being to him he later breaks reactron out of belle reve penitentiary and after fitting him with a regulator uses him to successfully draw the negative being out of vostok 6 during an encounter with garguax the negative being is disrupted and returns to vostok but saves trainor and in the process heals trainor completely removing all radioactivity from his body 7 after this trainor works with the patrol in a support capacity but occasionally enters combat using high tech weaponry trainor has since been reunited with the energy being and is an active member of the current incarnation of the doom patrol recently larry has exhibited the ability to cover himself in the negative energy that s inside him instead of releasing it thus gaining the same powers that the negative spirit has shown larry s inner monologue says that it s making him feel a burning sensation doom patrol vol 5 9 rebis edit the negative spirit later reveals itself to be amoral intelligent and capable of speech trainor pleads with it to leave him alone but it forcefully merges itself with both trainor and his physician dr eleanor poole together the three entities form rebis a divine intersex person who again must wear special bandages rebis has all of the memories of all three beings and is as such a compound being frequently using we when speaking of itself rebis has a larger range of powers than those of either trainor or vostok rebis can fly is psychic is extraordinarily intelligent and most significantly is immortal rebis unique life cycle is based on an event called the aenigma regis in which it throws off its old body and gives birth to a new version of itself in describing its paradoxical existence rebis often likens itself to russian dolls and to an ouroboros 8 rebis temporarily leaves the doom patrol to mate with itself and complete the aenigma regis part of this process involves working through the significant trauma and inner turmoil caused by the death of trainor and poole s separate identities at some point during this absence rebis also has intercourse with coagula giving her superpowers rebis s old body is killed by the candlemaker but rebis new presumably harmonized body soon returns to see the candlemaker defeated byrne incarnation edit in 2004 the doom patrol was rebooted in a jla storyline and new doom patrol series both written and illustrated by john byrne in this version of the doom patrol which ignored previous continuity trainor is once again negative man although his negative energy form now has the appearance of a black skeleton instead of a shadowy humanoid shape after this series was canceled the miniseries infinite crisis explained that this alteration had been caused by superboy prime s attempts to escape from the extradimensional heaven he shared with alexander luthor and the superman and lois lane of earth two when the doom patrol joins other heroes in fighting superboy prime negative man and the other doom patrol members including former member beast boy begin recalling their previous lives all previous incarnations of the doom patrol are now in continuity although the exact details of what this means are not yet clear keith giffen edit larry trainor is once again a member of doom patrol the negative energy being can now exist apart from trainor s body for much longer than 60 seconds during the blackest night he fights against black lantern valentina vostok pitting his negative spirit against the corrupt black lantern version and starts convulsing in pain after absorbing both entities 9 managing to take control of them he sends them into valentina overloading her and destroying her ring however when he recovers he cannot repeat the same attack against black lantern cliff steele before black lanterns celsius and tempest attack robotman comments that the combined form of both entities is partially similar to rebis 10 it is revealed that larry s original body was destroyed in the codsville explosion and that the negative is in fact larry mind consciousness and soul when he found himself without a physical body larry took solace in valentina vostok but only temporarily until the chief cloned him a new body when one of the bodies expires larry takes residence in a genetically altered brain dead donor body in the transaction larry obtains the memories and experiences of every host and the experience can be maddening to him so larry constantly reminds himself that he is larry trainor the new 52 edit while part of caulder s second wave of the doom patrol negative man and the team went on a mission to capture the ring of volthoom which had attached itself onto a woman named jessica cruz their mission put them in opposition to the justice league but was revealed by lex luthor that niles caused larry and every one else on the team s respective accidents forcing them to lose morale and give up young animal edit some time later larry was mysteriously beamed to what was known as the negative space and separated from his negative spirit keeg bovo after being sent back to earth larry was reunited with his fellow former doom and contacted by keeg bovo who invited larry to return to the negative space for trial trainor bovo and robotman went to the negative space and despite trainor being sentenced to continue being connected to bovo robotman talked the council out of their decision stating it was only fair for larry to decide if he wanted to continue the connection or be normal larry chose to continue being negative man and accepted bovo knowing that in this way he could continue helping people as a parting gift the council modifies his abilities so that whenever the negative spirit is released and larry is unconscious he experiences an entire normal human lifecycle as a way to allow him to have the chance to feel normal 11 many different negative spirits are seen

was bullied a lot while on the beach tired of being scrawny he was approached by a man who had a tv for a head and smoked three cigarinos at a time 4 he gave flex a coupon to fill out to get a body building book muscle mystery for you the instructions in the book turned flex into the muscled strongman he is now and he learned that when he flexed one type of muscle he could alter reality as he did his hero halo appeared over him which read hero of the beach after this he decided to become a crimefighter and dressed in wrestling boots and leopard skin trunks flex teamed up with a group of

every muscle in his body trying to turn the pentagon into a circle dolores left him in this time because he wouldn t stop flexing he failed and investigated the pentagon up close he was captured however by the real men from n o w h e r e and placed inside the tearoom of despair once there he lost his powers and his memory and was left to wander homeless and crazy until he found danny the

of 1 5 9 trioxo 13 azatriangulene and its chemical structure 3 a molecule is a group of two or more atoms held together by attractive forces known as chemical bonds depending on context the term may or may not include ions which satisfy this criterion 4 5 6 7 8 in quantum physics organic chemistry and biochemistry the distinction from ions is dropped and molecule is often used when referring to polyatomic ions a molecule may be homonuclear that is it consists of atoms of one chemical element e g two atoms in the oxygen molecule o2 or it may be heteronuclear a chemical compound composed of more than one element e g water two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom h2o in the kinetic theory of gases the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition this relaxes the requirement that a molecule contains two or more atoms since the noble gases are individual atoms 9 atoms and complexes connected by non covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds are typically not considered single molecules 10 concepts similar to molecules have been discussed since ancient times but modern investigation into the nature of molecules and their bonds began in the 17th century refined over time by scientists such as robert boyle amedeo avogadro jean perrin and linus pauling the study of molecules is today known as molecular physics or molecular

molecule derives from the latin moles or small unit of mass the word is derived from french molécule 1678 from new latin molecula diminutive of latin moles mass barrier the word which until the late 18th century was used only in latin form became popular after being used in works of philosophy by descartes 11 12 history main article history of molecular theory the definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased earlier definitions were less precise defining molecules as the smallest particles of pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical properties 13 this definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience such as rocks salts and metals are composed of large crystalline networks of chemically bonded atoms or ions but are not made of discrete molecules the modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre scientific and greek philosophers such as leucippus and democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids circa 450 bc empedocles imagined fundamental elements fire earth air and water and forces of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact a fifth element the incorruptible quintessence aether was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies the viewpoint of leucippus and empedocles along with the aether was accepted by aristotle and passed to medieval and renaissance europe in a more concrete manner however the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms i e molecules traces its origins to robert boyle s 1661 hypothesis in his famous treatise the sceptical chymist that matter is composed of clusters of particles and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters boyle argued that matter s basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles called corpuscles which were capable of arranging themselves into groups in 1789 william higgins published views on what he called combinations of ultimate particles which foreshadowed the concept of valency bonds if for example according to higgins the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6 then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles amedeo avogadro created the word molecule 14 his 1811 paper essay on determining the relative masses of the elementary molecules of bodies he essentially states i e according to partington s a short history of chemistry that 15 the smallest particles of gases are not necessarily simple atoms but are made up of a certain number of these atoms united by attraction to form a single molecule in coordination with these concepts in 1833 the french chemist marc antoine auguste gaudin presented a clear account of avogadro s hypothesis 16 regarding atomic weights by making use of volume diagrams which clearly show both semi correct molecular geometries such as a linear water molecule and correct molecular formulas such as h2o marc antoine auguste gaudin s volume diagrams of molecules in the gas phase 1833 in 1917 an unknown american undergraduate chemical engineer named linus pauling was learning the dalton hook and eye bonding method at the oregon agricultural college which was the mainstream description of bonds between atoms at the time pauling however wasn t satisfied with this method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method in 1926 french physicist jean perrin received the nobel prize in physics for proving conclusively the existence of molecules he did this by calculating avogadro s number using three different methods all involving liquid phase systems first he used a gamboge soap like emulsion second by doing experimental work on brownian motion and third by confirming einstein s theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase 17 in 1927 the physicists fritz london and walter heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion i e exchange forces of the hydrogen molecule their valence bond treatment of this problem in their joint paper 18 was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics their work was an influence on pauling who had just received his doctorate and visited heitler and london in zürich on a guggenheim fellowship subsequently in 1931 building on the work of heitler and london and on theories found in lewis famous article pauling published his ground breaking article the nature of the chemical bond 19 in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds on these concepts pauling developed hybridization theory to account for bonds in molecules such as ch4 in which four sp³ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen s 1s orbital yielding four sigma σ bonds the four bonds are of the same length and strength which yields a molecular structure as shown below a schematic presentation of hybrid orbitals overlapping hydrogens s orbitals molecular science the science of molecules is called molecular chemistry or molecular physics depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties in practice however this distinction is vague in molecular sciences a molecule consists of a stable system bound state composed of two or more atoms polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules the term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species i e short lived assemblies resonances of electrons and nuclei such as radicals molecular ions rydberg molecules transition states van der waals complexes or systems of colliding atoms as in bose einstein condensate prevalence this section does not cite any sources please help

matter are common they also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere most organic substances are molecules the substances of life are molecules e g proteins the amino acids of which they are composed the nucleic acids dna and rna sugars carbohydrates fats and vitamins the nutrient minerals are generally ionic compounds thus they are not molecules e g iron sulfate however the majority of familiar solid substances on earth are made partly or completely of crystals or ionic compounds which are not made of molecules these include all of the minerals that make up the substance of the earth sand clay pebbles rocks boulders bedrock the molten interior and the core of the earth all of these contain many chemical bonds but are not made of identifiable molecules no typical molecule can be defined for salts nor for covalent crystals although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane e g graphene or three dimensionally e g diamond quartz sodium chloride the theme of repeated unit cellular structure also holds for most metals which are condensed phases with metallic bonding thus solid metals are not made of molecules in glasses which are solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state the atoms are held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule nor any of the regularity of repeating unit cellular structure that characterizes salts covalent crystals and metals bonding molecules are generally held together by covalent bonding several non metallic elements exist only as molecules in the environment either in compounds or as homonuclear molecules not as free atoms for example hydrogen while some people say a metallic crystal can be considered a single giant molecule held together by metallic bonding 20 others point out that metals behave very differently than molecules 21 covalent a covalent bond forming h2 right where two hydrogen atoms share the two electrons main article covalent bonding a covalent bond is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms these electron pairs are termed shared pairs or bonding pairs and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons is termed covalent bonding 22 ionic main article ionic bonding sodium and fluorine undergoing a redox reaction to form sodium fluoride sodium loses its outer electron to give it a stable electron configuration and this electron enters the fluorine atom exothermically ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds the ions are atoms that have lost one or more electrons termed cations and atoms that have gained one or more electrons termed anions 23 this transfer of electrons is termed electrovalence in contrast to covalence in the simplest case the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom but these ions can be of a more complicated nature e g molecular ions like nh4 or so42 at normal temperatures and pressures ionic bonding mostly creates solids or occasionally liquids without separate identifiable molecules but the vaporization sublimation of such materials does produce separate molecules where electrons are still transferred fully enough for the bonds to be considered ionic rather than covalent molecular size most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye although molecules of many polymers can reach macroscopic sizes including biopolymers such as dna molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms å to several dozen å or around one billionth of a meter single molecules cannot usually be observed by light as noted above but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules the smallest molecule is the diatomic hydrogen h2 with a bond length of 0 74 å 24 effective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution 25 26 the table of permselectivity for different substances contains examples molecular formulas chemical formula types main article chemical formula the chemical formula for a molecule uses one line of chemical element symbols numbers and sometimes also other symbols such as parentheses dashes brackets and plus and minus signs these are limited to one typographic line of symbols which may include subscripts and superscripts a compound s empirical formula is a very simple type of chemical formula 27 it is the simplest integer ratio of the chemical elements that constitute it 28 for example water is always composed of a 2 1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms and ethanol ethyl alcohol is always composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in a 2 6 1 ratio however this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely dimethyl ether has the same ratios as ethanol for instance molecules with the same atoms in different arrangements are called isomers also carbohydrates for example have the same ratio carbon hydrogen oxygen 1 2 1 and thus the same empirical formula but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule the molecular formula reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules however different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules the empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always for example the molecule acetylene has molecular formula c2h2 but the simplest integer ratio of elements is ch the molecular mass can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional atomic mass units equal to 1 12 of the mass of a neutral carbon 12 12c isotope atom for network solids the term formula unit is used in stoichiometric calculations structural formula 3d left and center and 2d right representations of the terpenoid molecule atisane main article structural formula for molecules with a complicated 3 dimensional structure especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents a simple molecular formula or even semi structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule in this case a graphical type of formula called a structural formula may be needed structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one dimensional chemical name but such chemical nomenclature requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas molecular geometry main article molecular geometry structure and stm image of a cyanostar dendrimer molecule 29 molecules have fixed equilibrium geometries bond lengths and angles about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions a pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure the chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties particularly its reactivity isomers share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures stereoisomers a particular type of isomer may have very similar physico chemical properties and at the same time different biochemical activities molecular spectroscopy main article spectroscopy hydrogen can be removed from individual h2tpp molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope stm a this removal alters the current voltage i v curves of tpp molecules measured using the same stm tip from diode like red curve in b to resistor like green curve image c shows a row of tpp h2tpp and tpp molecules while scanning image d excess voltage was applied to h2tpp at the black dot which instantly removed hydrogen as shown in the bottom part of d and in the rescan image e such manipulations can be used in single molecule electronics 30 molecular spectroscopy deals with the response spectrum of molecules interacting with probing signals of known energy or frequency according to planck s formula molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule s energy exchange through absorbance or emission 31 spectroscopy does not generally refer to diffraction studies where particles such as neutrons electrons or high energy x rays interact with a regular arrangement of molecules as in a crystal microwave spectroscopy commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules and can be used to identify molecules in outer space infrared spectroscopy measures the vibration of molecules including stretching bending or twisting motions it is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or functional groups in molecules changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet visible or near infrared light and result in colour nuclear resonance spectroscopy measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule theoretical aspects the study of molecules by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is largely based on quantum mechanics and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond the simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule ion h2 and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one electron bond h2 is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron which means that the schrödinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron electron repulsion with the development of fast digital computers approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry when trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule iupac suggests that it must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state 4 this definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms but only on the strength of the interaction in fact it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules such as the helium dimer he2 which has one vibrational bound state 32 and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures whether or not an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition philosophically therefore a molecule is not a fundamental entity in contrast for instance to an elementary particle rather the concept of a molecule is the chemist s way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic scale interactions in the world that we observe see also atom chemical

with metamorpho this bred a bitter rivalry between the two one that persisted for many years java even risked his life once to save sapphire from a melting skyscraper and was transformed into a petrified fossil for his actions stagg s scientific prowess saved his life and returned him to normal 1 during a time when metamorpho was believed to be dead sapphire relented to java s persistent advances and married him java became the father figure to sapphire and rex s mutant son joey java was not an inherently evil individual but his moral base had been compromised due to his constant exposure to the unscrupulous simon stagg he was also extremely selfish when it came to his wants and desires when rex abducted joey from stagg mansion java flew into a rage and was determined to kill him even simon s command over him could not quell java s emotions frustrated by the neanderthal s rare act of defiance simon stagg shot him in the head seemingly killing him 2 java did not remain dead for long however the means behind his resurrection are unknown but he was seen once again several years later attending the funeral of metamorpho who at the time was believed to be dead 3 during the

broke damaging the carriage and causing it to derail until the train was stopped by green lantern stagg reprimanded java for this failure as it drew unwarranted attention to his operations true enough stagg hadn t finished when rex mason inquired about java s presence on the train this and the fact that mason was seeing stagg s daughter sapphire led him to test out the metamorpho project on mason the morning after java accompanied stagg to mason s hospital room after learning what had happened rex went mad but java could not stop him and was knocked out with a bed pan following mason s trail
