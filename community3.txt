planet myar and is an enemy of the legion of super heroes created by jim shooter nemesis kid first appeared in adventure comics 346 july 1966 1 contents 1 fictional character biography 2 powers and abilities 3 in other media 4 see also 5 references 6 external links fictional character biography edit in his first appearance hart druiter applied to the legion of super heroes to be a member along with princess projectra karate kid and ferro lad 2 he identified himself as a native of the planet myar the alchemy planet and claimed he had created a mystical potion that gave him his powers he was actually sent to infiltrate the legion of super heroes on behalf of the alien khunds when his deception was revealed he tried to frame karate kid as the traitor when that failed he fled 3 he later became a founding member of the legion of super villains under tarik the mute 4 when a later incarnation of the group invaded the planet orando under druiter s leadership nemesis kid engaged karate kid in single combat before the fight ended karate kid sacrificed himself to stop the legion of super villains plans dealing nemesis kid a final blow karate kid s widow queen projectra attacked nemesis kid using her power to generate illusions though he had adapted an immunity to her illusions projectra intimidated him with her noble fury over the death of her consort thus immobilizing him from counterattacking and or preventing him from concentrating to gain a new adaptation then she broke his neck executing him as her royal privilege as ruler of orando at least five years later nemesis kid was resurrected by mordru along with every other corpse in the 30th century as part of the sorcerer s scheme to take over the universe his reanimated corpse retained his powers but he was defeated and his body was incinerated presumably disposing of him for good in his original pre crisis appearances nemesis kid only suffered three defeats in single combat duo damsel defeated him since his power would not work on her two bodies 5 projectra intimidated him from using his power thus freeing her to execute him look into my eyes churl as a resurrected corpse he proved immune to projectra s illusions but she turned his strength against him and threw him into a fire incinerating his corpse nemesis kid did not appear in the reboot legion in the threeboot continuity he appeared in supergirl and the legion of superheroes 22 as a member of a group later identified as mekt ranzz s wanderers other than a talent for computer hacking possibly metahuman enhanced he displayed no super human abilities powers and abilities edit nemesis kid possessed the superhuman ability to spontaneously develop the powers appropriate to defeat any single opponent for the duration of the battle though against more than one opponent his powers would either work against only one target allow him to escape the situation via teleportation or fail to work at all in one recorded instance karate kid 1 he displayed the ability to choose adaptations but his choices were less than successful in all other cases his power somehow sensed what would be most effective against a given opponent and generated an adaptation automatically nemesis kid never manifested any but the most basic and direct power to counter an opponent thus against superboy or supergirl he would gain superior strength and resistance to damage rather than the ability to emit kryptonite radiation his power only provided abilities to beat a single opponent s skill set because of this he typically sought out the most powerful opponent whenever possible nemesis kid s powers were never shown to give him immunity to harm caused by an opponent which is why both superboy and karate kid could injure him and projectra was ultimately able to kill him his power simply seemed to assure that he would inevitably win a conflict against a single opponent it is not known what the upper limits of his powers were or if they could generate an adaptation powerful enough to match cosmic menaces such as the anti monitor the monarch imperiex or mordru while nemesis kid could adapt to defeat robots in the first issue brainiac 5 built a cell that could resist nemesis kid s adaptations he escaped it by adapting the power of time travel and traveling to a point in time when the cell wasn t built it was never shown if nemesis kid could adapt to defeat non sentient items such as automated weaponry firing upon him or adapt to an opponent in anything other than a physical contest despite his villainous nature he somehow passed the legion s customary and undepicted test of a candidate s good character which could indicate other forms of adaptation on at least one occasion nemesis kid displayed a profound fear response when he and his lsv partners were confronted by the heroic legion this allowed projectra to defeat him with a simple demonic illusion which reduced him to a fearful wreck nemesis kid was purportedly a skilled alchemist but he has never displayed any ability and or interest in creating other mystical potions so the claim may have been a cover story to disguise his power s true origin he has a passing knowledge of 30th century technology and a basic understanding of tactics and strategy in other media edit nemesis kid appeared in the legion of super heroes episode the karate kid voiced by keith ferguson unlike his original comic book incarnation this version was truly a hero and had the inherent ability to temporarily nullify anyone else s superpowers and was a member of a special unit of the science police the origin and extent of his abilities is not revealed he joined the legion and assisted in taking down grimbor the chainsman grimbor uses a weapon that he claims is inspired by nemesis kid s power and it appears to be identical in effect but whether there is some closer connection between the two is not revealed presumably there is an upper limit to his nullification ability as the legion have not used nemesis kid in subsequent anticipated encounters against imperiex see also edit one of us is a traitor references edit wells john 2014 american comic book chronicles 1965

and telepathic main article legion of super heroes 1958 team the first invisible kid was lyle norg an early member of the legion who gained his powers from a chemical serum he invented 6 he first appeared in action comics 267 his scientific aptitude meant he got along well with the super intelligent brainiac 5 his abilities made him a valuable asset to the legion espionage squad of which he was a permanent member norg also served one term as legion leader he was killed by the monster validus of the fatal five in superboy and the legion of super heroes 203 july august 1974 7 many years later during the five year gap following the magic wars earth fell under the covert control of the dominators and withdrew from the united planets a few years later the members of the dominators highly classified batch sw6 escaped captivity originally batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenage legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken just prior to ferro lad s death at the hands of the sun eater since lyle was legion leader at that time the members of batch sw6 were led by the teenage lyle later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts after earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 8 a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as new earth the sw6 legionnaires including their version of invisible kid remained reboot edit main article legion of super heroes 1994 team following the zero hour legion reboot lyle norg was still alive and serving with the legion as well as a brilliant chemist he was also a professional spy at a very young age he invented the invisibility serum while in earthgov intelligence s spy school rather than his scientific aptitude resulting in his getting on well with brainiac 5 they had more of a rivalry while querl was more intelligent lyle had more imagination being quicker to see unexpected applications for discoveries he was the de facto leader of the legion espionage squad consisting of himself chameleon apparition triad and shrinking violet and was instrumental in bringing down the corrupt administration of united planets president chu lyle served one term as legion leader during his tenure this version of the legion defeated mordru in their first and only battle with the sorcerer according to the definitive guide to the characters of the dc universe 2004 he was in a homosexual relationship with condo arlik this however was never stated explicitly in the comic book itself and was never developed threeboot continuity 2004 2009 edit main article legion of super heroes 2004 team lyle norg is a genius with a skill for xenochemistry who was used by his father to develop an invisibility serum his science police officer father used to bring him alien cell samples nearly every night to experiment with by the time he had successfully created a serum he discovered that his father promised to hand over lyle s research to the science police all along so he injected the only existing serum into himself and lied about it before contacting brainiac 5 for help brainy invited lyle to join the legion eventually his father discovered the truth and tried to get lyle to quit and hand over the serum after the legion was outlawed lyle reneged and produced a blood sample for his father to use the sample was encoded with a monitoring virus allowing legion access to the united planets systemworks because of his relationship to brainiac 5 his teammates have snarlingly nicknamed him brainiac 6 when lyle betrayed cosmic boy s trust by revealing to brainiac 5 that several members had broken into brainy s lab he lied to the team by blaming everything on shrinking violet he and violet who prefers the moniker atom girl have since made a deal to continue the ruse but his teammates still have a hard time trusting him when supergirl mysteriously appeared in the 31st century lyle along with half the male legionnaires vied for her attention however lyle convinced cosmic boy that he did not have a crush on supergirl in order to remove the competition for her affections he recently had his arm torn off when his flight ring exploded and was given an alien arm to replace it by a member of the wanderers he is left in metropolis the doctors reproducing his dna to give him another arm his arm apparently healed he returns to the active roster to save a young tritonian mutant gazelle for whom he carries a torch from then on 9 during an invasion of aliens hailing from cyberspace a small squad of legionnaires including him and the recently appointed gazelle are digitized and sent into their home base invisible lad has a customized avatar issued by brainac 5 with a bulkier and more handsome physique that greatly impresses gazelle who despite being saved by him had never seen his face due to his invisibility powers his idealized body is shown to be a trojan horse able to give brainiac 5 complete mastery over the alien digital universe invisible kid gazelle and the other legionnaires spend some time trapped in cyberspace while brainiac 5 restores their physical bodies damaged in a skirmish between the coluan and some physical avatars of the invading aliens in that week invisible kid admits his feelings for gazelle who happily reciprocates upon returning to the physical world they both witness brainiac 5 and nura nal exchanging their nuptial vows and inviting them to their marriage 10 post infinite crisis 2007 edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics lyle is depicted as a member of this version of the team in justice society of america vol 3 5 june 2007 and action comics 858 late december 2007 but this incarnation of the legion shares roughly the same history as the original legion up to the events of crisis on infinite earths 11 therefore this version of lyle is presumably deceased jacques foccart edit comics character invisible kidpublication informationpublisherdc comicsfirst appearancelegion of super heroes vol 2 annual 1 1982 created bypaul levitzkeith giffen based upon the lyle norg character by jerry siegel and jim mooney in story informationalter egojacques foccartspeciesmetahumanplace of originearth 31st century team affiliationslegion of super heroesabilitiesability to stay undetected from many kinds of means ocular auditory and telepathic formerly teleportation many years later brainiac 5 was approached by jacques foccart a teenage native of earth from what was once the francophone african nation of côte d ivoire jacques younger sister danielle was suffering from a life threatening neurological disorder which had baffled the best medical experts of the 30th century and jacques took her to brainiac 5 as a last resort brainiac 5 rashly decided to utilize a piece of circuitry from the dismantled machine computo a highly advanced supercomputer he had created years earlier computo promptly possessed danielle s body computo took control of legion headquarters and the city of metropolis and nearly killed several legionnaires in order to save danielle and the others jacques drank lyle norg s serum and gained the power of invisibility immediately thereafter the legion voted jacques onto the team as its newest member he took the name invisible kid in honor of lyle 12 within days of jacques addition to the team the legion faced a new foe whom they initially referred to as the master of the servants of darkness the servants master possessed a myriad of superpowers including the ability to generate teleportation tubes out of thin air and after one encounter jacques decided to follow him the sight of the real face of the servants master later revealed as the ancient villain darkseid frightened jacques so deeply that a large strip of his jet black hair turned permanently white 13 jacques soon learned that unlike his predecessor he had also developed the ability to teleport and shift into other dimensions this talent served him well when he and his teammate wildfire were almost killed by a lyle norg imposter however when he caused the death of a criminal by accidentally teleporting him into space jacques had the additional powers removed jacques served as a permanent member of the legion espionage squad along with chameleon boy phantom girl and shrinking violet five years later edit during the five year gap following the magic wars the legion disbanded and earth s government fell under the covert control of the dominators who had attempted to conquer the planet in the 20th century earth withdrew from the united planets and the government gradually became more repressive jacques became the leader of a resistance cell which included himself tyroc and the former members of the legion of substitute heroes he became romantically involved with drura sepht a substitute hero who once called herself infectious lass he successfully led the resistance to victory over the dominators along with the unlikely assistance of former legion foe universo and the members of the dominators highly classified batch sw6 at the time batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenaged legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken immediately following the team s first encounter with universo 14 later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts in any event the emergence of the sw6 legionnaires allowed jacques to meet their leader the real lyle norg for the first time after the defeat of the dominators jacques became a planetary hero the people of earth rewarded his efforts by making him president of the planet with troy stewart tyroc serving as vice president but soon thereafter earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 15 a few dozen cities and their inhabitants survived and the planet was reconstituted as new earth eventually jacques resigned as president to rejoin the legion where he served as co leader with rokk krinn and troy ascended to the presidency post zero hour edit after legion continuity was completed rebooted by the events of zero hour jacques was recast as a close friend of lyle norg from their days in school jacques was forced by charma a fellow student who had developed mind control abilities to drink lyle s serum as a test to see if it would be safe for her jacques was believed to have been killed by the serum as lyle had calibrated it to only work with his physiology in truth he was saved by the intelligence division the serum worked differently for him than for lyle granting him the ability to become undetectable by any means though this ability causes him severe pain to use he continued to work for earthgov s intelligence some time after lyle joined the legion jacques would later save lyle from charma though he could not reveal that he still lived 16 post infinite crisis edit jacques has not appeared in the threeboot legion continuity which began in 2005 however the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have restored a close analogue of the pre crisis on infinite earths legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics jacques is included in their number the events of the five years later era including jacques rise to the presidency of earth are no longer part of mainstream dc continuity reception edit syfy ranked the first invisible kid as the 24th greatest legion of superheroes member stating that during his time in the 1960s invisible kid was a constant but not noteworthy presence until he was killed by validus when the legion rebooted in 1994 he became a major player showing he was one of the saaviest members of the team syfy ranked the second invisible kid as number 38 describing the character as boring and notable because of his name and his rogue inspired haircut syfy opined that despite later becoming president of earth he never did a whole lot except shout french expressions 17 in other media edit the jacques foccart version of the invisible kid has made background appearances in the

unpredictable fire in an area of combustible vegetation starting in rural and urban areas 1 2 some forest ecosystems in their natural state depend on wildfire 3 depending on the type of vegetation present a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a bushfire in australia desert fire grass fire hill fire peat fire prairie fire vegetation fire or veld fire 4 wildfires are distinct from beneficial uses of fire called controlled burns though controlled burns can turn into wildfires fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants approximately 419 million years ago during the silurian period 5 the occurrence of wildfires throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems flora and fauna 6 earth s carbon rich vegetation seasonally dry climates atmospheric oxygen and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions create good conditions for fires 6 wildfires are often classified by characteristics like cause of ignition physical properties combustible material present and the effect of weather on the fire 7 wildfire behavior and severity result from a combination of factors such as available fuels physical setting and weather 8 9 10 11 climatic cycles that include wet periods that create substantial fuels and then are followed by drought and heat often proceed severe wildfires 12 these cycles are made worse by heat waves and droughts caused by climate change 13 wildfires can cause damage to property and human life although naturally occurring wildfires 14 may have beneficial effects on native vegetation animals and ecosystems that have evolved with fire 15 16 high severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat also called snag forest habitat which often has higher species richness and diversity than an unburned old forest many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction 17 wildfires in ecosystems where wildfire is uncommon or where non native vegetation has encroached may have strongly negative ecological effects 7 similarly human societies can be severely impacted by fires including direct health impacts of smoke destruction of property especially in wildland urban interfaces economic and ecosystem services losses and contamination of water and soil 13 wildfires are among the most common forms of natural disaster in some regions including siberia california and australia 18 19 20 areas with mediterranean climates or in the taiga biome are particularly susceptible at a global level human practices have made wildfires worse than naturally would happen with a doubling in land area burned by wildfires when compared to natural levels 13 humans have contributed to major factors to increased wildfires increased heat and dry periods due to climate change and other more direct human activities such as land use change and wildfire suppression 13 the increase in severity of fires 21 creates a positive feedback loop by releasing naturally sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere increasing the atmosphere s greenhouse effect

human causes of wildfires are equipment generating sparks chainsaws grinders mowers etc overhead power lines and arson 24 25 26 27 28 29 in the tropics farmers often practice the slash and burn method of clearing fields during the dry season when thousands of farmers do this simultaneously much of a continent can appear from orbit to be one vast blaze 30 31 coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world such as those in burning mountain new south wales centralia pennsylvania and several coal sustained fires in china they can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material 32 spread edit a surface fire in the western desert of utah united states charred landscape following a crown fire in the north cascades united states forest fires visible from a distance in dajti national park tirana albania the spread of wildfires varies based on the flammable material present its vertical arrangement and moisture content and weather conditions 33 fuel arrangement and density is governed in part by topography as land shape determines factors such as available sunlight and water for plant growth overall fire types can be generally characterized by their fuels as follows ground fires are fed by subterranean roots duff and other buried organic matter this fuel type is especially susceptible to ignition due to spotting see below ground fires typically burn by smoldering and can burn slowly for days to months such as peat fires in kalimantan and eastern sumatra indonesia which resulted from a riceland creation project that unintentionally drained and dried the peat 34 35 36 crawling or surface fires are fueled by low lying vegetation on the forest floor such as leaf and timber litter debris grass and low lying shrubbery 37 this kind of fire often burns at a relatively lower temperature than crown fires less than 400 c 752 f and may spread at slow rate though steep slopes and wind can accelerate the rate of spread 38 ladder fires consume material between low level vegetation and tree canopies such as small trees downed logs and vines kudzu old world climbing fern and other invasive plants that scale trees may also encourage ladder fires 39 crown canopy or aerial fires burn suspended material at the canopy level such as tall trees vines and mosses the ignition of a crown fire termed crowning is dependent on the density of the suspended material canopy height canopy continuity sufficient surface and ladder fires vegetation moisture content and weather conditions during the blaze 40 stand replacing fires lit by humans can spread into the amazon rain forest damaging ecosystems not particularly suited for heat or arid conditions 41 in monsoonal areas of north australia surface fires can spread including across intended firebreaks by burning or smoldering pieces of wood or burning tufts of grass carried intentionally by large flying birds accustomed to catch prey flushed out by wildfires species involved in this activity are the black kite milvus migrans whistling kite haliastur sphenurus and brown falcon falco berigora local aborigines have known of this behavior for a long time including in their mythology 42 physical properties edit experimental fire in canada see also combustion fire control heat wave and firestorm a dirt road acted as a fire barrier in south africa the effects of the barrier can clearly be seen on the unburnt left and burnt right sides of the road wildfires occur when all the necessary elements of a fire triforce come together in a susceptible area an ignition source is brought into contact with a combustible material such as vegetation that is subjected to enough heat and has an adequate supply of oxygen from the ambient air a high moisture content usually prevents ignition and slows propagation because higher temperatures are needed to evaporate any water in the material and heat the material to its fire point 10 43 dense forests usually provide more shade resulting in lower ambient temperatures and greater humidity and are therefore less susceptible to wildfires 44 less dense material such as grasses and leaves are easier to ignite because they contain less water than denser material such as branches and trunks 45 plants continuously lose water by evapotranspiration but water loss is usually balanced by water absorbed from the soil humidity or rain 46 when this balance is not maintained plants dry out and are therefore more flammable often as a consequence of droughts 47 48 a wildfire front is the portion sustaining continuous flaming combustion where unburned material meets active flames or the smoldering transition between unburned and burned material 49 as the front approaches the fire heats both the surrounding air and woody material through convection and thermal radiation first wood is dried as water is vaporized at a temperature of 100 c 212 f next the pyrolysis of wood at 230 c 450 f releases flammable gases finally wood can smolder at 380 c 720 f or when heated sufficiently ignite at 590 c 1 000 f 50 51 even before the flames of a wildfire arrive at a particular location heat transfer from the wildfire front warms the air to 800 c 1 470 f which pre heats and dries flammable materials causing materials to ignite faster and allowing the fire to spread faster 45 52 high temperature and long duration surface wildfires may encourage flashover or torching the drying of tree canopies and their subsequent ignition from below 53 wildfires have a rapid forward rate of spread fros when burning through dense uninterrupted fuels 54 they can move as fast as 10 8 kilometres per hour 6 7 mph in forests and 22 kilometres per hour 14 mph in grasslands 55 wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front or burn in the opposite direction of the main front by backing 56 they may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands hot wood embers and other burning materials through the air over roads rivers and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks 57 58 torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting and dry ground fuels around a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands 59 spotting can create spot fires as hot embers and firebrands ignite fuels downwind from the fire in australian bushfires spot fires are known to occur as far as 20 kilometres 12 mi from the fire front 60 the incidence of large uncontained wildfires in north america has increased in recent years significantly impacting both urban and agriculturally focused areas the physical damage and health pressures left in the wake of uncontrolled fires has especially devastated farm and ranch operators in affected areas prompting concern from the community of healthcare providers and advocates servicing this specialized occupational population 61 especially large wildfires may affect air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect air rises as it is heated and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal columns 62 great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds strong winds and fire whirls with the force of tornadoes at speeds of more than 80 kilometres per hour 50 mph 63 64 65 rapid rates of spread prolific crowning or spotting the presence of fire whirls and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions 66 the thermal heat from a wildfire can cause significant weathering of rocks and boulders heat can rapidly expand a boulder and thermal shock can occur which may cause an object s structure to fail climate change effects edit see also effects of climate change average u s acreage burned annually by wildfires has almost tripled in three decades 67 lightning sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences during the dry summer season in nevada a wildfire in venezuela during a drought increasing risks due to heat waves and droughts edit heat waves droughts climate variability such as el niño and regional weather patterns such as high pressure ridges can increase the risk and alter the behavior of wildfires dramatically 68 69 70 years of precipitation followed by warm periods can encourage more widespread fires and longer fire seasons 71 temperature affects wildfires in the same way they dry out the load and make them more flammable 72 since the mid 1980s earlier snowmelt and associated warming has also been associated with an increase in length and severity of the wildfire season or the most fire prone time of the year 73 in the western united states 74 global warming may increase the intensity and frequency of droughts in many areas creating more intense and frequent wildfires 7 a 2019 study indicates that the increase in fire risk in california may be attributable to human induced climate change 75 a study of alluvial sediment deposits going back over 8 000 years found warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and stand replacing fires and concluded climate was such a powerful influence on wildfire that trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future 76 intensity also increases during daytime hours burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day due to lower humidity increased temperatures and increased wind speeds 77 sunlight warms the ground during the day which creates air currents that travel uphill at night the land cools creating air currents that travel downhill wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys 78 fires in europe occur frequently during the hours of 12 00 p m and 2 00 p m 79 wildfire suppression operations in the united states revolve around a 24 hour fire day that begins at 10 00 a m due to the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth 80 in the summer of 1974 1975 southern hemisphere australia suffered its worst recorded wildfire when 15 of australia s land mass suffered extensive fire damage 81 fires that summer burned up an estimated 117 million hectares 290 million acres 1 170 000 square kilometres 450 000 square miles 82 83 in australia the annual number of hot days above 35 c and very hot days above 40 c has increased significantly in many areas of the country since 1950 the country has always had bushfires but in 2019 the extent and ferocity of these fires increased dramatically 84 for the first time catastrophic bushfire conditions were declared for greater sydney new south wales and queensland declared a state of emergency but fires were also burning in south australia and western australia 85 in 2019 extreme heat and dryness caused massive wildfires in siberia alaska canary islands australia and in the amazon rainforest the fires in the latter were caused mainly by illegal logging the smoke from the fires expanded on huge territory including major cities dramatically reducing air quality 86 as of august 2020 the wildfires in that year were 13 worse than in 2019 due primarily to climate change and deforestation 87 the amazon rainforest s existence is threatened by fires 88 89 90 91 according to mike barrett executive director of science and conservation at wwf uk if this rainforest is destroyed we lose the fight against climate change there will be no going back 87 record breaking wildfires in 2021 occurred in turkey greece california and russia thought to be linked to climate change 92 due to their infrequent and complex nature it is extremely difficult to collect on wildfires to effectively combat them 93 carbon dioxide and other emissions from fires edit wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide black and brown carbon particles and ozone precursors such as volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides nox into the atmosphere 94 95 these emissions affect radiation clouds and climate on regional and even global scales wildfires also emit substantial amounts of semi volatile organic species that can partition from the gas phase to form secondary organic aerosol soa over hours to days after emission in addition the formation of the other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires 96 while direct emissions of harmful pollutants can affect first responders and local residents wildfire smoke can also be transported over long distances and impact air quality across local regional and global scales 97 whether transported smoke plumes are relevant for surface air quality depends on where they exist in the atmosphere which in turn depends on the initial injection height of the convective smoke plume into the atmosphere smoke that is injected above the planetary boundary layer pbl may be detectable from spaceborne satellites and play a role in altering the earth s energy budget but would not mix down to the surface where it would impact air quality and human health alternatively smoke confined to a shallow pbl through nighttime stable stratification of the atmosphere or terrain trapping may become particularly concentrated and problematic for surface air quality wildfire intensity and smoke emissions are not constant throughout the fire lifetime and tend to follow a diurnal cycle that peaks in late afternoon and early evening and which may be reasonably approximated using a monomodal or bimodal normal distribution 98 over the past century wildfires have accounted for 20 25 of global carbon emissions the remainder from human activities 99 global carbon emissions from wildfires through august 2020 equaled the average annual emissions of the european union 87 in 2020 the carbon released by california s wildfires were significantly larger than the state s other carbon emissions 100 ecology edit main article fire ecology see also disturbance ecology and forestry global fires during the year 2008 for the months of august top image and february bottom image as detected by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on nasa s terra satellite wildfire s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems flora and fauna 6 wildfires are common in climates that are sufficiently moist to allow the growth of vegetation but feature extended dry hot periods 17 such places include the vegetated areas of australia and southeast asia the veld in southern africa the fynbos in the western cape of south africa the forested areas of the united states and canada and the mediterranean basin high severity wildfire creates complex early seral forest habitat also called snag forest habitat which often has higher species richness and diversity than unburned old forest 15 plant and animal species in most types of north american forests evolved with fire and many of these species depend on wildfires and particularly high severity fires to reproduce and grow fire helps to return nutrients from plant matter back to soil the heat from fire is necessary to the germination of certain types of seeds and the snags dead trees and early successional forests created by high severity fire create habitat conditions that are beneficial to wildlife 15 early successional forests created by high severity fire support some of the highest levels of native biodiversity found in temperate conifer forests 16 101 post fire logging has no ecological benefits and many negative impacts the same is often true for post fire seeding 102 although some ecosystems rely on naturally occurring fires to regulate growth some ecosystems suffer from too much fire such as the chaparral in southern california and lower elevation deserts in the american southwest the increased fire frequency in these ordinarily fire dependent areas has upset natural cycles damaged native plant communities and encouraged the growth of non native weeds 103 104 105 106 invasive species such as lygodium microphyllum and bromus tectorum can grow rapidly in areas that were damaged by fires because they are highly flammable they can increase the future risk of fire creating a positive feedback loop that increases fire frequency and further alters native vegetation communities 39 107 in the amazon rainforest drought logging cattle ranching practices and slash and burn agriculture damage fire resistant forests and promote the growth of flammable brush creating a cycle that encourages more burning 108 fires in the rainforest threaten its collection of diverse species and produce large amounts of co2 109 also fires in the rainforest along with drought and human involvement could damage or destroy more than half of the amazon rainforest by 2030 110 wildfires generate ash reduce the availability of organic nutrients and cause an increase in water runoff eroding away other nutrients and creating flash flood conditions 33 111 a 2003 wildfire in the north yorkshire moors burned off 2 5 square kilometers 600 acres of heather and the underlying peat layers afterwards wind erosion stripped the ash and the exposed soil revealing archaeological remains dating back to 10 000 bc 112 wildfires can also have an effect on climate change increasing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere and inhibiting vegetation growth which affects overall carbon uptake by plants 113 in tundra there is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain research in alaska has shown fire event return intervals fris that typically vary from 150 to 200 years with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter upland areas 114 plant adaptation edit ecological succession after a wildfire in a boreal pine forest next to hara bog lahemaa national park estonia the pictures were taken one and two years after the fire main article fire adaptations plants in wildfire prone ecosystems often survive through adaptations to their local fire regime such adaptations include physical protection against heat increased growth after a fire event and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition for example plants of the genus eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves to resist heat and drought ensuring their dominance over less fire tolerant species 115 116 dense bark shedding lower branches and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures 17 fire resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation as embodied by pioneer species smoke charred wood and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds in a process called serotiny 117 exposure to smoke from burning plants promotes germination in other types of plants by inducing the production of the orange butenolide 118 grasslands in western sabah malaysian pine forests and indonesian casuarina forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire 119 chamise deadwood litter is low in water content and flammable and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire 17 cape lilies lie dormant until flames brush away the covering and then blossom almost overnight 120 sequoia rely on periodic fires to reduce competition release seeds from their cones and clear the soil and canopy for new growth 121 caribbean pine in bahamian pineyards have adapted to and rely on low intensity surface fires for survival and growth an optimum fire frequency for growth is every 3 to 10 years too frequent fires favor herbaceous plants and infrequent fires favor species typical of bahamian dry forests 122 atmospheric effects edit see also air pollution carbon cycle atmospheric chemistry haze 1997 southeast asian haze and 2005 malaysian haze a pyrocumulus cloud produced by a wildfire in yellowstone national park most of the earth s weather and air pollution resides in the troposphere the part of the atmosphere that extends from the surface of the planet to a height of about 10 kilometers 6 mi the vertical lift of a severe thunderstorm or pyrocumulonimbus can be enhanced in the area of a large wildfire which can propel smoke soot and other particulate matter as high as the lower stratosphere 123 previously prevailing scientific theory held that most particles in the stratosphere came from volcanoes but smoke and other wildfire emissions have been detected from the lower stratosphere 124 pyrocumulus clouds can reach 6 100 meters 20 000 ft over wildfires 125 satellite observation of smoke plumes from wildfires revealed that the plumes could be traced intact for distances exceeding 1 600 kilometers 1 000 mi 126 computer aided models such as calpuff may help predict the size and direction of wildfire generated smoke plumes by using atmospheric dispersion modeling 127 wildfires can affect local atmospheric pollution 128 and release carbon in the form of carbon dioxide 129 wildfire emissions contain fine particulate matter which can cause cardiovascular and respiratory problems 130 increased fire byproducts in the troposphere can increase ozone concentration beyond safe levels 131 forest fires in indonesia in 1997 were estimated to have released between 0 81 and 2 57 gigatonnes 0 89 and 2 83 billion short tons of co2 into the atmosphere which is between 13 40 of the annual global carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels 132 133 in june and july 2019 fires in the arctic emitted more than 140 megatons of carbon dioxide according to an analysis by cams to put that into perspective this amounts to the same amount of carbon emitted by 36 million cars in a year the recent wildfires and their massive co2 emissions mean that it will be important to take them into consideration when implementing measures for reaching greenhouse gas reduction targets accorded with the paris climate agreement 134 due to the complex oxidative chemistry occurring during the transport of wildfire smoke in the atmosphere 135 the toxicity of emissions was indicated to increase over time 136 137 atmospheric models suggest that these concentrations of sooty particles could increase absorption of incoming solar radiation during winter months by as much as 15 138 the amazon is estimated to hold around 90 billion tons of carbon as of 2019 earth s atmosphere has 415 parts per million of carbon and the destruction of the amazon would add about 38

and the hillside from the risk of fire wildfire prevention refers to the preemptive methods aimed at reducing the risk of fires as well as lessening its severity and spread 140 prevention techniques aim to manage air quality maintain ecological balances protect resources 107 and to affect future fires 141 north american firefighting policies permit naturally caused fires to burn to maintain their ecological role so long as the risks of escape into high value areas are mitigated 142 however prevention policies must consider the role that humans play in wildfires since for example 95 of forest fires in europe are related to human involvement 143 sources of human caused fire may include arson accidental ignition or the uncontrolled use of fire in land clearing and agriculture such as the slash and burn farming in southeast asia 144 in 1937 u s president franklin d roosevelt initiated a nationwide fire prevention campaign highlighting the role of human carelessness in forest fires later posters of the program featured uncle sam characters from the disney movie bambi and the official mascot of the u s forest service smokey bear 145 reducing human caused ignitions may be the most effective means of reducing unwanted wildfire alteration of fuels is commonly undertaken when attempting to affect future fire risk and behavior 33 wildfire prevention programs around the world may employ techniques such as wildland fire use wfu and prescribed or controlled burns 146 147 wildland fire use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn controlled burns are fires ignited by government agencies under less dangerous weather conditions 148 according to the united states fish and wildlife service in rugged steep or highly inaccessible terrain where people are not threatened wildland fire use can help avoid putting firefighters at unreasonable risk other objectives can include maintenance of healthy forests rangelands and wetlands and support of ecosystem diversity 149 a prescribed burn in a pinus nigra stand in portugal strategies for wildfire prevention detection control and suppression have varied over the years 150 one common and inexpensive technique to reduce the risk of uncontrolled wildfires is controlled burning intentionally igniting smaller less intense fires to minimize the amount of flammable material available for a potential wildfire 151 152 vegetation may be burned periodically to limit the accumulation of plants and other debris that may serve as fuel while also maintaining high species diversity 153 154 jan van wagtendonk a biologist at the yellowstone field station claims that wildfire itself is the most effective treatment for reducing a fire s rate of spread fireline intensity flame length and heat per unit of area 155 while other people claim that controlled burns and a policy of allowing some wildfires to burn is the cheapest method and an ecologically appropriate policy for many forests they tend not to take into account the economic value of resources that are consumed by the fire especially merchantable timber 102 some studies conclude that while fuels may also be removed by logging such thinning treatments may not be effective at reducing fire severity under extreme weather conditions 156 however multi agency studies conducted by the united states department of agriculture the u s forest service pacific northwest research station and the school of forestry and bureau of business and economic research at the university of montana through strategic assessments of fire hazards and the potential effectiveness and costs of different hazard reduction treatments clearly demonstrate that the most effective short and long term forest fire hazard reduction strategy and by far the most cost effective method to yield long term mitigation of forest fire risk is a comprehensive fuel reduction strategy that involves mechanical removal of overstocked trees through commercial logging and non commercial thinning with no restrictions on the size of trees that are removed resulting in considerably better long term results compared to a non commercial thin below operation or a commercial logging operation with diameter restrictions starting with a forest with a high risk of fire and a pre treatment crowning index of 21 the thin from below practice of removing only very small trees resulted in an immediate crowning index of 43 with 29 of the post treatment area rated low risk immediately and only 20 of the treatment area remaining low risk after 30 years at a cost net economic loss of 439 per acre treated again starting with a forest at high risk of fire and a crowning index of 21 the strategy involving non commercial thinning and commercial logging with size restrictions resulted in an crowning index of 43 immediately post treatment with 67 of the area considered low risk and 56 of the area remaining low risk after 30 years at a cost net economic loss of 368 per acre treated on the other hand starting with a forest at high risk of fire and the same crowning index of 21 a comprehensive fire hazard reduction treatment strategy without restrictions on size of trees removed resulted in an immediate crowning index of 61 post treatment with 69 of the treated area rated low risk immediately and 52 of the treated area remaining low risk after 30 years with positive revenue a net economic gain gain of 8 per acre 157 158 building codes in fire prone areas typically require that structures be built of flame resistant materials and a defensible space be maintained by clearing flammable materials within a prescribed distance from the structure 159 160 communities in the philippines also maintain fire lines 5 to 10 meters 16 to 33 ft wide between the forest and their village and patrol these lines during summer months or seasons of dry weather 161 continued residential development in fire prone areas and rebuilding structures destroyed by fires has been met with criticism 162 the ecological benefits of fire are often overridden by the economic and safety benefits of protecting structures and human life 163 detection edit see also remote sensing dry mountain fire lookout in the ochoco national forest oregon circa 1930 fast and effective detection is a key factor in wildfire fighting 164 early detection efforts were focused on early response accurate results in both daytime and nighttime and the ability to prioritize fire danger 165 fire lookout towers were used in the united states in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones carrier pigeons and heliographs 166 aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s however information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology early satellite derived fire analyses were hand drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager during the yellowstone fires of 1988 a data station was established in west yellowstone permitting the delivery of satellite based fire information in approximately four hours 165 currently public hotlines fire lookouts in towers and ground and aerial patrols can be used as a means of early detection of forest fires however accurate human observation may be limited by operator fatigue time of day time of year and geographic location electronic systems have gained popularity in recent years as a possible resolution to human operator error a government report on a recent trial of three automated camera fire detection systems in australia did however conclude detection by the camera systems was slower and less reliable than by a trained human observer these systems may be semi or fully automated and employ systems based on the risk area and degree of human presence as suggested by gis data analyses an integrated approach of multiple systems can be used to merge satellite data aerial imagery and personnel position via global positioning system gps into a collective whole for near realtime use by wireless incident command centers 167 a small high risk area that features thick vegetation a strong human presence or is close to a critical urban area can be monitored using a local sensor network detection systems may include wireless sensor networks that act as automated weather systems detecting temperature humidity and smoke 168 169 170 171 these may be battery powered solar powered or tree rechargeable able to recharge their battery systems using the small electrical currents in plant material 172 larger medium risk areas can be monitored by scanning towers that incorporate fixed cameras and sensors to detect smoke or additional factors such as the infrared signature of carbon dioxide produced by fires additional capabilities such as night vision brightness detection and color change detection may also be incorporated into sensor arrays 173 174 175 wildfires across the balkans in late july 2007 modis image global map of fire alerts on april 13 2021 available from global forest watch live updates satellite and aerial monitoring through the use of planes helicopter or uavs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large low risk areas these more sophisticated systems employ gps and aircraft mounted infrared or high resolution visible cameras to identify and target wildfires 176 177 satellite mounted sensors such as envisat s advanced along track scanning radiometer and european remote sensing satellite s along track scanning radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires identifying hot spots greater than 39 c 102 f 178 179 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s hazard mapping system combines remote sensing data from satellite sources such as geostationary operational environmental satellite goes moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr for detection of fire and smoke plume locations 180 181 however satellite detection is prone to offset errors anywhere from 2 to 3 kilometers 1 to 2 mi for modis and avhrr data and up to 12 kilometers 7 5 mi for goes data 182 satellites in geostationary orbits may become disabled and satellites in polar orbits are often limited by their short window of observation time cloud cover and image resolution may also limit the effectiveness of satellite imagery 183 global forest watch provides detailed daily updates on fire alerts these are sourced from nasa firms viirs active fires in 2015 a new fire detection tool is in operation at the u s department of agriculture usda forest service usfs which uses data from the suomi national polar orbiting partnership npp satellite to detect smaller fires in more detail than previous space based products the high resolution data is used with a computer model to predict how a fire will change direction based on weather and land conditions the active fire detection product using data from suomi npp s visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs increases the resolution

enables detection every 12 hours or less of much smaller fires and provides more detail and consistent tracking of fire lines during long duration wildfires capabilities critical for early warning systems and support of routine mapping of fire progression active fire locations are available to users within minutes from the satellite overpass through data processing facilities at the usfs remote sensing applications center which uses technologies developed by the nasa goddard space flight center direct readout laboratory in greenbelt maryland the model uses data on weather conditions and the land surrounding an active fire to predict 12 18 hours in advance whether a blaze will shift direction the state of colorado decided to incorporate the weather fire model in its firefighting efforts beginning with the 2016 fire season in 2014 an international campaign was organized in south africa s kruger national park to validate fire detection products including the new viirs active fire data in advance of that campaign the meraka institute of the council for scientific and industrial research in pretoria south africa an early adopter of the viirs 375 m fire product put it to use during several large wildfires in kruger the demand for timely high quality fire information has increased in recent years wildfires in the united states burn an average of 7 million acres of land each year for the last 10 years the usfs and department of interior have spent a combined average of about 2 4 billion annually on wildfire suppression suppression edit main article wildfire suppression see also firefighting a russian firefighter extinguishing a wildfire wildfire suppression depends on the technologies available in the area in which the wildfire occurs in less developed nations the techniques used can be as simple as throwing sand or beating the fire with sticks or palm fronds 184 in more advanced nations the suppression methods vary due to increased technological capacity silver iodide can be used to encourage snow fall 185 while fire retardants and water can be dropped onto fires by unmanned aerial vehicles planes and helicopters 186 187 complete fire suppression is no longer an expectation but the majority of wildfires are often extinguished before they grow out of control while more than 99 of the 10 000 new wildfires each year are contained escaped wildfires under extreme weather conditions are difficult to suppress without a change in the weather wildfires in canada and the us burn an average of 54 500 square kilometers 13 000 000 acres per year 188 189 above all fighting wildfires can become deadly a wildfire s burning front may also change direction unexpectedly and jump across fire breaks intense heat and smoke can lead to disorientation and loss of appreciation of the direction of the fire which can make fires particularly dangerous for example during the 1949 mann gulch fire in montana united states thirteen smokejumpers died when they lost their communication links became disoriented and were overtaken by the fire 190 in the australian february 2009 victorian bushfires at least 173 people died and over 2 029 homes and 3 500 structures were lost when they became engulfed by wildfire 191 costs of wildfire suppression edit the suppression of wild fires takes up a large amount of a country s gross domestic product which directly affects the country s economy 192 while costs vary wildly from year to year depending on the severity of each fire season in the united states local state federal and tribal agencies collectively spend tens of billions of dollars annually to suppress wildfires in the united states it was reported that approximately 6 billion was spent between 2004 2008 to suppress wildfires in the country 192 in california the u s forest service spends about 200 million per year to suppress 98 of wildfires and up to 1 billion to suppress the other 2 of fires that escape initial attack and become large 193 wildland firefighting safety edit wildfire fighters cutting down a tree using a chainsaw wildland firefighter working a brush fire in hopkinton new hampshire wildland fire fighters face several life threatening hazards including heat stress fatigue smoke and dust as well as the risk of other injuries such as burns cuts and scrapes animal bites and even rhabdomyolysis 194 195 between 2000 2016 more than 350 wildland firefighters died on duty 196 especially in hot weather conditions fires present the risk of heat stress which can entail feeling heat fatigue weakness vertigo headache or nausea heat stress can progress into heat strain which entails physiological changes such as increased heart rate and core body temperature this can lead to heat related illnesses such as heat rash cramps exhaustion or heat stroke various factors can contribute to the risks posed by heat stress including strenuous work personal risk factors such as age and fitness dehydration sleep deprivation and burdensome personal protective equipment rest cool water and occasional breaks are crucial to mitigating the effects of heat stress 194 smoke ash and debris can also pose serious respiratory hazards to wildland firefighters the smoke and dust from wildfires can contain gases such as carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and formaldehyde as well as particulates such as ash and silica to reduce smoke exposure wildfire fighting crews should whenever possible rotate firefighters through areas of heavy smoke avoid downwind firefighting use equipment rather than people in holding areas and minimize mop up camps and command posts should also be located upwind of wildfires protective clothing and equipment can also help minimize exposure to smoke and ash 194 firefighters are also at risk of cardiac events including strokes and heart attacks firefighters should maintain good physical fitness fitness programs medical screening and examination programs which include stress tests can minimize the risks of firefighting cardiac problems 194 other injury hazards wildland firefighters face include slips trips falls burns scrapes and cuts from tools and equipment being struck by trees vehicles or other objects plant hazards such as thorns and poison ivy snake and animal bites vehicle crashes electrocution from power lines or lightning storms and unstable building structures 194 firefighter safety zone guidelines edit the u s forest service publishes guidelines for the minimum distance a firefighter should be from a flame 197 as stated in the national wildfire coordinating group s incident response pocket guide a safety zone is an area where a firefighter can survive without a fire shelter and should be at least four times the maximum continuous flame height 198 however this figure only takes into account the effects of radiant heat and does not consider topography nor wind safety zones can natural features such as rock screes meadows and river bars or human made features such a parking lots or areas that have been cleared of vegetation through mechanical means fire retardants edit fire retardants are used to slow wildfires by inhibiting combustion they are aqueous solutions of ammonium phosphates and ammonium sulfates as well as thickening agents 199 the decision to apply retardant depends on the magnitude location and intensity of the wildfire in certain instances fire retardant may also be applied as a precautionary fire defense measure 200 typical fire retardants contain the same agents as fertilizers fire retardants may also affect water quality through leaching eutrophication or misapplication fire retardant s effects on drinking water remain inconclusive 201 dilution factors including water body size rainfall and water flow rates lessen the concentration and potency of fire retardant 200 wildfire debris ash and sediment clog rivers and reservoirs increasing the risk for floods and erosion that ultimately slow and or damage water treatment systems 201 202 there is continued concern of fire retardant effects on land water wildlife habitats and watershed quality additional research is needed however on the positive side fire retardant specifically its nitrogen and phosphorus components has been shown to have a fertilizing effect on nutrient deprived soils and thus creates a temporary increase in vegetation 200 the current usda procedure maintains that the aerial application of fire retardant in the united states must clear waterways by a minimum of 300 feet to safeguard effects of retardant runoff aerial uses of fire retardants are required to avoid application near waterways and endangered species plant and animal habitats after any incident of fire retardant misapplication the u s forest service requires reporting and assessment impacts be made to determine a mitigation remediation and or restrictions on future retardant uses in that area modeling edit fire propagation model main article wildfire modeling 2003 canberra firestorm wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildfires to comprehend and predict fire behavior 203 204 wildfire modeling aims to aid wildfire suppression increase the safety of firefighters and the public and minimize damage using computational science wildfire modeling involves the statistical analysis of past fire events to predict spotting risks and front behavior various wildfire propagation models have been proposed in the past including simple ellipses and egg and fan shaped models early attempts to determine wildfire behavior assumed terrain and vegetation uniformity however the exact behavior of a wildfire s front is dependent on a variety of factors including wind speed and slope steepness modern growth models utilize a combination of past ellipsoidal descriptions and huygens principle to simulate fire growth as a continuously expanding polygon 205 206 extreme value theory may also be used to predict the size of large wildfires however large fires that exceed suppression capabilities are often regarded as statistical outliers in standard analyses even though fire policies are more influenced by large wildfires than by small fires 207 human risk and exposure edit wildfire risk is the chance that a wildfire will start in or reach a particular area and the potential loss of human values if it does risk is dependent on variable factors such as human activities weather patterns availability of wildfire fuels and the availability or lack of resources to suppress a fire 208 wildfires have continually been a threat to human populations however human induced geographical and climatic changes are exposing populations more frequently to wildfires and increasing wildfire risk it is speculated that the increase in wildfires arises from a century of wildfire suppression coupled with the rapid expansion of human developments into fire prone wildlands 209 wildfires are naturally occurring events that aid in promoting forest health global warming and climate changes are causing an increase in temperatures and more droughts nationwide which contributes to an increase in wildfire risk 210 211 the 2009 station fire burns in the foothills of the san gabriel mountains above the jet propulsion laboratory near pasadena california airborne hazards edit see also health effects of wood smoke the most noticeable adverse effect of wildfires is the destruction of property however the release of hazardous chemicals from the burning of wildland fuels also significantly impacts health in humans 212 wildfire smoke is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor other common smoke components present in lower concentrations are carbon monoxide formaldehyde acrolein polyaromatic hydrocarbons and benzene 213 small particulates suspended in air which come in solid form or in liquid droplets are also present in smoke 80 90 of wildfire smoke by mass is within the fine particle size class of 2 5 micrometers in diameter or smaller 214 despite carbon dioxide s high concentration in smoke it poses a low health risk due to its low toxicity rather carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter particularly 2 5 µm in diameter and smaller have been identified as the major health threats 213 other chemicals are considered to be significant hazards but are found in concentrations that are too low to cause detectable health effects the degree of wildfire smoke exposure to an individual is dependent on the length severity duration and proximity of the fire people are exposed directly to smoke via the respiratory tract through inhalation of air pollutants indirectly communities are exposed to wildfire debris that can contaminate soil and water supplies the u s environmental protection agency epa developed the air quality index aqi a public resource that provides national air quality standard concentrations for common air pollutants the public can use this index as a tool to determine their exposure to hazardous air pollutants based on visibility range 215 fire ecologist leda kobziar found that wildfire smoke distributes microbial life on a global level 216 she stated there are numerous allergens that we ve found in the smoke and so it may be that some people who are sensitive to smoke have that sensitivity not only because of the particulate matter and the smoke but also because there are some biological organisms in it 217 water pollution edit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it january 2021 it is well known that debris and chemicals can runoff into waterways after wildfires making the drinking water sources unsafe it is also known that wildfires can damage water treatment facilities making drinking water unsafe though even when the water sources and treatment facilities are not damaged drinking water inside buildings and in buried water distribution systems can be chemically contaminated after the 2017 tubbs fire and 2018 camp fire in california hazardous waste levels of chemical contamination were found in multiple public drinking water systems impacted by wildfires 218 since 2018 additional wildfires that damaged drinking water distribution systems and plumbing in california and oregon have caused chemical drinking water contamination 219 benzene is one of many chemicals that has been found in the drinking water systems and buildings after wildfires benzene can permeate certain plastic pipes and thus require long times to remove from the water distribution system infrastructure and building plumbing using a u s environmental protection agency model 220 researchers estimated more than286 days of constant flushing a single contaminated pipe 24 hours per day 7 days a week were needed to reduce benzene below safe drinking water limits 221 temperature increases caused by fires including wildfires can cause plastic water pipes to generate toxic chemicals 222 such as benzene into the water that they carry 223 suspended sediment inputs to streams and reservoirs alter the colour and murkiness of water yet because of the chance of transporting particle associated pollutants elevated suspended sediment concentrations in drink will build it tough to notice microorganism and viruses increase microorganism development because of high quantities of adsorbate nutrients and reduce medical aid effectiveness sediment off the yucatan peninsula importantly composite suspended sediment particles instead of primary particles might dominate the transit of little cohesive sediments through the stream system microbial communities organic and inorganic particles and chemical components are all enclosed within the structure of those composite particles which may have a negative impact on water quality burned aggregates have a lot of bigger sinking velocities than change state particles of equal diameter which has been attributed to a rise in burned mixture density because of reduced organic content and pore house moreover the impact of soil heating has been ascribed to the aggregation of clay particles into coarser composite particles probably increasing the concentration of pollutants to composite particles relative to primary particles of equivalent size hyperbolic fine sediment storage and maybe delayed unharness of pollutants once fireplace from decaying aggregates are two potential implications of fireplace effects on soil particles 224 post fire risks edit charred shrubland in suburban sydney 2019 20 australian bushfires after a wildfire hazards remain residents returning to their homes may be at risk from falling fire weakened trees humans and pets may also be harmed by falling into ash pits the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc also reports that wildfires cause significant damage to electric systems especially in dry regions 225 other post fire risks can increase if other extreme weather follows for example wildfires make soil less able to absorb precipitation so heavy rainfall can result in more severe flooding and damages like mud slides 226 227 at risk groups edit firefighters edit firefighters are at the greatest risk for acute and chronic health effects resulting from wildfire smoke exposure due to firefighters occupational duties they are frequently exposed to hazardous chemicals at close proximity for longer periods of time a case study on the exposure of wildfire smoke among wildland firefighters shows that firefighters are exposed to significant levels of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants above osha permissible exposure limits pel and acgih threshold limit values tlv 5 10 are overexposed the study obtained exposure concentrations for one wildland firefighter over a 10 hour shift spent holding down a fireline the firefighter was exposed to a wide range of carbon monoxide and respiratory irritants a combination of particulate matter 3 5 µm and smaller acrolein and formaldehyde levels carbon monoxide levels reached up to 160ppm and the tlv irritant index value reached a high of 10 in contrast the osha pel for carbon monoxide is 30ppm and for the tlv respiratory irritant index the calculated threshold limit value is 1 any value above 1 exceeds exposure limits 228 between 2001 and 2012 over 200 fatalities occurred among wildland firefighters in addition to heat and chemical hazards firefighters are also at risk for electrocution from power lines injuries from equipment slips trips and falls injuries from vehicle rollovers heat related illness insect bites and stings stress and rhabdomyolysis 229 residents edit smoke from the 2020 california wildfires settles over san francisco residents in communities surrounding wildfires are exposed to lower concentrations of chemicals but they are at a greater risk for indirect exposure through water or soil contamination exposure to residents is greatly dependent on individual susceptibility vulnerable persons such as children ages 0 4 the elderly ages 65 and older smokers and pregnant women are at an increased risk due to their already compromised body systems even when the exposures are present at low chemical concentrations and for relatively short exposure periods 213 they are also at risk for future wildfires and may move away to areas they consider less risky 230 wildfires affect large numbers of people in western canada and the united states in california alone more than 350 000 people live in towns and cities in very high fire hazard severity zones 231 direct risks to building residents in fire prone areas can be moderated through design choices such as choosing fire resistant vegetation maintaining landscaping to avoid debris accumulation and to create firebreaks and by selecting fire retardant roofing materials potential compounding issues with poor air quality and heat during warmer months may be addressed with merv 11 or higher outdoor air filtration in building ventilation systems mechanical cooling and a provision of a refuge area with additional air cleaning and cooling if needed 232 health effects edit see also atmospheric particulate matter health effects of wood smoke and household air pollution health impacts animation of diaphragmatic breathing with the diaphragm shown in green wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes 233 inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard 234 wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i e carbon dioxide carbon monoxide water vapor particulate matter organic chemicals nitrogen oxides and other compounds the principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide 235 particulate matter pm is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets they are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle coarse pm fine pm and ultrafine pm coarse particles are between 2 5 micrometers and 10 micrometers fine particles measure 0 1 to 2 5 micrometers and ultrafine particle are less than 0 1 micrometer each size can enter the body through inhalation but the pm impact on the body varies by size coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation this can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing 236 237 coarse pm is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short term effects with stronger impact 237 smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream 236 237 in asthma patients pm2 5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells these particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function this damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised 237 the third pm type is ultra fine pm ufp ufp can enter the bloodstream like pm2 5 however studies show that it works into the blood much quicker the inflammation and epithelial damage done by ufp has also shown to be much more severe 237 pm2 5 is of the largest concern in regards to wildfire 233 this is particularly hazardous to the very young elderly and those with chronic conditions such as asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd cystic fibrosis and cardiovascular conditions the illnesses most commonly with exposure to the fine particles from wildfire smoke are bronchitis exacerbation of asthma or copd and pneumonia symptoms of these complications include wheezing and shortness of breath and cardiovascular symptoms include chest pain rapid heart rate and fatigue 236 asthma exacerbation edit smoke from wildfires can cause health problems especially for children and those who already have respiratory problems 238 several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma 233 an observational study of smoke exposure related to the 2007 san diego wildfires revealed an increase both in healthcare utilization and respiratory diagnoses especially asthma among the group sampled 238 projected climate scenarios of wildfire occurrences predict significant increases in respiratory conditions among young children 238 particulate matter pm triggers a series of biological processes including inflammatory immune response oxidative stress which are associated with harmful changes in allergic respiratory diseases 239 although some studies demonstrated no significant acute changes in lung function among people with asthma related to pm from wildfires a possible explanation for these counterintuitive findings is the increased use of quick relief medications such as inhalers in response to elevated levels of smoke among those already diagnosed with asthma 240 in investigating the association of medication use for obstructive lung disease and wildfire exposure researchers found increases both in the usage of inhalers and initiation of long term control as in oral steroids 240 more specifically some people with asthma reported higher use of quick relief medications inhalers 240 after two major wildfires in california researchers found an increase in physician prescriptions for quick relief medications in the years following the wildfires than compared to the year before each occurrence 240 there is consistent evidence between wildfire smoke and the exacerbation of asthma 240 fatal exposure edit asthma is one of the most common chronic disease among children in the united states affecting an estimated 6 2 million children 241 research on asthma risk focuses specifically on the risk of air pollution during the gestational period several pathophysiology processes are involved are in this considerable airway development occurs during the 2nd and 3rd trimester and continues until 3 years of age 242 it is hypothesized that exposure to these toxins during this period could have consequential effects as the epithelium of the lungs during this time could have increased permeability to toxins exposure to air pollution during parental and pre natal stage could induce epigenetic changes which are responsible for the development of asthma 243 studies have found significant association between pm2 5 no2 and development of asthma during childhood despite heterogeneity among studies 244 furthermore maternal exposure to chronic stressors is most likely present in distressed communities and as this can be correlated with childhood asthma it may further explain links between early childhood exposure to air pollution neighborhood poverty and childhood risk as well living in distressed neighborhoods is linked to pollutant source location and exposure and also to greater chronic individual stress which alters the allostatic load of the maternal immune system in turn this leads to adverse outcomes in children including increased susceptibility to air pollution 245 carbon monoxide danger edit main article carbon monoxide poisoning carbon monoxide co is a colorless odorless gas that can be found at the highest concentration at close proximity to a smoldering fire for this reason carbon monoxide inhalation is a serious threat to the health of wildfire firefighters co in smoke can be inhaled into the lungs where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and reduces oxygen delivery to the body s vital organs at high concentrations it can cause headaches weakness dizziness confusion nausea disorientation visual impairment coma and even death however even at lower concentrations such as those found at wildfires individuals with cardiovascular disease may experience chest pain and cardiac arrhythmia 213 a recent study tracking the number and cause of wildfire firefighter deaths from 1990 2006 found that 21 9 of the deaths occurred from heart attacks 246 another important and somewhat less obvious health effect of wildfires is psychiatric diseases and disorders both adults and children from countries ranging from the united states and canada to greece and australia who were directly and indirectly affected by wildfires were found by researchers to demonstrate several different mental conditions linked to their experience with the wildfires these include post traumatic stress disorder ptsd depression anxiety and phobias 247 248 249 250 251 epidemiology edit the western us has seen an increase in both the frequency and intensity of wildfires over the last several decades this increase has been attributed to the arid climate of the western us and the effects of global warming an estimated 46 million people were exposed to wildfire smoke from 2004 to 2009 in the western united states evidence has demonstrated that wildfire smoke can increase levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere 233 the epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air through the national ambient air quality standards and monitoring of ambient air quality has been mandated 252 due to these monitoring programs and the incidence of several large wildfires near populated areas epidemiological studies have been conducted and demonstrate an association between human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke the epa has defined acceptable concentrations of particulate matter in the air the national ambient air quality standards are part of the clean air act and provide mandated guidelines for pollutant levels and the monitoring of ambient air quality 252 in addition to these monitoring programs the increased incidence of wildfires near populated areas has precipitated several epidemiological studies such studies have demonstrated an association between negative human health effects and an increase in fine particulate matter due to wildfire smoke the size of the particulate matter is significant as smaller particulate matter fine is easily inhaled into the human respiratory tract often small particulate matter can be inhaled into deep lung tissue causing respiratory distress illness or disease 233 an increase in pm smoke emitted from the hayman fire in colorado in june 2002 was associated with an increase in respiratory symptoms in patients with copd 253 looking at the wildfires in southern california in october 2003 in a similar manner investigators have shown an increase in hospital admissions due to asthma symptoms while being exposed to peak concentrations of pm in smoke 254 another epidemiological study found a 7 2 95 confidence interval 0 25 15 increase in risk of respiratory related hospital admissions during smoke wave days with high wildfire specific particulate matter 2 5 compared to matched non smoke wave days 233 children participating in the children s health study were also found to have an increase in eye and respiratory symptoms medication use and physician visits 255 recently it was demonstrated that mothers who were pregnant during the fires gave birth to babies with a slightly reduced average birth weight compared to those who were not exposed to wildfire during birth suggesting that pregnant women may also be at greater risk to adverse effects from wildfire 256 worldwide it is estimated that 339 000 people die due to the effects of wildfire smoke each year 257 while the size of particulate matter is an important consideration for health effects the chemical composition of particulate matter pm2 5 from wildfire smoke should also be considered antecedent studies have demonstrated that the chemical composition of pm2 5 from wildfire smoke can yield different estimates of human health outcomes as compared to other sources of smoke 233 health outcomes for people exposed to wildfire smoke may differ from those exposed to smoke from alternative sources such as solid fuels history edit further information fossil record of fire elk bath an award winning photograph of elk avoiding a wildfire in montana the first evidence of wildfires is fossils of the giant fungi prototaxites preserved as charcoal discovered in south wales and poland dating to the silurian period about 430 million years ago 258 smoldering surface fires started to occur sometime before the early devonian period 405 million years ago low atmospheric oxygen during the middle and late devonian was accompanied by a decrease in charcoal abundance 259 260 additional charcoal evidence suggests that fires continued through the carboniferous period later the overall increase of atmospheric oxygen from 13 in the late devonian to 30 31 by the late permian was accompanied by a more widespread distribution of wildfires 261 later a decrease in wildfire related charcoal deposits from the late permian to the triassic periods is explained by a decrease in oxygen levels 262 wildfires during the paleozoic and mesozoic periods followed patterns similar to fires that occur in modern times surface fires driven by dry seasons clarification needed are evident in devonian and carboniferous progymnosperm forests lepidodendron forests dating to the carboniferous period have charred peaks evidence of crown fires in jurassic gymnosperm forests there is evidence of high frequency light surface fires 262 the increase of fire activity in the late tertiary 263 is possibly due to the increase of c4 type grasses as these grasses shifted to more mesic habitats their high flammability increased fire frequency promoting grasslands over woodlands 264 however fire prone habitats may have contributed to the prominence of trees such as those of the genera eucalyptus pinus and sequoia which have thick bark to withstand fires and employ pyriscence 265 266 human involvement edit see also control of fire by early humans deforestation historical causes environmental history history of firefighting and native american use of fire aerial view of deliberate wildfires on the khun tan range thailand these fires are lit by local farmers every year to promote the growth of a certain mushroom the human use of fire for agricultural and hunting purposes during the paleolithic and mesolithic ages altered the preexisting landscapes and fire regimes woodlands were gradually replaced by smaller vegetation that facilitated travel hunting seed gathering and planting 267 in recorded human history minor allusions to wildfires were mentioned in the bible and by classical writers such as homer however while ancient hebrew greek and roman writers were aware of fires they were not very interested in the uncultivated lands where wildfires occurred 268 269 wildfires were used in battles throughout human history as early thermal weapons from the middle ages accounts were written of occupational burning as well as customs and laws that governed the use of fire in germany regular burning was documented in 1290 in the odenwald and in 1344 in the black forest 270 in the 14th century sardinia firebreaks were used for wildfire protection in spain during the 1550s sheep husbandry was discouraged in certain provinces by philip ii due to the harmful effects of fires used in transhumance 268 269 as early as the 17th century native americans were observed using fire for many purposes including cultivation signaling and warfare scottish botanist david douglas noted the native use of fire for tobacco cultivation to encourage deer into smaller areas for hunting purposes and to improve foraging for honey and grasshoppers charcoal found in sedimentary deposits off the pacific coast of central america suggests that more burning occurred in the 50 years before the spanish colonization of the americas than after the colonization 271 in the post world war ii baltic region socio economic changes led more stringent air quality standards and bans on fires that eliminated traditional burning practices 270 in the mid 19th century explorers from hms beagle observed australian aborigines using fire for ground clearing hunting and regeneration of plant food in a method later named fire stick farming 272 such careful use of fire has been employed for centuries in the lands protected by kakadu national park to encourage biodiversity 273 wildfires typically occurred during periods of increased temperature and drought an increase in fire related debris flow in alluvial fans of northeastern yellowstone national park was linked to the period between ad 1050 and 1200 coinciding with the medieval warm period 274 however human influence caused an increase in fire frequency dendrochronological fire scar data and charcoal layer data in finland suggests that while many fires occurred during severe drought conditions an increase in the number of fires during 850 bc and 1660 ad can be attributed to human influence 275 charcoal evidence from the americas suggested a general decrease in wildfires between 1 ad and 1750 compared to previous years however a period of increased fire frequency between 1750 and 1870 was suggested by charcoal data from north america and asia attributed to human population growth and influences such as land clearing practices this period was followed by an overall decrease in burning in the 20th century linked to the expansion of agriculture increased livestock grazing and fire prevention efforts 276 a meta analysis found that 17 times more land burned annually in california before 1800 compared to recent decades 1 800 000 hectares year compared to 102 000 hectares year 277 according to a paper published in the journal science the number of natural and human caused fires decreased by 24 3 between 1998 and 2015 researchers explain this a transition from nomadism to settled lifestyle and intensification of agriculture that lead to a drop in the use of fire for land clearing 278 279 increases of certain tree species i e conifers over others i e deciduous trees can increase wildfire risk especially if these trees are also planted in monocultures 280 281 some invasive species moved in by humans i e for the pulp and paper industry have in some cases also increased the intensity of wildfires examples include species such as eucalyptus in california 282 283 and gamba grass in australia cultural aspects edit wildfires have a place in many cultures to spread like wildfire is a common idiom in english meaning something that quickly affects or becomes known by more and more people 284 the smokey bear fire prevention campaign has yielded one of the most popular characters in the united states for many years there was a living smokey bear mascot and it has been commemorated on postage stamps 285 wildfire activity has been attributed as a major factor in the development of ancient greece in modern greece as in many other regions it is the most common natural disaster and figures prominently in the social and economic lives of its people 286 in regards to communicating information to the public regarding wildfire safety some of the most effective ways to communicate with others about wildfires are community outreach conducted through presentations to homeowners and neighborhood associations community events such as festivals and county fairs and youth programs 287 see also edit

he first appeared in showcase 37 alongside his creations the metal men and was created by robert kanigher and ross andru 2 fictional character biography edit one of the most impressive geniuses of the dc universe with doctorates in theoretical mathematics mechanical engineering and particle physics william maxwell will magnus often offers scientific advice to other characters his greatest achievement is the one for which he first received renown the creation of the metal men the method through which doc magnus created the metal man has varied over years with various writers at first they were just blank slate robots with responsometers devices which generated their intelligence and personalities which just happened to be evocative of the metals from which they were formed 2 in an attempt to boost sales of the comic book the characters underwent vast changes the metal men all assumed human alter egos while doc magnus became a fugitive scientist dedicated to global conquest his personality change was credited to having been kidnapped reawakened and brainwashed by a mad dictator sales plunged instead and the comic was not printed for a few years eventually metal men was picked up again with doc s sanity restored and he returned to assist his metal men at one point he saved doom patrol s robotman whose original body had been destroyed by madame rouge doc magnus recovered robotman s brain and built him a new cybernetic body in 1993 a four part metal men miniseries retconned much of their backstory it was revealed that the responsometers were not responsible for the metal men s sentience and that the metal men actually were imprinted with the intellects and personalities of real people magnus own brother mike his fiancee sharon two lab workers redmond wilde and randy pressman a janitor named thomas tinkham and a pizza delivery man named jack these unfortunate personalities were accidentally transferred to blank robots in a lab accident at the climax of the miniseries gold one of his robots was permanently killed and doc magnus mortally wounded doc permanently transferred his personality into a blank robot known as veridium made of a green alien metal becoming the new robotic leader of the metal men 52 edit with the advent of identity crisis gold is back and doc magnus is once again human and played an active role in the series 52 as revealed during infinite crisis when superboy prime pounded on the walls of reality he caused the very fabric of reality to shift changing and merging histories the blank robots with responsometers origin is said to be the definitive origin while the human personalities origin and the 1993 miniseries has been described as the byproduct of a mental breakdown suffered by magnus when booster gold visited asking for help with skeets magnus commented that the metal men don t quite work anymore the responsometers are now described as containing an artificial soul invented by doc magnus as inspired by t o morrow who is revealed to have taught him at college and to have been the only one not to laugh at magnus s theories after the unexplained dismantling of the metal men doc magnus is unable to recreate these souls and restore their personalities he now takes prozac for the bipolar disorder which caused his nervous breakdown and the depression which led to the creation of the plutonium man a tremendous nearly indestructible superweapon based upon the metal men but with magnus then own deranged twisted worldview as its operating system it is implied that although the medication is keeping magnus from doing anything irrational it is also deadening his imagination and creativity and that this is the reason he cannot recreate the metal men magnus is approached by government agents hoping to use the metal men as soulless smart weapons an offer magnus rejects through all of this magnus visits morrow in his cell in haven morrow warns magnus that there have been numerous abductions of mad scientists including doctor sivana whose lair magnus investigates eventually morrow himself disappears leaving a note for his former student with a string in machine code using the code magnus is able to revive mercury but his robotic friend and creation is apparently destroyed again while trying to save him from the conspiracy trying to kidnap every mad scientist in the dcu during week 22 mindless replicas of the metal men force magnus to escape from his burned house before he is captured by what is revealed to be a separate group chang tzu s science squad 3 this would be the second time magnus has confronted chang tzu a previous incarnation of the villain once managed to brainwash the metal men but their loyalty to magnus restored their rightful minds 2 this group is based on oolong island said to be part of the territory of china and has been responsible for the disappearing scientists including professor morrow the group is being financed by intergang with the collusion it is implied of the chinese government the assembled scientists have been given unlimited budgets to invent various super weapons including in particular various types of robots during week 23 a giant robot piloted by animals from intergang delivers doc magnus to oolong island 4 magnus is assigned to design and construct a new plutonium man robot but deliberately makes little progress saying to morrow that the original plutonium man was an expression of his pain and rage brought on by his mental illness and that the reason he takes his medication is to prevent himself from doing something like that again morrow reveals this to the island s leaders and magnus s medication is confiscated magnus then proceeds to work on plutonium man saying this time he will do it right though he is unstable due to his lack of medication magnus is not fully co operating with chang tzu magnus goes about scavenging materials from various items gold from a gold watch lead from lead shielding mercury from thermometers and tin from cans of baked beans which he adopts as his sole diet presumably in order to ensure the other scientists will not want to spend too much time with him as well this allows him to reconstruct his metal men albeit only a few inches high these new metal men are shown to help magnus remain sane despite being off his pills such as when they persuade him to deactivate the now completed plutonium man after he turns it on during a period of depression ooolong island is attacked by the jsa seeking to rescue black adam and chang tzu orders the plutonium man activated chang notes that he has been spying on magnus and knows that several metals have entered the lab and not come back out the metal men attack chang tzu allowing magnus to escape and switch off the island s defenses while he does this morrow confronts magnus and destroys mercury yet again magnus explains to morrow why it s pointless to stop him from deactivating the shields as the jsa will get in eventually and instead offers him the chance to teleport out saying that morrow was the best teacher i ever knew and that he tries to over look the psychopathic super villain thing morrow accepts the offer magnus is then confronted by chang tzu whom he apparently kills with the aid of lead and what he describes as a particle wave ray gun magnus also indicates this shooting was a result of his irrationality brought on by the lack of his medications magnus then surrenders to the jsa with all charges against him dropped due to being coerced into collaboration will magnus returns to his home and laboratory there when booster gold visits him again exactly one year after their last meeting with a salvaged responsometer containing skeets memself asking him to somehow restore the robot destroyed by mister mind magnus agrees he reveals to have in his possession a copy of skeets memories and so he is able to rebuild him as a security droid 2 0 slightly more advanced but oblivious of the events of the past years now sane again he returns to working on his metal men superman batman edit in the superman batman series doc magnus is shown working again with his metal men he has even built a new one the spunky and wisecracking gynoid copper despite contrary advice from his fiancée he asks bruce wayne for a tryout of his metal men as security guards the trial is successful but the metal men fail on the field due to mistrust by the human personnel and brainiac s influence leaving doc magnus the responsibility of saving the day 5 jla edit magnus has recently assisted the justice league of america with the rebuilding of red tornado after red tornado s first intended body is stolen by amazo he is called on again to provide red tornado with yet another new body more powerful and advanced than the previous one despite his good intentions the attempts comes to another downfall and almost spells his death when amazo returns to claim the newer and stronger body for himself metal men 2009 edit the metal men are later restored as a second feature in the revamped doom patrol 5th series written by keith giffen now living in simple suburbia in kanigher street the metal men seem to be affected by his currently partly deranged state of mind iron seems unaffected gold is now humorously self obsessed and magniloquent platina is lovesick lead is dimwitted and prone to errors tin is always scared and affected by chronic self esteem issues and mercury once brilliant and humorous has now developed the same bipolar disturbance affecting will magnus himself and refuses to take medications copper the newest and seventh member is disturbingly ignored by her teammates who often refuse to acknowledge her presence despite being side by side with her the new 52 edit in the new 52 timeline will magnus is first mentioned in the forever evil storyline a rebuilt cyborg heads out to find will magnus so that he can learn about his metal men project 6 meeting with will magnus cyborg learns that he can not help him magnus tells him the history of the metal men project how they were built to execute search and rescue missions that humans could not tackle after he was able to get them online the government went back on their word and chose to have the metal men become assassins the metal men hid at magnus apartment where they help protect magnus and the population from an experiment gone wrong destroying themselves in the process seeing their responsometers that control them in magnus lab cyborg senses that their minds and hearts are still active encouraging magus to activate them once more to help him 7 when the conner kent version of superboy shows up asking for help superman gathers all the geniuses he knows including but not limited to mister terrific batman ted kord and will magnus examination of conner leads the group to ponder evidence that the universe has been rebooted at least three times 8 powers and abilities edit while human doc magnus had no special abilities aside from his great intellect his vast intelligence was responsible for the creation of the metal men along with various other robots while he was veridium magnus was the most powerful of the metal men he could store and channel heat and energy 9 other versions edit in the amalgam comics universe will magnus jealous of his brother erik for constantly outshining his

rational man like himself could do something so violent by the present his metal men framed his universe s justice league for the deaths of various scientists and forced them out of their base so he can use superman s ship and a series of miniature boom tubes to plant nanites in the minds of every human on earth connecting them to a collective consciousness however lex luthor discovered and

was created by jerry siegel and jim mooney bouncing boy s addition to the legion of super heroes reflected siegel s interest in comedy and provided a vehicle for humor 2 fictional character biography edit silver age edit chuck taine was born on earth with no powers 3 he received his ability to inflate when he accidentally drank a super plastic formula which he thought was soda pop he applied for membership in the legion of super heroes but was at first rejected 4 after he used his new power to defeat a robber using electric weaponry which did not affect him because his bouncing kept him from being grounded he was admitted and took the codename bouncing boy with his good humor wit and charm taine appointed himself the legion s morale officer 5 bouncing boy once lost his powers while bouncing in front of a matter shrinking machine and was forced to resign from the legion he regained his powers again temporarily when the legion faced computo for the first time and one of fellow legionnaire triplicate girl s bodies was killed 6 his powers left him again for a short period of time but were restored once more by dr zan orbal of evillo s devil s dozen where he happily rejoined the team bouncing boy became a teacher at the legion academy and had a solo victory against the hunter this boosted chuck s confidence and after once again losing his powers he proposed to triplicate girl now known as duo damsel the two quickly married on mars at nix olympia superboy 200 7 and both retired from the legion because of the rule that legionnaires could not be married that rule was later overturned but the couple decided to remain as legion reserves once again bouncing boy s powers returned and the duo damsel settled on the colony world of wondil ix after helping the legion on a few occasional missions the pair returned to earth to become the headmasters of the legion academy they later went on to found the second legion of substitute heroes alongside reservists cosmic boy and night girl in the post zero hour continuity chuck was identified as charles foster taine and acted as the legion s resident architect and engineer he did not possess bouncing powers in this continuity and was only an honorary member of the legion as a maintenance man he once built a specialty vehicle called the bouncing boy which acted as a bouncing juggernaut smashing everything in its way 1 the name charles foster taine is a reference to the classic 1941 feature film citizen kane and its title character charles foster kane though in his initial appearance he is simply named chuck taine original research he has yet to appear in the threeboot version of the legion which began in 2004 the post infinite crisis version of bouncing boy appeared in final crisis legion of 3 worlds missing in action during most of the miniseries he and his wife now known as duplicate damsel finally make an appearance in the final issue to help end the battle against the antagonists and then rejoin the legion reboot earth 247 edit on earth 247 chuck taine never gained super powers but was a valuable ally of the legion his parents had been killed by daxamite terrorists during an attack on earth and with their life insurance money he was able to put himself through school to become an architect he designed and helped rebuild the legion headquarters after it took damage from chronos at one point chuck helped repel protean invaders and was around the legion full time repairing brainiac five s laboratory and other structural damage he became close friends with fellow legion staffer tenzil kem had a crush on triad and once went on a friendly date with shrinking violet chuck remained on the legion staff and eventually designed the legion outpost an orbiting space station retroboot new earth edit infinite crisis restored a close analogue of the original legion to continuity shortly after the magic wars chuck is once more an instructor alongside his wife luornu at the legion academy and a legion reservist after his wife s second body was killed this time she developed the power to duplicate an unlimited number of copies of herself they discovered this ability while the taines were on their third honeymoon and then quickly came running when the team sent out a distress call for help against superboy prime and his legion of super villains bouncing boy is currently helping to train the next class of students at legion academy in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock bouncing boy is among the legion of super heroes members that appear in the present after doctor manhattan undid the experiment that erased the legion of super heroes and the justice society of america 8 notable story arcs edit when the legion was disbanded following the blight invasion of earth chuck stayed with a small team of covert legionnaires led by cosmic boy with the legion s benefactor r j brande chuck helped with the construction of a new secret headquarters known as legion world chuck was given an honorary membership and built a ship called the bouncing boy that could ram other objects without taking structural damage chuck was given the job of chief engineer of legion world and worked frequently with the cyborg legionnaire gear he was originally seen as being sent into the time stream with the rest of the legion shortly before earth 247 was destroyed but didn t re surface during the legion of three worlds event chuck may then have been wiped from continuity powers and abilities edit bouncing boy has the ability to expand his body into a spherical form which provides him with bouncing capabilities in this normal form bouncing boy is overweight but when he inflates his mass and height remain the same size while these overall dimensions increase into resembling that of a human sized ball whether his body actually inflates as in takes in air or his individual cells expand which decreases his overall density cannot be explained when he utilizes his own body it becomes extremely rubbery and elastic allowing him to bounce off surfaces with great force originally thought of as a useless power by his legionnaire peers he have demonstrated many times that he can use its shape and rubber like consistency as an effective ballistic weapon his go to move was to ricochet back and forth up on surrounding walls even when bowling over the opponents this also provides him with a limited degree of invulnerability and resistant to electric shocks unlike an inanimate rubber ball that will slowly lose its kinetic energy due to friction and gravity bouncing boy maintains his velocity as he bounces about 9 bouncing boy lost his powers for a short period of time after he accidentally bounced into the matter shrinking facility this caused chuck to lose them which resulted in him being stepped down from the legion of super heroes he later regained these abilities after the original formula was recreated for him 10 he then rejoined the team eight years later he lost his powers again for no apparent reason 11 he resigned once more and married duo damsel 12 he again regained these abilities 13 chuck taine of earth 247 has no powers but is a gifted engineer and architect he built and pilots his own spaceship known as the bouncing boy 14 equipment edit as a legion of super heroes member bouncing boy possesses his own legion flight ring it gives him the ability to fly its speed and range of which is determined by his willpower it also acts as a long range communicator enabling constant vocal contact with other legionnaires even across vast distances of space signal device and navigational compass all powered by its micro computer built inside the ring in other media edit bouncing boy made a cameo in the superman the animated series

history being rebooted during a battle with glorith a time warping sorceress brainiac 5 was rapidly aged into a weathered enfeebled older man due to the trauma of this rapid aging brainiac s already prickly personality took a turn for the worse and he became colder more clinical and even amoral when the legion was forced to go on the run as fugitives after being framed by universo and the khund empire brainiac wore a high tech combat suit to protect his ravaged new body and went by the simpler moniker of 5 when zero hour befell the legion brainiac 5 redoubled his efforts to save the

entropy and their timeline was rebooted zero hour reboot continuity 1994 2004 edit main article legion of super heroes 1994 team following the zero hour event and the rebooting of the legion the new brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues he barely interacted with the other legionnaires although he was still somewhat attracted to laurel gand now called andromeda who was now also something of an outsider when andromeda was believed killed he was the only person who really missed her a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion 9 it was later revealed that even amongst coluans querl dox had been something of a loner due to his even higher intelligence interest in practical experiments rather than pure thought and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments it was also revealed that his mother brainiac 4 had abandoned him at birth having no emotional attachment whatsoever to her newborn child 10 as a child he was cared for by robots and given almost no contact with other living people developing no social skills having created a method of traveling back to the 20th century leading to the legion s rescue of valor brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time travel he was later pardoned when r j brande became president of the united planets in addition to having a crush on andromeda brainiac 5 had a secret stash of lustful holo collection featuring andromeda herself dreamer nura nal spark ayla ranzz and another fellow legionary whose alias begins with in obviously invisible kid lyle norg and probably others 11 before that in a moment of rare emotional outburst brainy kisses lyle s cheek as he finds him again and right after he feels embarrassed 12 trapped in the 20th century edit brainiac 5 was one of a number of legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century he spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment he finally produced a computer capable of doing this utilizing a 30th century omnicom a new gods mother box loaned to him by metron and the responsometer of veridium of the metal men unfortunately this became the post zero hour c o m p u t o the legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time while in the 20th century he also encountered his ancestors brainiac and vril dox ii as well as the post crisis supergirl ironically he was attracted to supergirl due to her similarity to andromeda some stories suggested that brainiac 5 s attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth 10 13 upgrade brainiac 5 1 edit upon his return he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly the anomaly upgraded him he was now more considerate of others and had vastly improved people skills he also internalized his force shield apparatus following his return from the space anomaly a friendship was formed with his teammate gates who dubbed the improved querl dox brainiac 5 1 a name he adopted 14 shortly after that the legion investigated the criminal terrorist organization called the dark circle querl learned his mother brainiac 4 was the leader of the dark circle having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions 15 the shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former distant self although he did not revert he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again he also began researching without considering the consequences again inadvertently transforming the team into a bizarro legion 16 legion lost edit main article legion lost brainiac 5 1 was amongst the legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the stargate network was shut down they spent a year travelling through the lost galaxy during this time he felt a great amount of stress as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation as he eventually confessed to saturn girl he did not have a clue how to get them home or even where home was relative to their location in the same conversation he also complained that he d always hated his name upgrade and on the way out as well as reassuring him she made a point of redubbing him brainiac five and he dropped the 1 from his name thereafter 17 eventually using his teammate shikari s tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they d earlier found but been forced to leave he did get them home upon their return brainiac began developing a replacement for the stargates based on the threshold doorway they had used to return from the lost galaxy restoring the connection to the planet xanthu they learned that it had been at war with robotica the robot homeworld until they mysteriously disappeared robotica s leader was revealed as c o m p u t o a strike team was launched against it but brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself so it no longer sought vengeance 18 it was revealed that the coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence however and brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine life from destruction 19 dc one million edit main article dc one million during the reboot legion s heyday they are tangentially involved in the dc one million crossover where the audience is shown the justice legion l of the 853rd century loosely based on members of the legion of the 31st century the justice legion l are tasked with protecting the remains of the united planets by that point reduced to a small system of worlds joined together by a powerful magnetic core centered on braal several of the planets involved had actually merged to form new symbiotic worlds including colu bgztl the justice legion l includes brainiac 417 a counterpart to brainiac 5 who is from this particular combined world as with all members of his race he combines super intelligence with an ephemeral intangible state brainiac 417 appears to be a shimmering green brain inside a transparent humanoid body his race are purported to have become beings of pure intelligence and thought brainiac 417 is not the leader of the justice legion l that duty fell to cosmicbot but is one of the most valuable members and is shown to have integrated his technologies to the point where he can jump back a thousand years to recruit an earlier version of superboy for the purposes of saving the day threeboot continuity 2004 2009 edit main article legion of super heroes 2004 team cover to legion of super heroes vol 5 1 2005 art by barry kitson in volume 5 of the legion of super heroes title brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor vril dox ii in l e g i o n he is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially but is more politically savvy he has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting legion leader cosmic boy who suspects him of planning a coup he also has problems with dream girl as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means brainy was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry when she was killed during terror firma s attack on the legion hq on earth he became obsessed with outthinking death in a botched experiment to restore her to life he however manages to store her consciousness in his own subconscious mind enabling the girl to interact with him in his dreams and keep using her precognition in his behalf following cosmic boy s disappearance brainiac 5 has become the advisor to legion leader supergirl and later to lightning lad brainiac 5 eventually proposes to dream girl after spending the night together in which dream girl inhabited the body of a spiritualist however on the same night princess projectra has her own urges and primal repressed emotion viciously attack dream girl upon her return to querl s mind viciously beating her and gouging out her eyes leaving the girl blind and powerless thus hoping to strip brainiac 5 of her constant counseling 20 he much later manages to turn their dream into reality when forced to rebuild new bodies for his teammates mangled to shreds by a race of digitalized aliens while connected to the cyberspace creates a new body for dream girl imprinting her personality into the cloned body successful in his attempt that despite nura s previsions even restored her lost sight brainiac 5 happily extends to all the legionnaires his invitation to their marriage holding hands with his resurrected soon to be bride 21 unbeknownst to brainiac 5 the dark side of his mind the avatar of his repressed urges and dark feelings was granted a physical body by princess projectra and sent to the physical body 20 post infinite crisis 2007 edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics this incarnation of the legion shares roughly the same history as the original legion up to the events of crisis on infinite earths 22 the lightning saga edit main article the lightning saga the original brainiac 5 from the pre crisis universe briefly appeared in the justice league justice society lightning saga crossover he was revealed as the mastermind behind the legion s plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to the flash at the end of the storyline brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the legionnaires used on 21st century earth and told his teammates that the legion had gotten what it came for this brainiac 5 s agenda does not end there however in the pages of countdown una arrived in the present to stop karate kid from returning to the 31st century explaining that brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day superman and the legion of super heroes edit main article superman and the legion of super heroes in this follow up story to the lightning saga taking place in action comics 858 863 brainiac 5 is masquerading as a tyrannical dictator of colu but only to delay colu which is the strategical beachhead of a united planets attack on earth and keep them from completing their calculations brainiac still possesses the lightning rod and states that the person inside is crucial to stopping the crisis of the 31st century however his ruse is discovered and brainiac leaves with the legion with only four hours until the united planets go to war 23 after superman and the legion defeat earthman and his justice league of earth and convince the armada to stand down brainiac 5 tells superman that the legion will not forget him this time final crisis legion of three worlds edit main article final crisis legion of three worlds in this final crisis tie in brainiac 5 is driven to the breaking point after being banished by colu and by earth s continued xenophobia he considers leaving the legion but is convinced to remain as a way to prove all his naysayers wrong when superboy prime attacks takron galtos and frees the legion of super villains brainiac 5 informs his fellow legionnaires of his plan to recruit their post zero hour and threeboot selves to help 24 his plan succeeds and brainiac meets his alternate selves from two other realities the threeboot version of brainiac refuses to work with his older self due to his rebellious nature while the post zero hour version sees his older counterpart as wiser and more experienced and tries to mediate between his alternate selves 25 despite their differences all three versions of brainiac 5 work together to set in motion the final phases of the original brainiac s master contingency plan against superboy prime this plan which involved the resurrections of superboy prime foes bart allen kid flash whose essence was in the lightning rod and conner kent superboy was devised long ago when brainiac 5 was forewarned of prime s arrival by one of dream girl s prophesies the new 52 edit brainiac 5 seems to be largely unaffected by the changes of the flashpoint miniseries as is true for the legion of super heroes as a whole however the term brainiac is no longer his name but an honorable title 26 this adds understanding to the opening arcs of action comics vol 2 2011 by grant morrison where an alien is stealing and bottling cities an act usually committed by brainiac but is here only named the collector dc rebirth edit a younger brainiac 5 appears briefly during justice league vol 3 2017 by bryan hitch though unconnected to the legion he is also not referred to by his name only as the brainy kid by cyborg after analyzing the timeless technology with specialized contacts he lends cyborg his prototype flight bracelet marked with the brainiac sigil so the league member can reach the weapon in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock brainiac 5 is among the legion of super heroes members that appear in the present after doctor manhattan undid the experiment that erased the legion of super heroes and the justice society of america 27 powers and abilities edit brainiac 5 possesses a twelfth level intellect which grants him superhuman calculation skills amazing memory and exceptional technical knowledge by comparison the 20th century earth as whole constitutes a sixth level intellect and most of his fellow coluans have an eighth level intellect the 31st century earth as whole is a ninth level intellect his incredible memory allows him to retain the knowledge of events that all others forget such as their first meeting with three different legions 28 the post zero hour version of brainiac 5 was shown in several issues to be able to ponder twelve lines of thought simultaneously 29 when a renegade titanian read his mind she discovered that his subconscious usually more active and chaotic part of the mind was less active than twelve simultaneous conscious thoughts whether any other version of brainiac also exhibits this trait remains to be seen 10 equipment edit since brainiac 5 processes a superhuman intelligent mind he built numerous devices to aid himself and his fellow legionnaires in their missions his primary role have always been that of a scientist the legion flight ring is one of his most important inventions which it had significant roles in over these various adventures 30 another invention a force field belt that proves useful to him and remained his main method for self defense in cases where he found himself battle in every version of the legion 31 in recent issues of the legion of super heroes brainiac 5 s signature invention the force field belt was now being called as an irreplaceable piece of his family history by brainiac 5 himself 32 in various storylines another invention of his is the super computer c o m p u t o this machine had been included in most versions of the legion but always reworked in a storyline to suit the situation required for brainiac 5 modified his time sphere into the time bubble and with it he can travel through time to send or bring other dc characters to or from the 31st century other methods of space travel have included these devices such as the development on threshold technology 33 and a wormhole conduit teleporter 34 not all of brainiac 5 s inventions have proved useful to the legion both versions of c o m p u t o each proved to be among his worst mistakes while not a product of his own research but rather stolen data brainiac 5 also managed to create bizarro versions of many legion members 35 in other media edit television edit brainiac 5 made a non voiced cameo appearance in superman the animated series in the episode new kids in town he chats with teammate triplicate girl at the time of his debut it was unclear if he in fact used his given name or had any connections to brainiac however his costume included a chest symbol comprising three circles forming an inverted triangle this closely resembled the discs on the animated brainiac s forehead and his icon when he was a computer program suggesting some kind of connection between them it was revealed on commentary on the superman the animated series vol 3 dvd box set that this character was in fact brainiac 5 brainiac 5 appears in justice league unlimited voiced by matt czuchry like his comic book counterpart brainiac 5 wears his trademark force field belt which protects him from the fatal five s attack it is revealed that brainiac learned to pass its code biologically and created brainiac 5 as an organic being his physical appearance is also reminiscent of static shock character richie gear foley unfortunately for brainiac brainiac 5 rejected evil and joined the legion of super heroes in the episode far from home he brings green arrow supergirl and green lantern into the future to help him battle the fatal five in the short time after meeting each other brainiac 5 and supergirl fall in love after the fatal five are defeated supergirl chooses to remain in the future with him and the legion though superman did ask green arrow and green lantern whom supergirl was seeing in that time brainiac 5 appears in legion of super heroes voiced by adam wylie he is a core member of the legion of super heroes this version is coluan a nano based cybernetic organism that not only possesses 12th level intelligence but can assume a human like form his human like form can also alter its shape to create tools and weapons or transform into a large battle robot form much like the reboot legion member gear his ai core is based on the original brainiac 1 0 from whom he tries to distance himself as best as possible unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling this version is considerably more emotional in the first season he often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates particularly the original superman brainiac 5 unlike his villainous ancestor idolizes superman however his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict for example he idolizes superman but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for superman once he is returned to his own time as superman s knowledge of his future events could change what is for the legion history in the second season episodes chained lightning and message in a bottle brainiac 5 grows close to shrinking violet however as the series ended it remains unknown if this was an intended romance or not he seems to have feelings for superman himself because of the simulation he produced that involved him and superman shown at the premiere of season two and many other incidents in the series in the second season premiere superman x a clone of superman from the 41st century hints that someday brainiac 5 will be responsible for something terrible in the future the starting phase occurs in message in a bottle when brainiac 5 was forced to tap into the data of brainiac who had been observing brainiac 5 since he came online brainiac 5 travels within himself to meet with his ancestor where he is offered data from the original brainiac brainiac 5 forcefully accepts the gift of data he needed to stop imperiex from his ancestor who hinted it to open new avenues of possibilities soon after using the info he obtained to save kandor and restore it to original size brainiac 5 begins to suffer data corruption as imperiex intended from the start becoming cold and unfeeling in the process once completely under his ancestor s influence during the dark victory series finale brainiac 5 assumes a new form in homage to his ancestor and leaves the legion to join imperiex s army taking command after killing imperiex once overpowering the hivemind on his homeworld of colu with his will brainiac 5 intends to bring order to the universe destroying any who interfere thanks to superman and superman x brainiac 5 managed to regain control over himself and overpower his ancestor in the process brainiac 5 becomes a pure organic being as he discards his robotic armor to cope with this new state and his recent actions

psychiatry scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of psychotic personality traits in the study researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from australia britain and the

of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non creative jobs gordon claridge a professor of experimental psychology at the university of oxford and leader of the study claimed the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 17 however labeling comedians personality traits as psychotic does not mean that individual is a psychopath 18 19 since psychopathy is distinct from psychosis and neither does it mean their behavior is

legion of super heroes to help them destroy the sun eater threatening earth the emerald empress mano the persuader and validus led by tharok subsequently formed an alliance after it was successfully stopped 3 though they were offered pardons for their assistance the five rejected them and banded together confident that they are powerful enough to try to conquer the worlds they had saved and subsequently clashed with the legion many times 2 a later incarnation consisted of the emerald empress the persuader flare a rimborian with the power of fire caress who had a deadly acidic touch and mentalla a legion reject who was secretly working against the five trying to secure a spot in the legion the first storyline in legionnaires 1993 had the sw6 legion face a fatal five comprising tharok mano the persuader a new emerald empress and a monstrous being called mordecai zero hour edit following the zero hour legion reboot the original fatal five was reintroduced in legion of super heroes vol 4 78 1996 again assembled to help fight the sun eater although it was later revealed that the sun eater did not exist notably in this incarnation the analogue of the emerald empress is simply called the empress and is more a skilled melee combatant than a magic user since this continuity s emerald eye is a sentient being with a will unto itself and a role in other developing storylines in the teen titans legion of super heroes crossover the persuader used his atomic axe to bring fatal five teams from other dimensions forming the fatal five hundred 4 before the two teams are able to use the cosmic treadmill to banish the alternate fatal fives back to their original universes 5 one year later edit the fatal five has not been seen in the threeboot legion setting but in the brave and the bold a version of the team was taken to the present day by the lord of time to assist him in gaining a powerful weapon when his plans were foiled by batman and the blue beetle he abandoned them in the 21st century after batman and tharok were accidentally merged into one being the group was returned to the future where they appear to be already in the legion s prison final crisis edit all five fatal five members were among the supervillains in superman prime s legion of super villains dc rebirth edit in dc rebirth the emerald empress comes to the 21st century to destroy saturn girl only to also fight supergirl to combat supergirl after failing to take her down on her own she forms the 21st century version of the fatal five consisting of magog indigo and the sorceress selena in addition selena strengthens the fatal five by creating a mindless clone of solomon grundy the fatal five then begin their attack on supergirl after breaking indigo supergirl thwarts the emerald empress plot where she fades away to the future causing the people of national city to think that supergirl killed her 6 members edit emerald empress edit main article emerald empress mano edit mano is a mutant born with the power to disintegrate anything that he touches with his right hand with his anti matter touch a native of the polluted world angtu mano must wear an environment suit because he can not breathe the atmosphere of most other planets the suit s helmet obscures his face so that it can only be seen as a silhouette hating his people for mistreating him mano decided to destroy them all by touching the ground and straining his power to the utmost he obliterated his planet causing it to explode considered one of the worst murderers in the galaxy mano was recruited by the legion themselves to help defeat the sun eater after which he continued his criminal career mainly as a member of the fatal five 2 persuader nyeun chun ti edit the persuader came from a heavy gravity planet as a result all of his physical capabilities such as strength and endurance are greatly enhanced before becoming a supervillain he was a gangland enforcer who gained his name from his ability to thoroughly intimidate his victims 7 the persuader wields an atomic axe on a long shaft resembling a halberd this axe could reportedly cut through anything occasionally including purely metaphoric or intangible things such as a person s air supply the force of gravity or the separation between dimensions and followed the persuader s mental commands 8 tharok edit tharok is the leader of the fatal five 9 10 tharok is a small time crook who tries to impress his bosses by stealing a small nuclear device it detonates unexpectedly when the local police fire on him vaporizing one half of his body 11 the people of his world holding life sacred rebuild him using robotic parts this boosts his intelligence dramatically but leaves his evil tendencies unchecked in his early appearances he wore clothing that only covered the organic half of his body tharok s cyborg brain also allows him to control validus the mindless monster member of the fatal five 2 one of the fatal five s main attempts to defeat the legion is masterminded by the dark man the being who organized several teenage refugees from the planet dryad into the league of super assassins 12 during this time period it is revealed that the dark man is actually a clone of tharok grown from tissue removed from tharok s body during his cyborg reconstruction when the scheme to destroy the legion fails both tharok and the dark man are seemingly destroyed 13 and the fatal five eventually disband 14 post zero hour edit following the zero hour legion reboot tharok is introduced in legionnaires 34 february 1996 in this version he stole a powerful solvent rather than a nuclear device and when the police shot at him the container was punctured the solvent severed every molecular bond on the left hand side of his body a brilliant surgeon rebuilt him as a cyborg and an ungrateful tharok then killed him tharok later upgrades his robot half giving it more built in weaponry post infinite crisis edit in the aftermath of the infinite crisis miniseries most of the legion s original continuity has been restored the restoration of the original continuity was confirmed in the lightning saga and the superman and the legion of super heroes story arcs tharok alongside the other fatal five members was among the supervillains in participating in a massive assault on the legion by superboy prime and the legion of super villains 15 thus it is unclear if tharok has encountered the dark man in current dc continuity or if the dark man even exists at all powers and abilities edit in the pre infinite crisis continuity the entire left hand side of tharok s body is mechanical it possesses great strength and durability and the arm can be configured into various weapon forms it also has a cybernetic brain that is connected to tharok s own giving him genius level intelligence in the current continuity tharok s upper body is wholly humanoid while below his waist he has a robotic carriage on wheels validus edit in the latter half of the 30th century an entity known as the sun eater threatened to consume earth s sun thus destroying the solar system 16 desperate to stop the sun eater s efforts superboy and the legion of super heroes recruited the aid of the fatal five they discovered that validus was among their ranks but had no idea of his true parental heritage the fatal five reluctantly agreed to help the legion and the sun eater s efforts were averted validus remained a loyal member of the fatal five always ready to do tharok s bidding 2 during one memorable altercation with the legion validus killed lyle norg the original invisible kid it was later revealed that validus origin supposedly stemmed from a diabolical plot by a powerful legion foe 17 as revenge for his defeat in the great darkness saga darkseid kidnapped one of the identical twin children of lightning lad and saturn girl at birth he then sent the newborn back in time cursed with a monstrous body and near mindlessness that made him easily controlled by the likes of the emerald empress with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other years later validus fell under darkseid s influence yet again he manipulated validus against lightning lad placing him in a situation where the legionnaire would be forced to kill him to save the life of his other son graym thanks to the efforts of saturn girl however the plot was averted and both parents discovered that validus was their child soon after validus reverted to his normal human condition his parents soon renamed him garridan during the five years later era chronicled in legion of super heroes vol 4 it was revealed that darkseid s tampering with garridan s body chemistry had spawned a new virus which brainiac 5 dubbed the validus plague only natives of winath and titan the homeworlds of garridan s parents were susceptible to the disease but for them it was fatal as a result garridan was forced to wear a containment suit allowing him mobility yet keeping him in perpetual medical quarantine his replacement in the reformed fatal five was a similar enigmatic behemoth named mordecai by leland mccauley iv after the events of the zero hour miniseries legion continuity was rebooted entirely and validus origin was changed considerably he was no longer the child of lightning lad and saturn girl darkseid had nothing to do with his creation and he was also significantly weaker in the threeboot continuity validus was the name of a nature spirit in the folklore of the planet of winath known as the lord of lightning mekt ranzz was a member of a cult that worshipped him since the ranzzes gained their powers and left the planet the cult has grown considerably seemingly granting everyone on winath lightning powers this was later revealed as the product of nanomachines in their blood the cover of justice league of america vol 2 13 depicts validus as a member of the latest incarnation of the injustice league however in the actual story contents of the same issue he does not appear alongside the other fatal five members validus was among the villains in superboy prime s legion of super villains 18 garridan ranzz along with his twin brother graym was recently depicted as a young child living with saturn girl and lightning lad 19 thus it appears that validus and garridan are not the same being in current continuity or that this validus is from a different moment in time powers and abilities edit the classic validus possessed tremendous superhuman strength enabling him to easily overpower even the silver age superboy in fact on one occasion it took the combined strength of kryptonian level heroes superboy mon el and ultra boy just to knock him down and on another superboy estimated that validus possessed 12 times his strength validus was shown to be strong enough to tear an entire planet apart with his bare hands in addition validus could fire energy bolts from his brain that were powerful enough to incapacitate a kryptonian or daxamite with a single hit he was extremely resistant to all forms of harm and sometimes seemed not even to notice super powered attacks against him by members of the legion he was able to fend off even the sun eater in order to rescue princess projectra showing that he was not innately evil he was also capable of flight through space and was immune to telepathy his first appearance did define some limitations to his power he could be held in a cell with thick inertron walls and it was believed that he could be executed with a bombardment of anti energy although that was not demonstrated depictions of validus strength and intelligence were not consistent over time toys edit in 2007 validus was released as part of the legion of superheroes happy meal toy set by mcdonald s validus was the collect and connect figure for the fifteenth wave of the dc universe classics line other versions edit a version of the fatal five appeared in tangent comics where the team is composed of the tangent comics versions of ice the shadow thief kid psycho deathstroke and count viper they next appear in a flashback in the tangent superman s reign miniseries 2008 in which they are shown to have slaughtered the second atom this version of the fatal five exist on earth 97 of the old multiverse which has been reborn as earth 9 of the new multiverse in other media edit the fatal five made their first television appearance in the justice league unlimited episode far from home with cara kesh version of emerald empress voiced by joanne whalley tharok by tomas arana persuader by an uncredited kin shriner and mano and validus having no dialogue the fatal five consisting of the original five members although both emerald empress and tharok act as leaders is

duplication self sustenance temporal and history manipulation doctor manhattan dr jonathan osterman often shortened to dr manhattan or simply manhattan is a fictional character who appears in comics published by dc comics he debuted in the graphic novel limited series watchmen doctor manhattan was created by writer alan moore and artist dave gibbons the watchmen series is noted for addressing metaphysical issues and questions doctor manhattan being the primary exponent he is often used as an example of a post human god the reception of the character is positive and he has appeared and been mentioned in various forms of media doctor manhattan later appeared in the before watchmen comic book prequel with his individual issue miniseries in 2016 as part of dc comics rebirth relaunch manhattan became a major character in the dc universe he was revealed to be responsible for the flashpoint event creating the new 52 timeline universe in the process a factor that removed 10 years of history of the dc characters 1 this led him to become one of the main characters in the doomsday clock miniseries published from 2017 to 2019 2 doctor manhattan made his first live action debut in the 2009 film watchmen played by billy crudup he also appeared in the 2019 limited television series watchmen played by yahya abdul mateen ii in his original form played by darrell snedeger contents 1

original proposal was surrounded by the shadow of nuclear threat however the writer found he could do more with manhattan as a supreme super hero than he ever could have with captain atom moore sought to delve into nuclear physics and quantum mechanics in constructing the character of dr manhattan the writer believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not perceive time from a linear perspective which would influence the character s perception of human affairs moore also wanted to avoid creating an emotionless character like spock from star trek so he sought for dr manhattan to retain human habits and to grow away from them and humanity in general gibbons had created the blue character rogue trooper and reused the blue skin motif for doctor manhattan as it resembles skin tonally but with a different hue moore incorporated color into the story and gibbons noted the rest of the comic s color scheme made manhattan unique 3 moore recalled that he was unsure if dc would allow the creators to depict the character as fully nude which partially influenced how they portrayed the character 4 gibbons wanted to tastefully depict manhattan s nudity selecting carefully when full frontal shots would occur and giving him understated genitals like a classical sculpture so the reader would not initially notice it 5 dr manhattan s forehead is marked with the atomic structure of hydrogen which he put on himself declining a helmet with the atom symbol fictional character biography edit origins edit jonathan osterman is born in 1929 to a german american family jon plans to follow in his father s footsteps as a watchmaker but when the u s drops the atomic bomb on hiroshima his father declares his profession outdated and instead forces him to work toward a career studying nuclear physics the incident represents the turning point in jon s potential future from watchmaker to nuclear physicist and foreshadows doctor manhattan s exterior perception of time as predetermined and all things within it as so determined including manhattan s own reactions and emotions jon attends princeton university and graduates with a ph d in atomic physics in early 1959 he moves to a research base at gila flats where experiments are being performed on the intrinsic fields of physical objects which if tampered with result in their disintegration here he meets janey slater a fellow researcher they eventually become lovers during a visit to an amusement park in new jersey janey s wristwatch is broken which jon promises to fix however one month later jon discovers he has left the repaired watch in his labcoat inside a test chamber while he is inside the test chamber the door closes and locks the researchers are unable to open the door or override the countdown and jon s body is torn to pieces from the force of the generator in the following months a series of strange events and apparitions occur at the research base leading residents to speculate that the area is haunted it becomes apparent that jon is progressively re forming himself during this time as indicated by a series of partial bodily reappearances first a disembodied nervous system including the brain and eyes then as a circulatory system and then as a partially muscled skeleton each time the appearance lasts for only a few seconds jon eventually fully reappears as a tall muscular hairless naked blue skinned man glowing with a flare of ultraviolet before watchmen edit jon gradually becomes a pawn of the u s government which gives him the code name doctor manhattan a reference to the manhattan project and a costume which he begrudgingly accepts doctor manhattan chooses as his emblem a representation of a hydrogen atom whose simplicity he declares to be something that kindles his respect accordingly he painlessly burns the mark into his forehead this preference for material mechanisms marks the beginning of his declining humanity which is progressively mirrored by his gradual shedding of the uniform by the end of the 1970s he refuses to wear anything at all except during mandatory public appearances however manhattan s presence tips the balance of the cold war in the west s favor and u s foreign policy becomes more militaristic as a result at president richard nixon s request he secures an american victory in the vietnam war one week after manhattan s direct involvement which subsequently allows nixon to repeal the 22nd amendment and serve up to five terms moreover far from solving the problems underlying international tensions manhattan s presence exacerbates them while stifling their expression which inevitably builds toward disaster the entire plot of watchmen occurs during the countdown to a potential nuclear war since he works for the u s government manhattan is exempt from a federal law outlawing costumed heroes but spends much of his time conducting research he is single handedly responsible for the shift to electric powered vehicles and adrian veidt credits him with causing a huge leap forward in a myriad of science and technology sectors as a result the technology of the alternative 1985 of the watchmen universe is far more advanced during the only meeting of the crimebusters group manhattan becomes attracted to laurie juspeczyk the second silk spectre his relationship with janey ends acrimoniously shortly after and he begins dating laurie events of watchmen edit at the start of watchmen manhattan works at the rockefeller military research center where he lives with laurie rorschach comes to inform the two of the murder of edward blake aka the comedian and warns them that all former costumed adventurers are being targeted by a mask killer manhattan dismisses rorschach by teleporting him outside and encourages laurie to go out with dan dreiberg the second nite owl shortly afterwards manhattan attends blake s funeral with veidt and dreiberg reflects on his association with blake during the vietnam war and senses the presence of the former villain moloch during an appearance on a talk show a reporter ambushes manhattan with allegations that he caused cancer in his former associates including janey seeking solitude he transports himself to mars the soviet union exploits his absence by invading afghanistan and sparking an international crisis eventually manhattan brings laurie to mars to discuss why he should aid humanity an argument laurie inadvertently wins when she realizes to her shock that her father is blake a man she despised for sexually assaulting her mother from this revelation manhattan is amazed by the improbable chances that occurred to result in the birth of laurie a chain of events he sees as a stunning thermodynamic miracle realizing that by extension this miracle can apply to any living thing on earth manhattan is persuaded to return to earth to protect humanity rather than disregarding it as insignificant veidt is found to have framed manhattan as part of his overall plot to avert world war iii by attacking new york with an engineered monster killing half of the city in the process although manhattan and laurie return too late to stop veidt they teleport to his base in antarctica to confront him veidt tries to disintegrate manhattan only for manhattan to restore himself more quickly than veidt expected however upon seeing that veidt s plan has averted war manhattan realizes that exposing him would be too dangerous for life on earth and agrees to stay silent rorschach leaves with the intention of exposing the truth causing manhattan to vaporize him manhattan decides to depart earth again suggesting that he desires to find a galaxy less complicated than this one when veidt asks if his plan worked out in the end manhattan replies in the end nothing ends adrian nothing ever ends in the dc universe edit the new 52 and dc rebirth edit after departing from the watchmen universe manhattan was aware of the dc universe being filled with hope inside humanity and traveled there to find a place among those people and start a new life but at some point his visions showed him an arms race among metahumans that caused an incoming world war iii leading manhattan to have a confrontation with superman and then he saw nothing 6 this revelation led manhattan to modify the dc universe s mainstream timeline to fix the fissures caused by the several crises across the multiverse unaware it was the doing of perpetua to free herself from the source wall however those actions would not get the expected result and would lead to the creation of the new 52 7 during the events of flashpoint manhattan deceived pandora into convincing barry allen to merge three separate timelines the dc universe the wildstorm universe and select vertigo titles in order to create prime earth 7 the merger enabled him to erase ten years from the reverted universe which not only reversed the age of its inhabitants by ten years but also caused the multiple resurrections of several deceased characters 8 in the new timeline manhattan prevents the last wizard of the council of eternity from revealing to pandora how to open the skull shaped box 9 and kills owlman and metron after the former tries to access the secrets of the universe 10 however the convergence caused by brainiac and telos restored the multiverse bringing back the pre flashpoint timeline 11 doctor manhattan used abra kadabra to trap wally west within the speed force and this modification in the timeline also caused the other speedsters jesse quick bart allen jay garrick and max mercury to be removed from history and trapped in the speed force however wally west was saved by barry therefore initiating the events of dc rebirth doctor manhattan then kills pandora after she finally realizes that he was the one responsible for all of the sins for which she had been blamed 8 barry and batman later began investigating the unknown force behind these changes 12 learning from lilith clay that manhattan was a prominent thought in kadabra s mind when he claimed responsibility for removing wally from history 13 eobard thawne attacks batman as he is studying a blood stained smiley face button left embedded within the wall of the batcave when thawne picks up the button he is briefly teleported away returning with the left half of his body charred to the bone just before his death he claims to have seen god 14 using the cosmic treadmill to chase after the radiation emitted from the button among the timestream batman and barry discover thawne as he was trying to reach god upon reaching the unseen figure thawne boosted his ability to exist as a paradox before he was vaporized by manhattan leaving only the button behind sometime later manhattan picks up the button as he recalls his dialogue with laurie 15 manhattan puts bruce wayne in contact with the flashpoint thomas wayne who tells his son not to become batman before his death and the destruction of the last of the flashpoint timeline 16 prompting bruce not to respond to the bat signal the following night manhattan also saves jor el from the destruction of krypton before conditioning him to see only the very worst of humanity 17 jor el assumes the identity of mister oz and tries to convince his son kal el or superman to abandon earth however when jor el begins to realize that he has been pushing against his son too far he is pulled away superman acknowledges jor el s warnings even as he rejects his misanthropy 18 all of which were to test the will and hope of the two major heroes of the dc universes during the events of heroes in crisis batman suspects that the massacre on sanctuary might be related to manhattan s actions 19 this theory was later proven to be partially true as wally gets in contact with metron s mobius chair which grants him part of manhattan s powers 20 events of doomsday clock edit during the events of doomsday clock seven years after the events set in the watchmen universe ozymandias adrian veidt is determined to find doctor manhattan to restore the world from chaos after his previous plan for world peace was exposed by rorschach s journal 21 veidt narrates that he is able to track doctor manhattan because doctor manhattan leaks electrons as his intrinsic field was stripped during his initial accident and an event caused by veidt using the owlship to quantum tunnel accompanied by rorschach ii marionette and mime veidt follows the electron trail left by doctor manhattan to the dc universe where they land in gotham city 22 later it is revealed that doctor manhattan is responsible for preventing the comedian s death by teleporting him to the dc universe 23 doctor manhattan recalls various events in which he indirectly killed alan scott and thus brought about changes in the timeline on july 16 1940 alan scott was riding on a train over a collapsing bridge but he survived by grabbing onto a green lantern he continues his life eventually sitting at a round table wearing a mask and later testifying before the house un american activities committee but refusing to implicate anyone in his employ on july 16 1940 again doctor manhattan moves the green lantern six inches out of his reach so that alan scott dies in the train accident and leaves no family behind as the green lantern is passed through different locations at a fun house in the present time bubastis ii begins glowing so ozymandias moves him closer to the lantern to let him feed on doctor manhattan s temporal energies left on the lantern and thereby force doctor manhattan to their current location doctor manhattan immediately proceeds to transport himself and the watchmen group away separating them from batman and joker he tells ozymandias that he isn t returning to their world as he s in the middle of something he reveals that he didn t kill marionette in the robbery years back because he saw what her child would do and that she is pregnant again he also reveals that ozymandias lied to rorschach about having cancer so ozymandias admits to rorschach that he deceived him and used him for his help doctor manhattan then tells everyone that he came to the dc universe looking for a place among them but that he saw a vision of the most hopeful among them heading toward him now hopeless and then nothing in the future thereafter doctor manhattan returns the team to the fun house he returns to mars reflecting on a vision set one month in his future a confrontation with superman that may result in superman destroying doctor manhattan or doctor manhattan destroying everything 24 on mars looking at a legion ring that once belonged to ferro lad doctor manhattan contemplates the events in which ferro lad sacrificed his life to save earth s sun and thereby caused his ring to careen through time the events in which he moved alan scott s lantern and thereby caused the ring never to have existed as well as his confrontation with superman set one week from then on earth batman and superman are recovering from a massive explosion which has produced a fog of tachyon particles that obscures the immediate past and future to doctor manhattan meanwhile after tracing the energy signature of the explosion to mars many of earth s superheroes travel in several spaceships to mars for a confrontation with the suspected perpetrator however batman believes that they are being played as he is unsure if they have the right person with the heroes surrounding doctor manhattan martian manhunter telepathically broadcasts doctor manhattan s final vision of superman to everyone the heroes believe that doctor manhattan is trying to destroy superman and all of them before superman destroys him as doctor manhattan easily deals with the attacks by the heroes he curiously examines and discloses the nature of the emotional spectrum by dissecting guy gardner s power ring and stating that the magic used by the justice league dark is from the scraps of creation to prove the point that even hope decays he shows ronnie raymond that professor martin stein purposely caused the circumstances where raymond and stein merged into firestorm to learn more about metahumans from the inside back on mars refusing to believe the events of the past that were shown firestorm attacks and harms doctor manhattan upon which the heroes realize that doctor manhattan is not invulnerable and destroy him however the superheroes watch in shock as doctor manhattan reconstitutes himself before he attacks and incapacitates them 25 as he incapacitates the remaining heroes doctor manhattan recounts the first time he arrived in the dc universe on april 18 1938 he meets carver colman as they talk in a diner doctor manhattan sees all moments of carver s future until his death prior to april 19 1955 overhearing news of a mysterious man who lifted a car over his head doctor manhattan leaves and witnesses the first appearance of the golden age superman from there he witnesses the beginnings of alan scott green lantern jay garrick the flash hawkman atom doctor fate sandman spectre and hourman and the formation of the justice society of america doctor manhattan then sees a different timeline where superman was never a member of the jsa and first appeared in 1956 instead silver age earth 1 doctor manhattan witnesses several variations of the death of superman s foster parents jonathan and martha kent the origins of superman and also when a young superboy met the legion of super heroes to appease his curiosity doctor manhattan moves the green lantern away from alan scott preventing the creation of the green lantern and the formation of the jsa to see how the changes affect superman in doing this doctor manhattan realizes that this universe is not part of the multiverse but is the metaverse with the multiverse reacting to the changes within this universe hence why there have been endless parallel worlds none at all 52 universes and a dark multiverse having changed history in the metaverse doctor manhattan created the new 52 universe and as he witnesses the first appearance of the new 52 superman he is confronted by wally west of the pre flashpoint universe who briefly escapes the speed force to warn him that he knows what doctor manhattan did and that the heroes of the dc universe will stop him before being dragged back into the speed force doctor manhattan likens wally s appearance to the metaverse fighting back at the changes done to it an innate hope that fights back to the surface he returns to carver colman on june 8 1954 10 seconds before he is killed by his mother and he thinks upon the future he sees where superman attacks him believing that he will either die by superman s hands or destroy the metaverse back to present day doctor manhattan returns to earth and ponders that he is a being of inaction on a collision course with a man of action superman and to this universe of hope he has become the villain 26 after arriving on earth manhattan meets superman in person during black adam s invasion on the white house with ozymandias watching 27 manhattan witnesses superman s fight with black adam and russia s superhero team called the people s heroes he eventually reveals to superman that he is the one who has been tampering with reality and that he also caused the death of jonathan and martha kent manhattan expects superman to attack him but superman instead protects him from pozhar and then tells him that he should use his powers for good manhattan is inspired by superman s heroism and his pivotal role in the fabric of reality he undoes part of his actions restoring much of the pre new 52 timeline many characters are brought back into existence including superman s parents manhattan also goes back in time and changes carver colman s future for the better he then goes back to the watchmen universe bringing rorschach and ozymandias with him manhattan saves his earth by making all nuclear weapons disappear afterwards he takes mime and marionette s infant son with him and proceeds to raise him on his own so he will become their planet s equivalent to superman his final thought wanders to what his life could have been if he had not become doctor manhattan janey convinces him to not retrieve the watch so he is not involved in the incident that would have given him his powers he marries janey and they start a family together having two daughters and a son living a life without any worry of time he smiles one last time believing it to be a nice daydream to live in doctor manhattan then erases himself from existence transferring his lifeforce to the planet and his powers to mime and marionette s son he leaves the boy whom he has named clark to be adopted by the former nite owl and silk spectre 28 after doomsday clock edit this article may require copy editing for grammar style cohesion tone or spelling you can assist by editing it october 2022 learn how and when to remove this template message during the events of dark nights death metal wally west reveals doctor manhattan s energy is connective energy and after he restored the dc universe 28 the quintessence s members used that same energy against perpetua the batman who laughs has wally prisoner to get manhattan s powers but wonder woman suggests to use both the connective and crisis energies to create an anti crisis the event also features the final bruce wayne an amalgamated version of batman and doctor manhattan created when an alternate batman tried to track manhattan and ended up recreating the accident that gave jon his powers the batman who laughs was able to capture this alternate and extract his brain before he could properly harness his powers allowing the batman who laughs to transplant himself into the body transforming the villain into the darkest knight with the goal of creating a multiverse consisting of chaos 29 characterization edit appearance edit doctor manhattan s body is humanoid and his build tall and muscular his height and relative size vary depending on his needs but generally remains above 1 83 m 6 0 ft tall he is completely blue altering his shade and luminosity at will and has no hair on his forehead he has etched a stylized image of a hydrogen atom he did this during preparations by the military for his unveiling to the general public they presented him with a hat as a part of his uniform that had a group of crossed ellipses on it intended to look like an atom but jon did not see the resemblance he replaced it with a symbol of his own saying that if he were to have a symbol it should at least be one that he respects as doctor manhattan his costume started out as a black leotard which presumably he created as time progressed the costume shrank progressively to a pair of shorts then a brief then a thong he eventually went on to wear nothing at all since he had become indifferent to the need for clothing the only purpose his original costume served was to make those around him including the general public more comfortable before the experiment jon osterman was a human of average height he had brown hair and brown eyes as a physicist he often wore a suit personality edit dr manhattan though supremely powerful suffers from a decreasing ability to relate to normal humans perhaps due to his perception of time and realisation of the deterministic universe he begins to show symptoms of apathy from his radically altered perspective almost all human concerns appear pointless and without obvious merit he describes laurie as his only remaining link to humanity this is demonstrated when the relationship ends and doctor manhattan leaves earth this is also due to evidence coming to light that a number of those who were once close to him including his former girlfriend janey slater have come down with terminal cancer manhattan feels that he poses a threat to others and he exiles himself to mars stating i am tired of earth these people i m tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives his interest in humanity is revived after he witnesses laurie s epiphany that she is the daughter of the comedian it causes him to reflect on the sheer chance that life should come to be in any form but after the watchmen fail to prevent ozymandias s destruction of new york he departs earth commenting that he may explore new life in other parts of the galaxy in dc rebirth 1 pandora accuses her killer currently thought to be doctor manhattan of believing in skepticism doubt and corruption proclaiming that he cannot understand the hope personified in the heroes of the dc universe and that they will prove him wrong his meddling with the dc universe to satisfy his own curiosity shows extreme apathy he s altered the timeline so much that several events and people were altered or wiped out however thanks to the convergence wally west and superman much of the damage was undone though manhattan wasn t deterred from continuing his experiment he erased the golden age by preventing alan scott from getting his powers and helping form the jsa no jsa to inspire clark to be superboy meant no legion existed either he remained indifferent to a survivor who avoided erasure in the last watchmen issue manhattan claimed that nothing ends despite ozymandias succeeding in his plan for world peace but in doomsday clock manhattan withdrew from what he previously said after witnessing the dc universe s citizens losing their own faith in their heroes now affirming that everything ends his sole interest was in the moment superman was to punch at him a moment he couldn t see past in irony manhattan was the antithesis of superman being a human who had lost all senses of humanity while superman was an alien who embodied the best of humanity when the foretold moment came manhattan revealed he was responsible for erasing superman s loved ones however he was shocked that the punch was meant to knock away a villain behind him superman sought only to help and be better which manhattan saw as the answer the entire dc multiverse created new worlds for superman to be born in every era until the 31st century where his ideals brought peace after resorting the jsa and legion manhattan decided his world and multiverse could use someone like superman but manhattan himself was too detached from his humanity so he would need to raise a child and impart his powers to him to this end he raises clark maez mime and marionette s son before leaving him to be adopted by his former teammates powers and abilities edit jon is the only character in watchmen to possess superpowers throughout watchmen he is shown to be absolutely powerful and invulnerable to all harm even when his body is disintegrated he can reconstruct it in a matter of seconds and remains unharmed he is capable of altering his size depending on his needs for example reconstructing himself in a much bigger form he can hurl huge objects effortlessly with his hands he is also unable to exhaust himself jon has complete awareness of and control over atomic and subatomic particles he is also an omnikinetic he does not need air water food or sleep and is immortal he can teleport himself and others over limitless distances he is also capable of true flight although he uses only levitation in most of his appearances due to his perception of time he sees his past present and future simultaneously jon is able to phase any part of his body through solid objects without damaging them produce multiple copies of himself which function independently of each other project destructive energy disintegrate people create force fields transmute create and destroy matter move objects without physically touching them telekinesis reverse entropy repair anything no matter how damaged and he suggests create life he also claims to have walked on the surface of the sun at one point it is stated that in the event of a nuclear war he would be capable of destroying soviet nuclear missiles while at the same time destroying large areas of russia as a result of these capabilities jon becomes central to the united states cold war strategy of deterrence he is also capable of manipulating reality as he sees fit through the use of time manipulation as seen when he erased ten years from the dc universe when barry allen tried to bring his original universe back to normal jon s intervention caused the new 52 timeline to be formed within which most superheroes are younger and less experienced and most of them lose their most important relationships before they begin however despite his immense power he was unable to erase or permanently kill eobard thawne the reverse flash in the dc universe manhattan s power is revealed to be connective energy the opposite to crisis energy scientific accuracy edit in the 2009 film adaptation watchmen physics professor james kakalios of the university of minnesota was used as a scientific consultant and shed light on the potential scientific explanations of doctor manhattan s powers both in the film and the comic cherenkov radiation inspired doctor manhattan s appearance in the 2009 film adaptation kakalios explained that the intrinsic field has basis in reality in that it is a representation of a collection of the electromagnetic and strong and weak nuclear forces kakalios explained that if a being were able to manipulate matter such a being would have complete control over these three forces hence the intrinsic field would exist kakalios also explained that while it is unlikely doctor manhattan s teleportation abilities seemingly could be achieved through quantum tunnelling should doctor manhattan have control over his probability wave functions philosophical implications edit the character of doctor manhattan is one that invokes thought on the philosophy of metaphysics there are various themes addressed throughout the watchmen series from philosophy of time and eternalism to determinism and its relationship to ethics to addressing questions such as what does it mean to be human and do the ends justify the means the character is primarily cited as the representation of the potential side effects and dangers of a superintelligence which include detachment from the rest of humanity and potentially characteristics of apathy 30 in other media edit television edit doctor manhattan appears in watchmen motion comic where he along with every other character in the series is voiced by tom

end is nigh voiced by crispin freeman 32 references in other works edit in final crisis 2 the exiled monitor nix uotan sketches a character resembling doctor manhattan grant morrison stated in an interview that the final crisis two part series superman beyond will feature captain atom from earth 4 which is kind of a weird amalgam of the original charlton universe and this kind of watchmen parallel world 33 this character is named captain adam and appears in superman beyond 1 he is blue skinned and has the hydrogen atom mark of doctor manhattan and is addicted to drugs which keep his quantum senses in check when he is off the drugs he becomes very similar to doctor manhattan in demeanor and powers duplicating himself hundreds of times over to repair the bleed starship and allow the various supermen to pilot the thought robot armor which itself is confirmed to grant one powers capable of beating captain adam however even when he is using his full potential without the aid of

typhoon disambiguation for other areas in which tropical cyclones occur see tropical cyclone basins not to be confused with typhoo satellite image of a typhoon typhoon goni three different tropical cyclones active over the western pacific ocean on august 7 2006 maria bopha and saomai the cyclones on the lower and upper right are typhoons a typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180 and 100 e in the northern hemisphere this region is referred to as the northwestern pacific basin 1 and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on earth accounting for almost one third of the world s annual tropical cyclones for organizational purposes the northern pacific ocean is divided into three regions the eastern north america to 140 w central 140 w to 180 and western 180 to 100 e the regional specialized meteorological center rsmc for tropical cyclone forecasts is in japan with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest pacific in hawaii the joint typhoon warning center the philippines and hong kong although the rsmc names each system the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year 2 within most of the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are several main requirements for typhoon formation and development 1 sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures 2 atmospheric instability 3 high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere 4 enough coriolis effect to develop a low pressure center 5 a pre existing low level focus or disturbance and 6 a low vertical wind shear although the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms may occur between december and may although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of japan the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with china and japan being less often impacted however some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck china southern china has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region with a thousand year sample via documents within their archives taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest pacific tropical cyclone basins however vietnam recognises its typhoon season as lasting from the beginning of june through to the end of november with an average of four to six typhoons hitting the country annually 3 4 contents 1 nomenclature 1 1 etymology and usage 1 2 intensity

the term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest pacific for a severe or mature tropical cyclone 5 whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic 6 elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic storm 7 the french typhon has been attested with the meaning of whirlwind or storm since 1504 8 the oxford english dictionary 9 cites hindustani ṭūfān and chinese tai fung giving rise to several early forms in english the earliest forms in english touffon later tufan tuffon and others derive from hindustani ṭūfān with citations as early as 1588 from 1699 appears tuffoon later tiffoon derived from chinese with spelling influenced by the older hindustani derived forms the modern spelling typhoon dates to 1820 preceded by tay fun in 1771 and ty foong all derived from the chinese tai fung the hindustani source word ṭūfān violent storm perso arabic طوفان devanagari त फ न 10 comes from the persian tūfān توفان طوفان meaning storm which comes from the verb tūfīdan توفیدن طوفیدن to roar to blow furiously citation needed the word طوفان ṭūfān is also derived from arabic as coming from ṭāfa to turn round 9 the chinese source is the word tai fung or taifeng 10 simplified chinese 台风 traditional chinese 颱風 pinyin táifēng the modern japanese word 台風 たいふう taifuu as well as the modern korean word 태풍 taepung are also derived from chinese the first character is normally used to mean pedestal or stand but is actually a simplification of the older chinese character 颱 which means typhoon thus the word originally meant typhoon wind in vietnamese 大 風 đại phong translates literally to strong winds but the phrase bão nhiệt đới 暴熱帶 ferocious tropical storm is used instead the ancient greek τυφῶν typhôn typhon is related and has secondarily influenced the word 10 the persian term may originally have been influenced by the greek word 9 11 intensity classifications edit see also tropical cyclone scales rsmc tokyo s tropical cyclone intensity scale category sustained winds violent typhoon 105 knots 194 km h very strong typhoon 85 104 knots157 193 km h typhoon 64 84 knots118 156 km h severe tropical storm 48 63 knots89 117 km h tropical storm 34 47 knots62 88 km h tropical depression 33 knots 61 km h a tropical depression is the lowest category that the japan meteorological agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots 38 mph 61 km h 12 a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots 39 mph 63 km h tropical storms also receive official names from rsmc tokyo 12 should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots 55 mph 89 km h then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm 12 once the system s maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots 74 mph 119 km h the jma will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon the highest category on its scale 12 since 2009 the hong kong observatory has divided typhoons into three different classifications typhoon severe typhoon and super typhoon 13 a typhoon has wind speed of 64 79 knots 73 91 mph 118 149 km h a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots 92 mph 150 km h and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots 120 mph 190 km h 13 the united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130 knots 67 m s 150 mph 241 km h the equivalent of a strong category 4 storm in the saffir simpson scale as super typhoons 14 however the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the jtwc uses are based on a 1 minute averaging period akin to the u s s national hurricane center and central pacific hurricane center as a result the jtwc s wind reports are higher than jma s measurements as the latter is based on a 10 minute averaging interval 15 genesis edit depth of 26 c isotherm on october 1 2006 see also tropical cyclogenesis there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form normally an ocean temperature of 26 5 c 79 7 f spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres 160 ft is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems a minimum distance of 500 km 300 mi from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis 16 whether it be a depression in the intertropical convergence zone itcz or monsoon trough a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis about 85 to 90 percent of pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough 17 even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low vertical wind shear of less than 10 m s 20 kn 33 ft s between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development 16 typically with pacific typhoons there are two outflow jets one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the westerlies and a second towards the equator 17 in general the westerly wind increases associated with the madden julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere s summer season 18 on average twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western pacific ocean near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south along the same meridian or line of longitude 19 there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the madden julian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time 20 frequency edit storm frequencytropical storms and typhoons by month

round with peak months from august to october the peak months correspond to that of the atlantic hurricane seasons along with a high storm frequency this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record one of the most recent busy seasons was 2013 tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest pacific ocean and concentrate around june and november in the northern indian ocean the area just northeast of the philippines is the most active place on earth for tropical cyclones to exist across the philippines themselves activity reaches a minimum in february before increasing steadily through june and spiking from july through october with september being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago activity falls off significantly in november although typhoon haiyan the strongest philippine typhoon on record was a november typhoon 23 the most frequently impacted areas of the philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central luzon and eastern visayas 24 a ten year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones 25 the genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near 10 year frequency 26 paths edit see also hurricane alley tracks of all tropical cyclones in the northernwestern pacific ocean between 1980 and 2005 the vertical line to the right is the international date line most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move

planet s most powerful tropical cyclones most frequently develop 28 when the subtropical ridge shifts due to el niño so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience many fewer september november tropical cyclone impacts during el niño and neutral years during el niño years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130 e which would favor the japanese archipelago 29 during la niña years the formation of tropical cyclones and the subtropical ridge position shift westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and greater intensity to philippines 29 those that form near the marshall islands find their way to jeju island korea 30 typhoon paths follow three general directions 22 straight track or straight runner a general westward path affects the philippines southern china taiwan and vietnam a parabolic recurving track storms recurving affect the eastern philippines eastern china taiwan korea japan and the russian far east northward track from point of origin the storm follows a northerly direction only affecting small islands a rare few storms like hurricane john were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the eastern central pacific and moved into the western pacific basin monitoring edit within the western pacific rsmc tokyo typhoon center part of the japan meteorological agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 1989 31 and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000 13 however each national meteorological and hydrological service within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies 32 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa for interests in the island archipelago nation 33 and the hong kong observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals 34 name sources and name list edit the list of names consists of entries from 14 southeast and east asian nations and regions and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into a list the names on the list will be used from up to down from left to right when all names on the list are used it will start again from the left top corner when a typhoon causes damage in a region the affected region can request for retiring the name in the next session of the escap wmo typhoon committee a new name will be decided by the region whose name was retired unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however philippines pagasa retains its own naming list which consists of both human names and other things 35 storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon list of western pacific tropical

references 7 external links pre zero hour edit universo first appeared as a powerful hypnotist 2 with his hypno stone he is able to control the head of the time institute and lure the legionnaires into a series of traps 3 the legion defeats him with the help of a time cube invented by scientist rond vidar who is subsequently revealed to be universo s son with his next scheme universo manages to take control of earth by posing as the new president kandro boltax using his powers of hypnosis augmented by a chemical placed in the world s water supply he accomplishes this while most of the legion is away from earth on a mission and they return to find the legion outlawed the legion find refuge in one of lex luthor s abandoned hideouts and eventually with the help of rond vidar are able to thwart his plans 4 years later legionnaires blok and timber wolf view a file from the legion archives therein it is revealed that universo is a former member of the green lantern corps who was assigned to journey to the time institute on earth and prevent the legion from viewing the dawn of time an act which had catastrophic consequences when perpetrated eons earlier by the maltusian scientist krona when he attempted to view the dawn of time himself he was stripped of his ring by the guardians of the universe making him and sinestro the only two renegade green lanterns in pre crisis continuity 5 rond vidar would later acquire his power ring 6 subsequently universo manages to temporarily take control of earth again this time posing as president mojai desai s right hand man vid gupta as depicted in the universo project the villain succeeds in mentally controlling the entire legion except the four members most difficult to hypnotize saturn girl brainiac 5 chameleon boy and dream girl he strands the quartet on a distant world but the four manage to make their way back to earth and defeat universo once again 7 five years later edit years later the dominators seize control of earth during its economic collapse and universo ends up as one of the primary leaders of the resistance movement he is branded a terrorist by the dominion backed earthgov who accuse him of working with the khunds he was in fact working with the dark circle though it is clear he is not working for them and has his own agenda jacques foccart troy stewart and the former members of the legion of substitute heroes work alongside him in resisting the dominion control of earth after earth is liberated he uses his new status to work further schemes with leland mccauley iv post zero hour edit following the rebooting of legion history in zero hour universo was reinvented as sarmon ardeen saturn girl s cousin he first appears in the legion titans crossover universe ablaze march 2000 set in an alternate timeline in which the titans are in suspended animation until the 31st century he joins forces with a recreated cult of blood to take control of the titans when this timeline is negated the real timeline has him imprisoned on his home moon titan after the return of the legion lost from the second galaxy universo makes an attempt to control saturn girl and the titanet telepathic communication network this fails and saturn girl leaves his mind in the same fantasy scenario he had created for her this version of universo has been erased from continuity in the aftermath of the infinite crisis miniseries post infinite crisis edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis on infinite earths legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the action comics story arc superman and the legion of super heroes universo is among the super villains in superboy prime s legion of super villains as seen in the subsequent final crisis legion of 3 worlds miniseries therein he gives his assent and approval as superboy prime murders his son rond falsely believing that he would be able to seize rond s green lantern power ring upon his death 8 the new 52 edit in the new 52 universo disguises himself as the new president elect of earth hiroshi takaneda after a precognitive terrorist attempts an assassination he hypnotizes saturn girl into missing his true identity it is revealed that within 9 years the united planets will fall apart under the villain s tyrannic rule 9 other versions edit universo appears in the one shot batman 66 meets the legion of super heroes he is depicted as the descendant of the batman tv series villain egghead and teams up with his ancestor to battle both batman and robin and the legionnaires both of the villains are defeated and apprehended at the end of the story powers and abilities edit universo s primary power is that of hypnosis allowing him to control people in a manner that lasts long after he leaves them he is able to shift loyalties erase memories and even have people under his control think independently to a degree to accomplish the goals he sets them to he sometimes wears a necklace which seems to enhance the power of his hypnosis using his mental abilities he can also appear to be someone else so that everyone viewing him sees and remembers him as a completely different person at one point he possessed a green lantern power ring but it was stripped from him as such he had a particular grudge against oa the planet of the guardians of the universe and he had planned in the universo project to use the legion to attack oa references edit

massively multiplayer online role playing game that was developed by carbine studios published by ncsoft it was unveiled on august 17 2011 during gamescom 2 wildstar took place on the fictional planet nexus where a mysterious and powerful race known as the eldan have disappeared leaving behind a wealth of technology and secrets for players to explore 3 4 the game was released on june 3 2014 with a subscription and later changed to free to play on september 29 2015 while it was no longer required to pay for a subscription those who did were signature members getting a few bonuses such as increased experience currency gain on september 6 2018 ncsoft announced the immediate closure of carbine studios and that wildstar would begin the process of winding down an exact shut down date was

development 3 1 audio 4 reception 5 references 6 external links plot edit setting edit the eldan a highly advanced alien race sought to create a perfect being called the genesis prime through the nexus project this being whom the eldan named drusera seemed kind and benevolent and was capable of shaping reality as she saw fit shortly thereafter the eldan realized that their creation was less than perfect drusera contained an alternate malicious personality which they called the entity they attempted to destroy the entity using a device called the primal disintegrator however they were unsuccessful and in retaliation the entity annihilated all eldan on the planet nexus distraught over her failure to save the eldan drusera then imprisoned herself and by extension the entity before their sudden extinction the eldan had sown the seeds for an intergalactic empire they had contacted humans inhabiting a planet called cassus and assisted them in forming a mighty civilization which would span galaxies and ultimately be under eldan control 7 after their patrons disappearance the majority of the cassian humans continued as they had done before forming a religion around the vanished eldan a splinter faction who would become known as the exiles rebelled against the nascent dominion and fled into the stars over the years they accumulated other races who had grievances with the cassian dominion 8 shortly before the beginning of the game an exile explorer rediscovers nexus both factions attempt to lay claim to the world the exiles want a planet to settle and call home while the dominion see the world as sacred and consider it a holy obligation to take it for themselves unfortunately for both sides nexus still contains drusera the entity and many holdovers from the nexus project both mechanical and living the factions wrestling for control of the eldan world need to fight not only each other but the world itself gameplay edit in wildstar players were able to create a character that they could control through their playing session these characters could move in an open persistent world environment 9 characters could level from 1 to 50 10 gameplay mainly consisted of quests dungeons and player versus player combat movement edit wildstar allowed the player many liberties in movement such as double jumping sprinting and dashing this tied into the gameplay in ways such as speed races and jumping puzzles 11 12 moreover there were zones with altered gravity in the game allowing the player to jump higher 13 combat edit a player confronts a boss in a party of 5 people both the player and the boss have their health points displayed on the center left and center right of the image respectively wildstar used a system of telegraphs for combat where zones are displayed on the ground allowing a player to predict attacks of enemies and heals of allies a player could dodge them by either walking or dashing out of them 14 15 player attacks were also telegraphs this means that players had to cast them in the right direction if they wanted to damage enemies players also had the option of auto targeting enemies which puts the telegraph for the move they use centered on their current target this made it easier to get a particular enemy into their telegraph but often wouldn t catch as many enemies as a well placed free targeting attack would 14 housing edit in wildstar players could own a sky plot this plot was a part of land consisting of a house and several sockets each socket could receive different plugs plugs could consist of many different things such as a crafting bench a mine an exploration shaft etc 16 17 the exterior offered not only plugs but a remodel feature to change the ground sky and background music as well as complete creative freedom with decor decor could be placed anywhere rescaled in size and rotated three different ways each housing plot had the option to put down one of many houses at the center of the exterior which could be entered for a house interior that could have its walls floors ceiling and lighting modified through remodeling as well as free decor placement such as on the exterior various interior decorations offer a bonus to rested experience if a player logged out inside their home making a house the best source of rested experience in the game this plot could be accessed by anyone who has the owner s permission every plug could be used by all the players who have access to this plot if a visitor performed a task such as harvesting the reward can be split by the visitor and the owner of the plot allowing friends to maintain a plot for the owner and allowing both to benefit while housing was not a required part of the game it offered many advantages to the players from personal workbenches gathering nodes personal dungeons quicker access to raids and increased rested experience near the game s sunset housing communities were added allowing up to five housing plots belonging to different characters to be combined with some space between each individual skyplot to freely decorate with the housing decor character advancement edit upon character creation players would be able to choose among six classes four paths and eight races classes were limited to certain pre determined races there were no inherent statistical or game play differences in the different races the difference was all aesthetic 18 each class was able to fulfill the role of dps as well as one of the support roles tank or healer 19 wildstar also used a system of paths upon character creation players were able to choose among the four paths in addition to their desired class unlike classes paths were not restricted to specific races and leveled up independently of class capping at 30 the paths were loosely based on the bartle player types 20 the path the player chose upon character creation determined what kind of extra content the player enjoys and each path gave players unique bonuses and benefits 21 player versus player edit wildstar offered numerous means of player conflict wildstar allowed players of opposing factions to fight almost anywhere within the in game world 22 in addition to open world combat players were able to participate in more organized combat such as arenas battlegrounds or war plots where players fought each other in teams 23 arenas consisted of small teams 2v2 3v3 or 5v5 attempting to kill the opposing group of enemies each team had a set amount of respawns a match was won when all of the members of a certain team had been killed and were unable to respawn 24 battlegrounds consisted of larger teams 10v10 to 15v15 matches were centered on varying objectives and victory conditions were dependent upon the nature of the objectives teams are tasked with 25 war plots have the biggest teams 30v30 a war plot is a fortress controlled by a war party players of a war party had to build the war plot in order to increase its attack and defense possibilities matches were then organized by two war parties victory is then obtained when players take control of the opposing team s war plot 26 raiding edit one of the main attractions of wildstar was its unique style of player vs environment encounters or raids carbine studios took a stance unlike other games at the time and marketed raid encounters as hardcore 27 two primary raid instances were available in both 20 player and 40 player formats the game began with the 20 man genetic archives 28 instance and players progressed towards the 40 player datascape instance a future patch would lower the player number required in this instance to 20 29 the encounters were unique in that they were built primarily off of wildstar s telegraph combat system meaning players would need to interact with bosses in unfamiliar ways to defeat them development edit wildstar development started in 2005 after 17 former members of blizzard entertainment founded carbine studios at the time they had a desire to do anything but wow 30 in fact most were excited and overjoyed to try and start over this time not making the same mistakes that might have been made before when confronted with the decision of a game engine the company first looked at off the shelf options although multiple engines were available for use the team found that none of them suited their needs to be able to scale well five years into the future eventually the team decided it would be best for them to create their own allowing them complete freedom 31 in 2007 ncsoft acquired carbine studios saying they were working on an unannounced mmo project 32 wildstar was first announced by ncsoft at gamescom 2011 and that it would use the subscription model 2 two weeks later more footage of the game was released at pax prime 2011 33 wildstar initially gave players two methods of paying for the game s subscription a monthly fee or the purchase of an in game item c r e d d with real money c r e d d granted 30 days of playtime and is tradable to other players for in game currency 34 this essentially enables the player driven economy to set the in game price for c r e d d and thus an exchange rate between real money and in game currency on may 28 2015 ncsoft announced that the game would become free to play to all players starting on september 29 2015 35 coinciding with the launch of the free to play model the game received graphical updates that improves the lighting system skyboxes and viewing distance 36 in february 2016 ncsoft closed the game s pvp servers for being under populated and those users were merged with the two remaining pve servers 37 the decision to close down carbine studios and shutdown the wildstar game servers was announced by ncsoft at a staff meeting on september 6 2018 after at least two other projects were declined by the publisher ncsoft promised to refund in game purchases made after july 1 2018 5 wildstar s servers were announced to go

active battle system and numerous side features such as housing and challenges ign s branden tyrrel remarked that wildstar is of course not the next evolution of the modern mmorpg instead it s much more the culmination of a decade s worth of experimentation and design cherry picked and enhanced and infused with carbine s twists and light hearted flourish 41 gamesradar praised the game s combat system and its side features but panned the game s traditional questing as patience breakingly long and its story telling as shallow 40 references edit wildstar the engine interview zam zam april 22

antagonist of the lion the witch and the wardrobe 1950 and the magician s nephew 1955 in c s lewis s series the chronicles of narnia she is commonly referred to as the white witch in the lion the witch and the wardrobe as she is the witch who froze narnia in the hundred years winter some recent editions of the books include brief notes added by later editors that describe the cast of characters as lewis scholar peter schakel points out the notes description of jadis and the queen of underland the main antagonist of the silver chair states incorrectly that the queen of underland is an embodiment of jadis 1 beyond characterising the two as northern witches lewis s text does not connect them see lady of the green kirtle for further discussion contents 1 character history 1 1 the

she is identified by a character as a descendant of giants and adam s first wife lilith she d like us to believe that she is a human and it s on that that she bases her claim to be queen but she s no daughter of eve she comes of your father adam s first wife her they called lilith and she was one of the jinn that s what she comes from on one side and on the other she comes of the giants no no there isn t a drop of real human blood in the witch 8 35 this reference to lilith is a tribute to the fantasy novel with this title by george macdonald a literary hero of c s lewis citation needed jadis died in battle in narnian year 1000 meaning that she lived for well over 1 000 years the magician s nephew edit in the magician s nephew jadis is introduced as the last queen of charn a city in an entirely different world from narnia she was the last of a long line of kings and queens who were good in the beginning but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of charn ruling it as despots jadis a powerful sorceress fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister on the point of defeat jadis chose not to submit but instead spoke the deplorable word a powerful spell which destroyed all life on charn except her own she then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from charn many years later a 12 year old digory kirke and his friend polly plummer arrive in the ruins of charn through digory s uncle s magic the children find the bell that jadis left to break the spell despite polly s warning not to ring the bell digory does so jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to london in the year 1900 she initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported but finds that her magic does not work there digory seeking to correct his mistake attempts to transport her back to charn but they end up instead in the world of narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion aslan as aslan approaches she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn from a london lamp post with her great physical strength when this has no effect she flees jadis makes her way to the garden on a mountain west of narnia where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life however this supposed immortality comes at a cost her skin is bleached white and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery she cannot stand the sight of the tree that aslan has digory plant in narnia from the fruit of the garden and she thus stays to the north of narnia working to develop her magic meanwhile the land of narnia remains the domain of animals chosen animals are given the ability to speak and become pillars of society and is not troubled by the witch nor any other enemy for many hundreds of years the lion the witch and the wardrobe edit in the lion the witch and the wardrobe set 1 000 narnian years after the events of the magician s nephew the tree that kept jadis at bay has died and jadis has usurped power over narnia she is now known as the white witch and is served by various races including wolves who make up her secret police black dwarves giants werewolves tree spirits that are on her side ghouls boggles ogres minotaurs cruels hags spectres people of the toadstools incubi wraiths horrors efreets orknies sprites wooses ettins poisonous plant spirits evil apes giant bats vultures and creatures that as lewis writes are so horrible that if i told you your parents probably wouldn t let you read this book the witch s magic is now powerful and with her wand she can turn enemies to stone many good narnians who have objected to her rule have ended up being captured by the witch and her forces and turned into stone in the courtyard or the interior of her castle which stands isolated between two hills in the north of narnia stories of this grim fate has spread around narnia from the few narnians who were lucky enough to be taken in there and who were released or managed to escape she styles herself her imperial majesty jadis queen of narnia chatelaine of cair paravel empress of the lone islands and she casts narnia into an endless winter with no christmas she fears a prophecy that four humans two sons of adam and two daughters of eve will bring about the end of her reign and ultimately her life and orders all narnians to bring any human they come across to her by the time the pevensie children arrive in narnia jadis has ruled for 100 years although a mere 40 years have passed on earth the children were staying as wartime evacuees at the country home of digory kirke now an ageing professor she first meets edmund pevensie while riding on her sledge through the land of narnia enchants him with magical turkish delight and tempts him to betray his siblings by offering to make him her heir she wants all four of them although at this stage only edmund and his sister lucy have been in narnia the four pevensie children arrive together in narnia soon afterwards and edmund strays to the witch after he and the other children are taken in by mr and mrs beaver while he understands now that the queen of narnia as she had introduced herself and the white witch are one and the same he is still determined to taste more turkish delight and remains convinced that the witch would keep her promise to make him heir to her throne in the meantime her secret police had captured tumnus the faun who had harboured lucy on her first visit to narnia after discovering that he had disobeyed the witch s orders to hand over any humans to her but with the approach of aslan her magical winter thaws edmund receives a hostile reception from the white witch upon arriving at her castle without his siblings who is even angrier when he informs her that aslan has arrived in narnia the harshness of the witch s winter makes edmund realise that he has been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side and he realises the full extent of her evil when he witnesses her angrily turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that father christmas had been in narnia a wolf eventually reaches jadis and informs her that edmund s siblings have reached aslan s camp and that one of them killed maugrim jadis sends the wolf off to rally her army as speedily as they can as she prepares to kill edmund as a traitor aslan s army advances to rescue edmund as jadis uses a spell to conceal herself and her dwarf jadis then arrives at the stone table and meets aslan for a parley and insists on her right as the first to rebel against aslan to take the life of edmund as a traitor she accepts aslan s offer of his own life as substitute knowing that without him the pevensies cannot stand against her aslan keeps this pact secret from his followers jadis has aslan bound at the stone table and an ogre shaves his mane she tells him that his sacrifice won t save edmund and that he has given her narnia forever then she kills him with a stone knife susan and lucy who followed aslan from their encampment witness his death from bushes nearby jadis is unaware however of a deeper magic from before narnia s founding as a willing innocent victim who has offered his life in a traitor s stead aslan is revived he then heads to her castle and restores all her statues to life he brings them as reinforcements to the battle at beruna against the witch s army who are already battling against aslan s followers her army is defeated and aslan himself kills jadis most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army who do not surrender flee and are later killed by aslan s followers references and comparisons in other narnia books edit in prince caspian 1 300 years after the witch s death narnia has been conquered by the telmarines a human race who believe they have wiped out narnia s population of mythical beings and talking animals the old narnians however are still very much alive and have been driven into hiding and they rebel under the leadership of the disinherited telmarine heir prince caspian when their fight against the telmarines gets off to a bad start a black dwarf nikabrik a hag and a wer wolf to use lewis s spelling plan to resurrect jadis to fight for them as they consider her a lesser evil than the current ruler king miraz despite caspian s insistence that the witch was far worse than miraz and his tutor s insistence that the witch is dead they are then killed in a melee which involves caspian his tutor dr cornelius and peter and edmund who have been recalled to narnia after caspian blows susan s horn on the orders of aslan and the newly crowned king caspian narnia is now a land in which humans and talking animals are encouraged to integrate and have equal rights jadis does not appear in the voyage of the dawn treader though the stone knife she used to kill aslan at the stone table has been found on ramandu s island by three of the seven great lords of narnia who had been banished there several years earlier disagreeing on what course to take one of them takes up the knife to use against the other two whereupon all three fall into an enchanted sleep the knife may be intended as an analogy to the holy lance the spear used to pierce jesus christ according to the gospel of john 2 in the silver chair 1 356 years after her death jadis is described as one of the northern witches along with the lady of the green kirtle a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit narnia glimfeather the owl speculates that the green lady may be of the same crew as the white witch this has led to speculation by some readers that jadis and the lady of the green kirtle may be the same person lewis s text does not support this see lady of the green kirtle for further discussion lewis never clarifies the green lady s origins or what connection she has to the white witch the green lady had first entered narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of king caspian and later re emerged in human form to lure away caspian s son rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld eustace scrubb and jill pole reach the underworld with their guide puddleglum the marshwiggle and rescue rilian who kills the green lady before they return to narnia characteristics edit an extraordinarily beautiful tall and imposing woman jadis enchants digory kirke andrew ketterley and edmund pevensie on first encounters she is seven feet tall as were all members of the royal family of charn after eating the fruit of eternal life her skin becomes as white as paper a natural born sorceress and a cunning strategist jadis is arrogant and cruel considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished after she eats the fruit of everlasting life selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified her callousness and sense of entitlement are most clearly demonstrated when she uses the deplorable word in charn to vanquish her sister even though the word would eradicate all life in that world but her own she prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister s authority and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions though her magic disappears when she leaves charn she manages to build it up again in narnia s world exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world s dawning to become again a sorceress of formidable power though she is still outclassed by aslan she eventually usurps the throne of narnia using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter her most feared weapon is her wand whose magic is capable of turning people into stone the petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle for the brief time that jadis is on earth she has no magical power but retains her phenomenal strength this is demonstrated when she battles with metropolitan police in london wielding the cross bar she wrenched from a lamp post the same cross bar is taken into the new world that would become narnia and grows into the full lamp post encountered by lucy pevensie many years later portrayals edit radio edit the voice of jadis was provided by elizabeth counsell in focus on the family s radio drama versions of the lion the witch

3 kellerman was retained as the hag in season 2 and the lady of the green kirtle in season 3 characters from the second and fourth narnia novels after her wand is broken she runs up the ravine only for aslan to arrive with reinforcements and roar enough for the ground to shake and the white witch to lose her balance and fall to her death in the original novel it is stated that jadis is half djinn and half giant theatrical film series edit tilda swinton as jadis the white witch her collar is made from aslan s mane taken during his sacrifice in the 2005 walt disney pictures feature film the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe she was portrayed by british actress tilda swinton swinton s performance won particular acclaim among fans and critics bbc film critic stella papamichael wrote 4 as the cold hearted white witch tilda swinton sets the tempo for this bracing adventure she is a pristine picture of evil like the spectre of nazism that forces the children out of london to the sanctuary of a country manor jadis is viewed as significantly more psychopathic and malevolent possessing an instinctively violent streak and the expressed disregard for the lives of others during the battle of beruna she declares that no prisoners are to be taken simply since she has no interest in taking any she is also hinted to have a cynical dry sense of humour tilda swinton was nominated for an mtv movie award for best villain for her performance as the white witch in the lion the witch and the wardrobe but lost to hayden christensen for his performance as anakin

montana and moved to new york city working at moe vernon s auto repairs starting out as a new york city policeman in 1938 he was inspired by action comics superman and the real life exploits of hooded justice to take up the life of a vigilante he was nicknamed nite owl for spending his evenings working out in the police gymnasiums as much as possible and going to bed at 9 00pm to rise for a 5 00am workout before donning his badge and uniform his costume was designed to free his arms and legs while protecting his chest abdomen and head with a tough leather tunic with the tunic hiding his hair a domino mask concealed his identity he became a member of the minutemen a masked adventurer league in mid 1939 mason was an old school crimefighter a real boy scout in the eyes of captain metropolis he stopped colorful criminals like the screaming skull and went on to fight supposed axis operatives including captain axis during world war ii he retired in may 1962 to open an auto business and write his memoir of his crime fighting exploits under the hood by reading under the hood silk spectre ii later learned of the comedian s attempted rape of her mother silk spectre i soon after hollis retired daniel dreiberg sought him out and asked if he could use the name and persona of nite owl to fight crime mason acceded and dreiberg became the second nite owl after nite owl ii and silk spectre ii broke rorschach out of prison on halloween night the knot tops street gang became angered by what they perceived to be vigilantism under the influence of the drug kt 28 the knot tops believed mason to be the same nite owl who participated in the prison break and decided to attack him mason mistook their pounding on his door for trick or treaters and opened the door to their attack mason put up a good fight but the gang leader killed mason by hitting him with the very statue of himself that was given to him by the city as an acknowledgment and reward for his service as a costumed adventurer dreiberg learned about hollis s murder and vowed revenge on the gang as nite owl he beat up one of the knot tops and threatened to kill him and the whole gang before rorschach drew him away to continue the more important mission they were on the entire gang eventually died at the hands of ozymandias monster after being forced to change their identities to avoid government persecution dan and laurie changed their names to sam and sandra with the married surname hollis in tribute to hollis mason daniel dreiberg edit born on september 18 1940 daniel dreiberg a blue beetle like figure relied on both technical wizardry and tools as well as his skills as a fighter which set him apart from his fellow costumed adventurers all of his gadgets and costumes are based on an owl theme he uses an owl shaped flying vehicle nicknamed the owlship or archie short for archimedes after merlin s pet owl in t h white s novel the once and future king equipped with a variety of offensive and defensive devices such as flamethrowers and screechers devices capable of producing a sharp screech like sound dreiberg as nite owl met fellow costumed adventurer rorschach who suggested they partner to take on organized crime the two became not only a team but also best friends he supported the idea of costumed vigilantes forming a group to fight crime strategically but rorschach and the comedian rejected the idea having already come to understand that his expensive activities were too limited in scope to make any real difference dreiberg retired after the passing of the keene act on august 3 1977 in 1985 when the story takes place he seemed to regret his decision to give up crime fighting having no sense of personal fulfillment without it rorschach said regarding his retirement no staying power following the keene act dreiberg contributed scholarly articles to ornithological journals his owl ship represents advancements in propulsion nautical engineering and aerodynamics that would have exceeded the level of technological innovation known at that time suggesting that dreiberg was a genius as a costumed adventurer he would also have had access to fellow hero doctor manhattan s futuristically advanced level of nuclear technology events of watchmen edit dreiberg became romantically entangled with the second silk spectre laurie juspeczyk after she left doctor manhattan he returned to vigilantism along with her following the murder of the comedian their first foray was the successful rescue of the occupants of a burning building the excitement of aiding the residents awakened dreiberg s sexual feelings for laurie and the two made passionate love following the rescue they later broke rorschach out of prison in an attempt to stop ozymandias scheme to save the world from itself unfortunately the freeing of rorschach indirectly resulted in the brutal murder of hollis mason which dan learned of only when he and rorschach interrogated suspects upon learning of mason s death dreiberg became violent attacking the informer and loudly swearing vengeance against mason s killers with such ferocity that rorschach had to restrain him in the end hollis killers the knot tops were killed along with half of new york city by ozymandias plot dan and rorschach traveled to ozymandias antarctic fortress they battled with and were swiftly defeated by ozymandias who revealed his plan to unleash a telepathic monstrosity on new york city that will release massive psychic waves that will kill half the city nite owl expressed the desire to stop him and was told that it already happened millions were dead and the world s nations agreed to work together to combat this new extraterrestrial threat reluctantly dan and the recently arrived dr manhattan and laurie juspeczyk agreed to keep this secret for the sake of world peace the morally absolute rorschach left attempting to take dan s vehicle back to civilization to tell the world unseen by the others doctor manhattan killed rorschach to stop him dan and laurie were offered hospitality by ozymandias which they accepted before leaving for another galaxy manhattan seemed satisfied and happy at the sight of laurie now in a relationship with dan in the conclusion of the story having been assumed to be dead in the attack they were seen in their new identities of sam and sandra hollis in homage to the late

history edit ultra boy first appeared in superboy 98 and was created by jerry siegel and curt swan 2 fictional character biography edit pre crisis edit superboy 98 ultra boy first appeared in superboy 98 1962 in which he was sent back in time to superboy s home town of smallville to prove himself worthy of joining the legion by learning superboy s secret identity in his first adventure he only demonstrated his vision powers known as penetra vision it was implied he had malicious intentions in learning superboy s secret identity later in adventure comics 316 he explained that he could channel his ultra energy to provide him other powers though only one at a time later he was romantically linked for many years with fellow legionnaire phantom girl 3 he was considered one of the legion s big 3 along with superboy and mon el and served two terms as leader 4 5 the names of his parents are crav and mytra nah his girlfriend on rimbor before he joined the legion was an ryd she is later murdered by pulsar stargrave who frames ultra boy for the crime ultra boy is a skilled actor this combined with his rough background on rimbor and social standing helps him infiltrate criminal groups when he appears to go bad this skill also makes him a valuable member of the legion espionage squad he is the only member without overt spy powers legion of super heroes vol 4 edit between volumes 3 and 4 of the legion of super heroes a five year gap in the chronology occurred during which the team disbanded during this period ultra boy proposed to phantom girl but she was apparently killed in an accident now known simply as jo nah he had become a smuggler and an outlaw on his homeworld of rimbor he rejoined the legion after assassins destroyed an entire apartment building trying to kill him a later storyline in the volume 4 legion of super heroes vol 4 annual 1 showed his acting skills it was shown that for years ultra boy had played dumber than he was to not give away any advantage to his foes when the time sorceress glorith began manipulating legion history she figured only the smarter legionnaires might notice her manipulations and thus acted to neutralize ones like brainiac 5 she never suspected ultra boy would figure out her plan which involved provoking a battle between the legion and mordru at the zenith of his power which would destroy or weaken both allowing her to pick up the pieces realizing what this would mean ultra boy first in a fake diplomatic blunder prevented the legion from attacking mordru then in disguise visited mordru and instead provoked him into attacking glorith this proved successful leaving both mordru and glorith severely weakened years later glorith finally figured out who was responsible and in revenge sent phantom girl into the past leaving ultra boy believing her dead later still the legion found themselves on the wrong side of the law and ultra boy adopted a new identity as emerald dragon during the five year gap following the magic wars earth fell under the covert control of the dominators and withdrew from the united planets a few years later the members of the dominators highly classified batch sw6 escaped captivity originally batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenage legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken just prior to ferro lad s death at the hands of the sun eater later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts after earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 6 a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as new earth the sw6 legionnaires including their version of ultra boy remained post zero hour edit in the continuity that follows the 1994 zero hour storyline ultra boy s background is very similar to the original he was a gang leader on rimbor running a gang called the emerald dragons a reference to his five years later identity before being eaten by an ultra energy beast and gaining his powers from eating the creature s flesh he initially does not join the legion but instead joins a rival group called the workforce and is briefly romantically linked to spider girl sussa paka before meeting and falling in love with apparition the post zero hour incarnation of phantom girl when the workforce and legion are stranded on planet hell a prison complex located inside the sun eventually ultra boy leaves the workforce and becomes a member of the legion ultra boy and apparition eventually marry and have a son named cub just before the legion s reality was rebooted for the second time 2005 reboot edit the legion was rebooted again in 2005 ultra boy in this version seems much the same as his previous versions but does not have a romantic link with phantom girl he is in a relationship with shadow lass trained by karate kid in a more responsible and tactical use of his superpowers it s known by at least triplicate girl that on rimbor he is charged for a crime he never committed but refuses to say more on the question he is later cleared of this crime revealed to be vehicular homicide when legion business manager m rissy discovered evidence that led to his innocence 7 kinder and mellower than his gruff exterior may express he s the first one to sense imra s displeasure and insecurities for being constantly neglected by her boyfriend lightning lad this however leads to a brief affair with the titanian girl post infinite crisis edit the events of the 2005 2006 infinite crisis storyline have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis on infinite earths legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics ultra boy is included in their number in the watchmen sequel doomsday clock ultra boy is among the legion of super heroes members that appear in the present after doctor manhattan undid the experiment that erased the legion of super heroes and the justice society of america 8 powers and abilities edit ultra boy s source of power comes from exposure of the radiation inside the ultra energy beast and is not dependent on yellow sun radiation in the legion of super heroes vol 4 annual 1 his power is described as his body having absorbed the ultra radiation which then adapted to an invulnerable state a default position when he shifts the energy to his muscles it increases his strength or optical powers if he concentrates the energy on his eyes ultra boy has the powers of superhuman strength flight penetra vision similar to superboy s x ray vision except penetra vision allows him to see through lead flash vision similar to heat vision invulnerability and ultra speed although he has never been shown having super hearing all of these abilities seem to be at kryptonian power levels whereas superman s heat vision is usually depicted as red beams ultra boy s flash vision is usually at least in silver age adventures depicted as blue beams ultra boy s principal weakness is that he can only use one power at a time i e if he is invulnerable he is not super strong or able to see through objects this makes him open to sudden attacks if he is unable to shift from one power to another in time he cannot use his ultra speed to break the time barrier since the stress would destroy his body he is also vulnerable to x radiation which affects him as much as kryptonite harms kryptonians ultra boy is an exceptional actor and has used his skills on many legion adventures it has been useful combined with his rough exterior to have his fellow legionnaires think him less smart than he is this is the reason that although his powers don t lend themselves to espionage such as shrinking violet chameleon boy and invisible kid he is a valuable member of the legion espionage squad along with the skills mentioned above he has twice been elected as leader of the legion and has served several terms as deputy leader equipment edit as a member of the legion of super heroes he is provided a legion flight ring it allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments with his legion flight ring or earlier flight belt he can use another power while flying in other media edit television edit in superman the animated series ultra boy made a cameo appearance in the 1998 episode new kids in town ultra boy appeared in a 2006 episode of justice league unlimited titled far from home he is among the legion of super heroes members who are mind controlled by the fatal five ultra boy first appeared in the fifth episode of the legion of super heroes episode champions voiced by james arnold taylor jo nah appeared as a participant in the intergalactic games an olympics like event in which lightning lad also competes when the fatal five attack the games jo along with kem of bismoll helps the legion defeat them calling out the names of four of his various ultra powers as he activates them super strength invulnerability super speed freezing breath phantom girl compliments his skills and thinks to herself that he s cute in the first season finale jo nah made a cameo in costume having been sent by his home planet to help the legion stop the sun eater he also appeared in the episode in the beginning and the season two finale dark victory in supergirl alex danvers makes reference to an actor from rimbor v that plays king george iii in the musical hamilton potentially referring to ultra boy toys edit in the champions role playing game the term ultra slot is used to describe one of the powers within a framework in which only one power can be used at a time the multipower framework is based directly on ultra boy and in fact was originally called the ultra hence ultra slot references edit cadigan glen ed 2004 the best

the character he intended ferro lad to be black but editor mort weisinger vetoed the idea 3 saying we ll lose our distribution in the south 4 this was in fact one reason why shooter chose ferro lad to be the one to die in the sun eater story in a 2003 interview shooter said ferro lad i killed because my plan was that he was a black guy and mort weisinger said no then i said well let s see i ve got this idea for a story and someone needs to die ah ha him so basically i killed him off because it annoyed me that i couldn t do with him what i wanted 5 however in a 2011 blog post he had a different explanation i thought mort might object if i killed an established long term legionnaire but what if it was one of the new ones i d created maybe that would fly so i did it i didn t ask i just did it why ferro lad because his powers suited the opportunity how would princess projectra or even karate kid survive the death run into the heart of the sun eater 6 shooter made double sure that ferro lad would stay dead by setting the next issue ten years in the future in which a statue of ferro lad is on display in the legion s hall of the honored dead 6 the life and death of ferro lad isbn 978 1 4012 2193 5 a hardcover trade paperback collecting the silver age appearances of ferro lad was released in 2009 fictional character biography edit silver age edit andrew nolan is a metahuman with the power to transform himself into living iron 7 he has a twin brother named douglas who has the same power both twins have deformed faces as a side effect of the mutation that gave them their powers so both wear iron masks he first appears in adventure comics 346 july 1966 he joined at the same time as princess projectra karate kid and nemesis kid ferro lad was only a legionnaire for a short time when he was killed destroying the sun eater with a bomb in adventure comics 353 his self sacrifice to save the galaxy made him legendary despite his short tenure as a legionnaire with many later silver age stories featuring references to his death both the event itself and a statue erected in his memory was often visible in the legion s headquarters he next appears in adventure comics 357 june 1967 but as a ghost seemingly saving a number of his former teammates from a controller representative of a race of superior beings many years later during the five year gap following the magic wars earth fell under the covert control of the dominators and withdrew from the united planets some time thereafter the members of the dominators highly classified batch sw6 escaped captivity originally batch sw6 appeared to be a group of teenage legionnaire clones created from samples apparently taken just prior to ferro lad s death at the hands of the sun eater later they were revealed to be time paradox duplicates every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts after earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of krypton over a millennium earlier 8 a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as new earth the sw6 legionnaires remained and their version of ferro lad shortened his code name to ferro post zero hour edit in post zero hour continuity he is known as ferro and comes from 20th century earth born in the 20th century andrew nolan and his twin douglas were the sons of a famous actress nancy nolan who abandoned them because of their grotesque facial deformities 1 9 left in the care of an unscrupulous scientist called doc 30 he escaped while douglas remained behind when the earth was dying due to the extinguishing of the sun in the so called final night he first helps perry white who was determined the daily planet would not miss one day of delivery then he becomes involved with the legion of super heroes who had become stranded in the present day this team joins with dozens of other superheroes to help try to save the earth ferro comes close to heroically sacrificing his life in an effort to stop the sun eater at the last instant he is saved by hal jordan who was maintaining the power and identity of parallax jordan seemingly sacrifices his own life and the sun is restored ferro remains with the team although it was some time before they informed him they were from the 31st century 1 when the legion were able to return to their home time ferro went with them and served with them for some time until several of the team were lost in a rift and the remainder ordered to disband after this he went with karate kid to a monastery on the planet steeple a planet only accessible for short periods every ten years before a black hole prevented access once more while there he finally learned to deal with his deformity but he was savagely beaten by an escaped convict and while the monks were able to save his life he was trapped in iron form with the helmet he wore fused to his face moreover he and karate kid who had refused to leave his friend behind were now trapped on the planet for ten years citation needed brainiac 5 was able to use the threshold technology he had learned of during his time lost to open a path to steeple but before anyone could use it he along with all of the legion bar sensor and shikari and several whole planets were entranced by universo citation needed sensor and shikari were forced to use the unstable link to steeple to escape and the four of them were able to free saturn girl who with aid from apparition and ultra boy s child cub was able to defeat universo while ferro and karate kid rejoined the team citation needed the lightning saga edit the events of the infinite crisis miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the pre crisis legion to continuity as seen in the lightning saga story arc in justice league of america and justice society of america and in the superman and the legion of super heroes story arc in action comics andrew is depicted as a member of this version of the team in justice society of america vol 3 5 june 2007 and action comics 858 late december 2007 however this incarnation of the legion shares roughly the same history as the original legion up to the events of crisis on infinite earths 10 therefore this version of andrew is presumably deceased powers edit ferro lad had the superhuman ability to transform his body into a nearly indestructible isotope of iron unlike stone boy ferro lad had full mobility and could think and speak normally his iron like form could resist considerable damage including direct hits by laser blasts and he was able to survive unprotected in the vacuum of space he could use his ability offensively by ramming his iron hard body into an opponent or an obstacle his physical strength also increased when in his iron state allowing him to bend metal bars or reshape scrap metal like clay equipment edit as a member of the legion of super heroes he was provided a legion flight ring it allowed him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments he also had a radio built into his mask which allowed him to communicate with others while in airless space other versions edit in legion of super heroes vol 2 300 an alternate universe is glimpsed by andrew nolan s brother douglas here it is shown that shortly after andrew s death against the sun eater douglas became the second ferro lad in a parallel timeline in amalgam

romance with fellow legionnaire wildfire they each respected the other s defiant outspoken personality although they counseled each other on working with their talents as part of a team instead of
